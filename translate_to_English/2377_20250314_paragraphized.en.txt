Mr. Xu Xiang, General Manager Mr. Jinqiu, and Mr. Guo Xuguang, General Manager of the Executive Department, will start to present the company's speech and financial center. After the speech, we will start to ask questions, and then start the meeting today.

First of all, let's report that the five years of sound life is worse than the sound life. In 2024, the entire company's sound life is about 1978 billion, about the peak of 2021 during the five years of the epidemic, this time a peak, the age growth is about 80%, this line with the company's estimated set is a little bit of a little bit of a small community. The music trade is about 24 billion, about 24 billion, about 24 billion, and about this year, about 253, the age growth is about 5.9,000. Cleaning up here is not ideal, about 700 million, this is obvious, this is the relatively poor part, this is more attention.

The whole company's products are roughly three categories: our main price goods, Campola, are graphics cards, Maspo, flat temperature. That 2024, this part is also the main focus of our company's revenue, about 40%-45%. The system, including Maspo, on a daily basis, the desktop and monitor, this is missing to 40%-45%, which is a little more beautiful, and there is a slight growth. The other part, including charging, etc., is probably the company's system line, which is relative to the company's industry, not a principal.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the provided verbatim fragments every timestamped sentence. It is necessary to group these sentences in logical and contextual relationships to form a coherent paragraph.

For example, some sentences may have overlapping or jumping over timestamps and need to be arranged according to the content. In addition, pay attention to the correct spelling of the terminology and brand names, such as "HOMEPLANE", "Bis", "Aziz", etc., to ensure accuracy. There is also need to deal with some stuttering or duplication of spoken language, such as "this one," "this one, this one," etc., which may need to be retained during conversions, but enhance readability through paragraph separation. At the same time, attention to the correct presentation of numbers and percentages, such as "98 billions" may be required to confirm whether the corresponding sentences are "98 billions" or other correct formats.

At the same time, keep the order and content of the original to avoid any modification or deletion. Finally, after the conversion, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to check if the user's requirements are met, make sure that no sentences are missing, and the transition between paragraphs is natural and logical. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to further confirm, but according to the example provided by the user, it should be kept as simple as possible to adjust the format.

Since 2011, it has also started to transform into HOMEPLANE, and to the present day, HOMEPLANE has already accounted for about 98 million of the company's turnover. Therefore, the most important thing in running HOMEPLANE is to start marketing in 2011, so we are on a marketing trip, and we want to continue to enter. That was a recent time we wanted to hit a premium, so we found a partner, which is usually a company on the world trip. So you can see, we were called Bis about 4 years ago, she was called Bis, and later called Aziz, her AGM, her AGM, her AGM, her one of the sports car, which should have a very wide range of scales around the world.

So, we have a lot of resources in our company recently, where you can see us leading, a lot like a choice, etc. We also participate in a lot of products, those that lead our entire micro-star in this type of brand support, which brings us a benefit. That last year, we also knew that the innovation of PC was a very well-known magazine in the United States, and that through the user's vote, this is not our relationship with the media, we voted for our own media, and we were probably not the first in the media.

You can see a lot of the comments we have with their counterparts, this is a big company, bank, I think we are in the media, in the minds of users in the United States, we are a very fine refining, this is really a big help to us in driving this high-end marketing, which in addition to notebooks, our microcouple and table also brings some of the effects of some of the effects.

I'm here for a simple report, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, today's show, thank you. Dear friends, media friends, I'm going to report some of our company's financial situation with you in a simple way. Last year our total revenue was $197.8 billion, probably more than about eight percentages in 2023. If we look at our revenue growth with a footprint, that's probably a relatively high percentage, but in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter we started a little slow, we made a relatively in depth combination with NVIDIA's Gaming, it's about two years we launched a new product, the results of Q3 Q4 last year when these new products were some tired, so we started to Q3 Q4 when we started.

We start at Q3 Q4. We start at Q3 Q4. We start at Q3 Q4. We start at Q3.

In Q3 Q4, we started. So we started. So, we started. We were in the fourth quarter, especially in the fourth quarter.

Like us 4. 70 or more. 80 90 is almost unbreakable. It's not broken at all. Middle of the product if there's something to tighten. Then the whole thing goes on.

There will be some restrictions. At the same time. It also suppresses our gross profit margin. I think a new product comes out. Its price can push a lot. Like our initial downhill graphics card or we can't go east.

In the beginning, it might be more than five years later than the later products. Slowly, the footprint may be reduced. Because the popularity of the products and the price of the rise and so on factors. So overall, we are very sorry. We fell from 12.7 to only 10.3 in the fourth quarter last year. This is also a low for us over the years.

I think the majority of our companies are gaming-oriented. Gaming is not a new product. One is that the product will have some difficulties in the supply. So there will be the whole of the product. There will be some difficulties in the supply.

Gross profit margin has some impact. That's the other side of the fee. We look at our fees for 2023 only 7.78. 2022 only 8.38. 2024 has fallen to 8.68. There are about 1.7 billion in the middle.

It's 1.4 billion here. It's about 3 billion. We look at it here. The cost rate is probably from here. The fourth quarter of the second quarter starts gradually. One of the more significant reasons is last year's second quarter.

In the first quarter, there was a rise in pressure. etc. So these caused the whole shipping fee. All of a sudden, we jumped up 50%. Especially our overall shipping. In Europe, we were about 40% faster than the system.

One is about two or three weeks. One is about 56% higher price. Plus last year. Q3 Q4 has no new product launch. So we talk about the mid-term price.

You will not be able to afford it, but most of them will be able to afford it, and most of them will be able to afford it.

As you can see, this is a step by step jump. Most of us will fall below 8%. Then come up. Last year the light shipping impact. The cost to the company is about 1.1 billion.

That's part of it. Because there is no new product launch, so there is no price change. After the new product launch, we will take into account the impact of this shipping cost.

Do some further adjustments. The other part I think is ours. Expenses. Probably ours. RD cost is about 1 billion more, mostly over the years.

As we have seen, we have been told by the general manager that we have invested in the SERVO part. There are some AIOT part. There are some parts in the car. There are others.

It is like a sponge, and it takes time, for example, an AI SERVO. It goes from development to product.

It is not necessary to have a certification, about a year and a half before the end of the year, and then go through the certification of the client, etc.

So we've been developing products like SERVO for almost two years. In the second half of the year, we'll start shipping on land. Some revenues like we've developed charging piles. That time may be longer.

Like it's not just a charging pile. It's followed by a lot. It's a cash flow. The system needs to be combined. There's also a TV with the license plate. There are some local ones.

That statutory requirement is to pass its certification. This takes a long time. Change. This may take up to next year.

This is a long-term layout of the company. I think this. It is like charging piles, etc. These cars will gradually become a mainstream in the future. So let's look at the overall economic situation of the last year. We both have big markets.

The U.S. has become a recession in the system. I. One is not a new product. The second is a high share order and a high interest rate.

Let the end user of the United States. Translation set. So everyone is competing above the price. That is, China also I want a market that needs to be inside, or there is a slight contraction, so the two markets caused by this.

Last year, we made a profit, so the system side, that is, the maintenance of a little bit of flat growth.

[1285. 80-1289. 88] However, as BRC has two major markets in the United States, it has some conditions, so that the overall growth of our growth is gone. [1295. 52-1298. 08] The experience I want to look forward to this overall U.S. economy, cut interest rates, and so on, I want to introduce a new product, for this important market, the U.S. Europe, I want to be a good stimulus factor. [1310. 42-1312. 72] In general, we will gradually recover, we see that MVDA in the first three quarters, it will probably have more than a dozen convenient parts, and a dozen more revenue growth. [1321. 16-1322. 44] It is also recovery growth, so it is a new product. [1328. 34-1329. 36] It is a bit slow, and we are a little sorry that this year when Q4.

[1336. 58-1339. 90] So the overall operating economy is 1.08, in the last few years you see our business economy, probably maintained at about 15%. [1346.130-1350. 40] Of course, it has some benefits of the pandemic in 22 years, but the company's goal is still to maintain this piece at 15%, or even more than 5%. [1356. 28-1359. 10] Like the introduction of new products like our VGA, this wave is also the introduction of XIA's Koer, the whole Nordic main release, probably the operating economy is only more than 45%, should be normal. [136. 80-1372. 16] This we will also work in this direction, so the pre-tax economy, obviously we will decline to 85%, mainly in Q3 Q4, subject to the cost of our RB investment resources. [1364.

[1415. 72-1423. 20] If we look at our weakness, then we are about 30 billion, because we have a slight weakness in the weakness in 2022 [1428. 32-1430. 62] So we are very positive about the weakness in our control, and the weakness is expected to be below about 70 days. [1435. 48-1440. 60] Because we will have some compound security stock at least two or three weeks, at least one or two weeks. [1445. 72-1451. 14] Then most of the system products are to be shipped to Europe in 70 days, about 40 days. [145. 141-1457. 04] In some of our own products, we have to do some inventory for this product.

[1470. 10-1475. 46] We are now about 236,680 million in February, and our revenue is about 330 340, almost two or three months. [1479. 10-1481. 92] On the one hand, we are a little early for this year's year, so we say we have a little early for stock preparation. [1487. 04-1490. 36] Now we have more than 90 days in stock, and there is probably a way to clean up the stock of the last year. [1492. 16-1495. 48] It looks like we are about to introduce new products through some promotions, etc., and so we can sort of worry about some new products when the safety stock is in less than two months. [1499. 84-1504. 70] Then we are about seven days in stock week, and I have reportedly.

[1517. 04-1518. 58] This is a little bit more, but the main thing is to prepare for the month of January. [1525. 74-1527. 02] Fifty-six days to receive funds, about forty days on Wednesday, about fifty-eight days. [1532. 90-1538. 02] Above is some of today's financial reports and the entire business report. [1539. 10-1541. 66] Last year's overall performance was not as expected, and I think it was not a new product, which was the overall economic performance of the U.S. and BRC. [1549. 08-1551. 64] So we didn't perform well in two major markets. [1557. 78-1559. 06] We're trying to improve today, thank you all.
