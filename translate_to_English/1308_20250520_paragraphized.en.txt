Hello, I would like to invite you to participate in the Taiwan Aggregate Chemicals Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd. The first is to introduce you to the management team of today's Aggregate Chemicals Co., Ltd., Mr. Wu Pingji, Mr. Wu Mingzhongye Wu Deputy General Manager, and Mr. Guo Jiahua Accounting Manager, Mr. Wu Peiji, Mr. Huang Keming Business Director of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd., and Mr. Zhang Shengchuan Accounting Manager of Asia Aggregate Chemicals Co., Ltd.

First of all, let's report on the company's earnings and financial situation for us. Thank you. So now is a news, business program to participate in the message. So at hari world 05, you, today's briefing outline is divided into four parts.

First of all, I will report the company's profile, product introduction, operational overview and outlook. Then the third part will be reported by our quick manager Zhang. After the report is over, we will host the Q&A section by our general manager.

As of April 30th, the number of employees of the company was 231. The first quarter combined turnover was 15.3 million, almost the same as the same period last year. At present, we have 4 sets of high-pressure production lines with a total capacity of 150,000 tonnes. The main products we produce are LDP and EVA.

In this section, you can see some of the medical devices, some of the packaging of semiconductors, and some of the low-class protective film we call the low-class. Another more important application is food packaging, domestically known as the talent packaging, and even this library of the coffee cup that we drink from supermarkets. There are some electronic packaging and unused products, including cosmetic packaging. This part is the strength of our products, used in some comparison requirements are relatively high, and we have been working hard over the years.

The second part is the overview of the operation and the outlook. So let's first look at the upstream raw material. Our upstream raw material is vinyl and crude oil. The first part of the crude oil is actually because it rose to that peak in mid-January this year, about January 15th, after all, because the global trade conflict is still largely uncertain about the outlook for future economic growth.

In addition, the OPEC has already mentioned some information about the fact that in March, April, or even May, they not only do not plan to cut production, but also also plan to increase production, so the price of crude oil has started to slide down from mid-January, and the purple part is ethylene. The first part of ethylene is that some petrochemical plants in mainland China have some new capacity, but its new capacity has been downstreamed, but the upstream part is not completed, so in January, when they have to go to the market to buy ethylene, so the price of ethylene is relatively strong. The second reason is that there are some petrochemical plants in South Korea in January, so the part of February is relatively strong.

The green line above is the Tufu EVA, the blue line is the high EVA content, the orange line is the normal 14% to 20% of the foam level EVA, we will see basically in the first quarter is the trend of going up. Then the LDP market is relatively stable, and it is basically flat in January and February, and there is a slight decline in March, but the decline is not too large. So we take a look at the text description. Then the operation of LDP in the first quarter because there is a major petrochemical plant it produces land volume LDP that the current news is that it may stop production after the second quarter is about the end of this month.

The LDP of Aggregate is also its strength, so it imports the market at the first quarter it once rose to 1400% or more, so it's just the strength of Aggregate's products, so we have to fight for such opportunities to adjust our product portfolio in the first quarter, so to increase the production volume of LDP in the first quarter, so the sales volume of the LDP in the first quarter increased by about 40%. So you may be concerned that our products will not be affected by this U.S. tariff policy, and that in the LDP part of the product is mainly domestic sales, the export part of this part is mainly in the mainland China, and it is mainly in the financial packaging or I just mentioned coffee cups or these unused products, which are mainly in the domestic market, so the impact of the U.S. tariff policy is relatively small.

In the first quarter, EVA was a decrease in production, but EVA was not only a decrease in production, but also in the first quarter of the year. In the second quarter, EVA's gross profit margin was significantly higher than last year, so our production line was not too big in addition to the necessary cuts. In addition to this, we continued to expand the market of EVA's, the Tuku-level EVA is the strength of our company, not too many manufacturers in Asia, and the technical difficulty of this product is relatively high, which is one of the direction we are going to develop in the future.

EVA's sales volume is significantly reduced in part of EVA's treasuries, which is 1,101,124 tons, compared with the first quarter of last year, or increased by hundreds of tons of EVA's total treasuries, mainly in the photovoltaic level EVA and foam level EVA. The photovoltaic level of EVA is 4719 tons, although it is still higher than the first quarter of last year because of the fact that the photovoltaic level is quite poor, but we have an average of about 56,000 tons of photovoltaic levels in about a month, but it is only 4700 tons in the first quarter of the first quarter.

The second reason is that China's photovoltaic boom in this country has a policy here in April 30 and May 31, in which we have a separate policy in this country, and in this case, we have a few restrictions on the fact that the U.S.'s share of direct imports is less than 1%, but its biggest impact is that even after the U.S.-China trade negotiations come out of this uncertainty, but it is impossible to completely eliminate the uncertainty of the market, which leads to the next outlook. Since the beginning of April, we have a very clear feeling that the exporter has a clear shrinking hand order, of the U.S. and China's negotiations have a little change, but there is no way back to the state before that.

In the first quarter of the company, the combined financial information, see here, this is the combined water meter. The combined revenue of the first quarter of the company is 15.3 billion, which is about 27 million less than the same period last year. This change is mainly due to the sales volume of the first quarter of this year was about 3% less than the same period last year, and the price portion was about 2% higher than the previous year's average price.

So the total amount of the relatively small price has some, so the average amount of the total sales is about 27 million less than the same period last year. Then see the gross profit margin in the first quarter of this year is 100 million million gross profit margin is 7%, which is about 94 million more than the same period last year's gross profit margin.

The operating gold interest rate is 2%, which is not enough to deduct the expenditure of business outside of business, which is about $2.6 billion, which is mainly due to the loss of $250 million. The tax economic losses of the first quarter after deducting the business outside of business expenses are 225 million. Then the net loss of income after deducting the income tax cost of the first quarter after the net loss of 2.37 million. Then the estimated loss of each share in the first quarter of 59.11 is 0.4 dollars. Then take a look at the financial ratio, then the first quarter of the year has just mentioned that the operating gold interest is 36 million. All the operating profit rate is 2%, then the net loss after deducting the operating expenses is 15%.

The ratio of the third debt-war assets increased as the total withdrawal amount increased from 11 at the end of 2023 to 16 at the end of the 16th quarter of last year was also 16. The liquidity ratio was 279 in the first quarter, and the speed ratio of 203 was slightly lower than the previous year. The average revenue was 30 and the average consumption day was 41, so it was probably not much change in the past.

In the meantime, we now look directly at the turnover below, which combined the turnover of 121.47 million in the first quarter of this year. That is, compared to the same period last year, the combined part of the industry in fact, about 68 million more than this year. The whole group is probably a small gap between the companies of this trend. We look at the turnover of this year, but there is still a slight difference from last year.

The first quarter of this year's exchange rate was about 32.9, and the first quarter of that year's exchange rate was only 31.4. The overall impact of this kind of interlacing is about a little bit more turnover. Let's take a look at the first quarter of this year's Taiwan reunion we introduced here is mainly about the two factories of the so-called EVA high pressure method, the other part of our low pressure method P, and the other part of the CBC.

So in the first quarter of this year, in addition to the necessary repairs, almost all of the production capacity was opened, although 50,000 tons of EVA, if we say that we averaged an average of 1,000 months, that means that the quarter should be 3,000.3 That is, if this is the first quarter of 31919 tons, the working rate has reached 97%. Compared to the same period last year, only about 8,000 tons of EVA, so this year's performance is better compared to the first quarter of this year compared to the previous year's volume, but the price is just a bit lower compared to the last year.

This year, almost seven percent of the year's doubles were very good for us, and we will continue to look at this one after the same period last year. Let's take a closer look at this part of the area where Aiji is just now living in. We'll take a closer look at the part of this golden face on the far right side of the back. The blue gold face below the obvious camping friend has a significant decline in the economic environment and the Trump tariff problem that caused this year's year.

This year, [1602. 62-1604. 66] from this, [1604. 92-1605. 94] 7 80's to that moment to 59. That, [1610. 56-1611. 32], [1611. 58-1613. 12] For the first time, [1613. 42-1616] 24's at the end of the first quarter almost 60, [16. 48-1617. 60, [1617. 26-1617. 76] 62. That was slightly above, [16. 02-1619. 56] and around May. This year's oil price would be lower than last year, [162.11664.1664.64] If the price of this year's oil would be lower, [1626.16.1664.

[1647. 76-1650. 32] For us this year, [1650. 58-1651. 86] This is a relatively favorable year compared to last year's forecast of the west will last, [1658. 78-1662. 62] It is a relatively low 800 points compared to last year's comparison compared to last year's comparison compared to last year's comparison. [1668. 78-1665. 44] This is the only one that will be helpful to us, [1669. 78-1671. 06] What is the difference behind us, [1663. 421-1674. 18] [1686. This is the part of our price, [1730. 80-1732. 86] The two below just in the purple west, [1733. 42-1736. 24] The following two just in the purple west, [1736. 48-1740. 22] We just stated that the consumption of the first quarter was reduced by 44 pieces, [1740. 32-1746. 22] The cost of each ton of 44 pieces was reduced by 97, [1746. 48-1748] is not enough, [1748-1748] 52-1749. 54, but this VAM, [1749. 80-1753. 38] The consumption of our eva, accounted for about 30% of the VAM, [1756-1753-1756] The amount of the amount was reduced by 121, [1756. 78 [1811. 02-1812. 30] The other two are the products, [1812. 56-1814. 62] The gathering is relatively high, [1814. 86-1815. 90] This is the answer, [1816. 14-1816. 92] The high, [1817. 18-1818. 46] The HD is relatively high, [1820. 70-1819. 98] The reason for that the gathering, [1822. 60-1823. 62] Also, [1823. 88-1825] The fact that the comparison of boutiques will be higher than this, [1826. 1856-1847] This is the result of [1856. 1864. 1864. 1864. 02] Including sales volume including the impact of the exchange rate than last year, [1881 26-1882. 04] This loss, [1882. 60-1882. 86] A little bit more, [1883. 10-1887. 46] But this is a profit from P1 herecover, [1883. 72-1892. 06] In fact, if P1 adds up after EVA, [1892. 32-1893. 60] compared with 1893. 86-18964. 42] Last year, [1896-1897] less losses, [1898. 22-1899] basically, [1898. 50-1972] This trend P1 we talk about P1, [195.1.19] This time we lost only about 600 million, [19.19.19. This is the same as it was reduced to 1900, 191. 54 0004 tonnes, [1961. 80-1965. 12] That was better than the same period last year, but this if [1965. 38-969. 98] was not the best time to compare with the previous year, [1970. 24-1971. 78] forward in 2021, [1971. 78-197.2. 80] If we, [1973. 06-1978. 44] two long EVA P1 can reach more than 270,000 OEMs, [1978. 70-1979. 72] On that day, [1979. 98-1982. 54] was better than last year, but in fact this, [1982. 78-1986] was not in those years, [1982-1986] Good, [1988. 94-1990. 22] We looked at the same time as last year, [2019. 54-2009. 54. 16) as well.

We also have an increase in sales in Southeast Asia and even in India. This obviously shows that the sales of the spectrum are much higher compared to the same period last year. Go straight to the fourth point and see if the spectrum already accounts for about 30 percent of the same period last year.

In addition to the impact of US tariffs on the special cable needs of high-end brands, we have been hit by the fact that in the previous few weeks we will meet Taiwan and even Asia Focus in this rather special one of those special ones are relatively making money, although this amount will be relatively small, but these relatively high-quality products have some impact on the U.S. tariffs. Fortunately, the recent U.S.-China negotiating that there is relatively moderate that there is a rather positive direction for these high-quality customers to develop, so when these customers who copy their sales should slowly return to normal after June.

In addition, in this part of PE, we also gave Western DEF is a better development in Q1 compared to last year or the same period last year, and that is, we are affected by the conflict between China and China trade relations, but in terms of export, some of these customers will turn to us to buy this PE, so we have maintained the market in DG domestic sales. Because we have some business opportunities here to actively fight for export, so our sales volume of PE in the same period last year was increased by 10.1%, and the other small amount of PE LDP in the same period in DG was increased by about 10.1%, the other is the small amount of PE LDP of the company that they identified as a product for Taiwan giant, a small amount of Asian giant OEM service customers to look at this demand. But his self-sufficiency rate with his capacity increased from the same time last year to the same time that he had reached the same time to the same time this year to 67167 million thousand tons of self-sufficiency rate that he has reached 83 after this time, this EVA China EVA's capacity will be added in the last quarter of about two months, we just put it here to make the first quarter of the law that no one can refer to us take a look at the EVA on the right.

So today in the first quarter, the price of PV is better, so our share is up to about 49%, and that is the second quarter of EVA's new capacity to the redstone part he has put into production, there are already 3.1 million tons of tonnes already close to the mainland's home-bound demand, so the future self-pick up rate will be higher and higher, there will be three red wells, and the second quarter may not be this week, they have more than 200,000 new capacity will come out in Korea, and there will be more than 300,000 new capacity in June. We look at the operation of the second quarter to look at the first oil side.

This year's oil price is estimated to be around 70 to 80, which is likely to be 60 to 70, which is relatively lower compared to last year's oil. This is lower for the later we take a look at vinyl, then it is now about 780 790, which is much lower compared to the same year last year's same time, this is a lot of operating space for us, that is, this cost reduction plus the Taiga Group has an Intercontinental two-tier terminal close to completion, so it is likely that from June we've removed only 10000 to 40,000 tonnes of the operating space from the original we's we've been able to buy at the right time when we talked about a small loss of this year, and if there is a more flexible vinyl to adjust to our second half-year's operation, we've just explained that we's a lot of this a lot of this. This is the first time that we have been able to increase the sales revenue in the first quarter of 2025. This is the first time that we have seen a consolidated review of the consolidated sales revenue in the first quarter of 2025. This is the first time that we have increased the sales revenue in the second quarter of the year. This is the second year that we have been able to increase the sales revenue in the second quarter of 2025.

This is mainly due to the decrease in the gross profit of goods sold in the same period last year compared to the same period last year. This is mainly due to the decrease in gross profit in the total gross profit of goods sold in the same period of the combined subsidiary company, and the decrease in gross profit in the total gross profit of goods sold in the same period last year compared to the same period of the same period, so the total gross profit of goods sold in the same year decreased by 4% of gross profit compared to the same period last year.

Take a look at the consolidated financial ratio analysis. 5% of the consolidated operating profit margin for the first quarter of 2025. The 13% of the outstanding profit margin is mainly due to the loss of the consolidated company product.

In the first quarter of this year, it continued to lose money, so the net worth reduction in debt ratio of Taiwan group was slightly increased compared to the end of last year. The current ratio and speed ratio of the current ratio were 190%. The speed ratio was 136%. That was a slight decrease compared to the previous year.

This is mainly due to the increase in capital expenditure used by a consolidated company to invest in fixed assets. Therefore, the current ratio and speed ratio are slightly reduced compared to previous years. The average receipt days for 45 days consume an average of 54 days and the previous year is largely maintained.

Thank you so much for the sharing of the briefings brought by A&A management team. Now we have a Q&A opinion exchange. Then ask the management team to reply to the questions collected in advance during the registration stage. Thank you. I am Mr. Wu Pei-ki, General Manager of A&A Management Team of A&A. We are now in touch with the problem.

Answer the questions. Please. The legal person also has advanced questions in the media. Please be aware that there are some advanced media friends who are interested in investing in advance registrations. There are some questions. Some are strategies for asking the whole industry to do business.

There is also the trend of China's new capacity expansion. There is also the outlook for the second half of the second half of the year. There has been a reply in the briefing of the just legislative meeting. There is also an investment advanced question about the impact of tariffs on the company. I am here to answer the impact of the exchange rate.

In principle, the company in the operation of the exchange rate is based on the progress level and then the high rate. The exchange rate is safe. So when the market appears a relatively large exchange rate change. That risk is controlled. A relatively low range. That if the market's exchange rate.

It is always estimated to be obvious and beneficial. When it comes to the company, it will be moderate. Adjust some. The ratio of the hedge. So the fluctuations in exchange rates overall are within the scope of the operation control. The other part of the tariffs is not a request.

The impact of the tariffs on Taigai companies is that it includes Taigai companies. There are also Taigai companies that we sell directly to the United States. The occupation is less than 1%. So this direct impact on customers here. The reduction in volume is not too much.

But the most important part of it is that we go down to the customer, there are some customers him, his products, such as footwear industry, especially we are mainly selling some high.

It is a high-value brand. Footwear industry has a part of this product that is sold to the United States. This part is affected by some. That just mentioned some. Wire and cable parts. This part is also slightly affected.

But this part of it is not enough to account for the whole product, it's too big to account for it. It's actually the biggest impact of this uncertainty. It's the economics of our customers for later on.

The vision of the future, not sure when, that's all.

The buying and selling of the supply chain is affected. So it is actually in April. We started in early April. Our orders were clearly perceived to have a contraction. That was later the US and China.

It is better for us than for us; it is better for us than for us; it is better for us than for us; it is better for us on the Day of Resurrection.

It's a good idea to buy and sell, but I personally don't feel like I'm fully recovered.

I don't know if there are any other questions on the site or online colleagues, or if there are any other questions on the media. Well, thanks to the colleagues for the advanced questions and the management team's supplementary explanation. Is there any questions on the online and on-site investment advances to be discussed? The general manager and the director have two questions. The first one is that one.

Solar panels are subject to high tariffs in Southeast Asia. There are habitat problems. Then, in the second half of this year or later, look at China's financial subsidies for solar power.

China. China's solar installation is facing the peak of YY or the peak of the percentage has passed. This all goes down to China's demand. The U.S. habitat problem.

The first one is that one. Guru is in the present. The entire one in the last few quarters. The loss part of his own is basically not very good. There are some follow-up actions in this part. The company wants to make the whole.

The loss continues to fall, or what measures can be shared with us? I'll answer the questions about Gore then. Another question about photovoltaic solar. I'll ask that again. Director Koming answered. The first part of Gore then talks about him.

The molar movement rate of low-season grenades is probably slightly less than 80%. The second quarter of the outlook. It is slightly higher than 80%. So, right up and down.

And the earth shall be shaken, and the waters shall be shaken, and the earth shall be shaken, and the heavens shall be shaken; and the earth shall be shaken, and the heavens shall be shaken.

Then he went on to say, "This is what the Lord has done; this is what the LORD has done; this is what the LORD has done; this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done: this is what the LORD has done."

This is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth, and it is the truth.

At the same time, this raw material. The raw material part is also to try to find more of this source. Hope to be able to. More of this source of raw materials above. Get some cost.

And they shall be brought forth, and they shall be brought forth, and they shall be brought forth: and there they shall be brought forth: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be: and there they shall be:

Mr. Investors. This is the question. This is the part of the Continental Solar Energy. There is also an overseas United States. For this South East Asia tax question, we may first divide.

Three are different.

China's photovoltaic associations put forward long-term outlook is very optimistic. China's solar demand is more than expected every year. China's policy is very supportive of the development of solar energy. China has clear carbon peaks and emissions targets, and in line with this goal, China's solar industry will continue to develop.

China's policies are very beneficial for the development of the solar industry. However, in the overseas sector, China's component factories have set up factories in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia in order to avoid the problems of the United States with China. The components of these factories are mainly sold to China, with only about 25% sales to outside the United States.
