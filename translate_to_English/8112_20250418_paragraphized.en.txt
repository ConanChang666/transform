<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim content provided.

I need to make sure that these duplicated content is preserved without any modification. Then I need to reorganize the sequentially separated verbatim text into a coherent paragraph. This requires identifying logical segmentation points, such as speaking about myself, declaring investment security, discussing company business, financial data, etc. Each paragraph should be around a topic, such as company overview, financial performance, business progress, etc. During the process, I pay attention to the order of the timestamps to ensure that the content is arranged according to the order of the speech. At the same time, I want to check if there are missing sentences, especially those that may be separated wrongly.

In addition, the user mentioned "intelligent intelligence" can be a pen error, but according to the original text, it may be necessary to retain the original unless the user specifically pointed out. But according to the context, this should be "intelligent intelligence electronics", so it may be necessary to confirm whether it is a pen error, but according to the user's requirements, can not modify the original text, so the word "intelligent intelligence" must be retained, although this may be a mistake. However, the user's original text does have "intelligent intelligence group", so it must be retained.

Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph verbatim to ensure that all sentences are correctly arranged without missing or duplicated, and that they meet all the requirements of the user. Especially to check if any sentences are deleted or merged incorrectly, to ensure that they are fully collated in accordance with the original text provided by the user.

This is probably what we've been up to since the Q1 of 2023, and then see this year's Q1. Then you can see that I've just started to talk about the Russian-Ukraine War from the 21- and 22-year trade-type era, but the market wasn't that good. At that time, if you're still marketing to this time, all the major bases would start to check, so many customers started to go back to the original price operation.

So you can see this trend. The trade rate here seems to be relatively high, I may have referred to the previous visit, in fact, the normal trade rate will be about 2.5 to 3.5%. The trade rate is mainly because of some of the previous rigours created, so the trade rate is relatively high. Then I am also about 2.5 to 3.5%, so the trade rate is a bit more normal. Then this side is a little lower, because from about two to three years after the Q2 started to the first half of last year, the entire consumer market did not have any good action, but we have made some decisions, so we would probably think that if the rotation of the rigor to the rigour part of our rigor is actually excluded, the entire trade rate is even if it is a little bit less.

As you can see, I just started to make some corrections in the memory section, because last year's first half price was much higher, so the memory section looked like we also started to make some downward corrections. But the special mention is that we also have some new customers in MTK, we actually have a lot more. That is a bit different from the fact that following the season, we especially look at the growth of the MTK and MTK guests can see a relatively large increase. This is what we are seeing in this smooth table, we are about $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter last year, and that the gross profit is about 1.1 billion, and that gross profit is about 2.23%. Of course, you can see a slight decrease in gross profit, because it is probably a little lower than the average.

**524. 60-525. 60-527. 60** So last year's fourth quarter. **527. 60-529. 60** Okay. **529. 60-531. 60** This is the part where the combined assets are not. **531. 60-533. 60** This is not a consolidated asset.

**533. 60-535. 60** department store. **535. 60-537. 60** There are several numbers of identical colors. **537. 60-538. 60** You can see. **538. 60-542. 60** The weekly turnover of revenue accounts is slightly compared. **542. 60-547. 60** Our entire department store also saw a slight reduction in revenue. **547. 60-549. 60** The overall revenue accounts are relatively high.

**559. 60-551. 60** This is also the case. **551. 60-551. 60** The number of week shifts you have had in addition to the week shifts. **553. 60-555. 60** I just mentioned that. **555. 60-558. 60** Has already increased the high price part of some wine making. **558. 60-561. 60** The overall week shifts will also go down. **561. 60-5664. ** The ratio of debt is also adjusted down.

**564. 60-571. 60** This is the condition of our dividend distributions over the years. **571. 60-576. 60** Our general distribution rate is about 70 to 80%. **576. 60-580. 60** This year March. **580. 60-584. 60** We will pass this year's distribution rate to 96%. **584. 60-587.

**590. 60-591. 60** 2. 25 **591. 60-593. 60** This is the condition of the distribution this year. **598. 60-603. 60** Let's talk about the specific gravity of our entire group products and applications. **603. 60-607. 60** We are mainly related to Average. **607. 60-609. 60** Fresh and DiREN handicap about 60%. **609. 60-613. 60** I have just had a special reference to AP and PA parts. **613. 60-617. 60** Previously it accounted for less than 20% of the total weight of our products.

**617. 60-618. 60** This year. **618. 60-620. 60** Because last year there were a number of new courses. **620. 60-622. 60** Increase the number of more shipments. **622. 60-626. 60** So for the first time, it exceeded 20% to about 22%. **626. 60-62. 60** Other products include AAC to other products. **629. 60-631. 60** Related products.

**644. 60-646. 60** is the server mobile communication channel. **646. 60-648. 60** and Gaming PC Mobile. **648. 60-650. 60** are the two most important pieces.

**656. 60-659. 60** represents more than 65% of our company. **659. 60-661. 60** is about 70%. **661. 60-666. 60** The Consumer Channel and PG are all generic products. **666. 60-672. 60** I would like to tell you more about the server.

**687. 60-692. 60** This year, the AI Server is really down to 12.3%. **692. 60-696. 60** The AI Server is still a very important part of the product. **696. 60-700. 60**

**700. 60-703. 60** This is what I just mentioned about AP and PA. **703. 60-706. 60** It is mainly used in Mobile and Wi-Fi. **706. 60-708. 60** Also AI and Wi-Fi related. **708. 60-709. 60** Take a look at **709. 60-713. 60** From last year 2023 to 2024. **713. 60** Mobile also has a lot of shipping.

**724. 60-736. 60** This is a part of AP. **724. 60-736. 60** The last one we talked about is **729. 60-731. 60** Because we are mainly e-clouds. **735. 60-738. 60** The memory I just mentioned. **738. 60-740. 60** The MLC memory is also available. **740. 60-743. 60** The AP PA Timing Controller.

**754. 60** There are also some new products for Snyder and Montage. **754. 60** There are some new products for Snyder and Montage. **754. 60-759. 60** will be around some of the more popular products. **759. 60-765. 60** will be around some of the more popular products. **765. 60** will be around some of the more popular products. **765. 60-77. 60** will be around some of the popular products.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-phrase script: The official question is, the official is about 3 to 5%. But in fact, two weeks in the market, there are some things that are actually a lot of ups and downs. I don't think it's just because of the water play problem, because major manufacturers should say that in addition to mobile phones, all resources should be invested in advanced SERVER-related processes, so some new processes will be more advanced DDR5 or HBA moving, so it's indirect because the latter QuadraMix will affect the output of some other consumer types.

So, I think some local manufacturers should get back a lot of market prices, I think I will get more than the official price. Now I feel good to respond. Please tell you, I can just say that we have to experience this inventory in the fourth quarter of last year, so if we look at this trend, can we start to send back some synthesis work? Yes, I just mentioned that the U.S. tariffs, and suddenly it happened, so you see the news, Apple chartered five hundred million mobile phones from India to the U.S., once the tariffs did not stop.

So in fact, in that moment, because we also made the U.S. market, in that moment suddenly the guests call a lot of goods past, so in fact, in the Q2 price of the time, we are also ready, we are also ready, so I just said yes, the second season I think start, because the price of the market and the official price have jumped up, so our overall economy will be very helpful.

But because we're actively de-escalating our stock, it's also an average right. Yes, this can happen later on.

The delivery time of the market, because memory is not a product, there are many kinds of products, I just mentioned is relatively old process, now the delivery time is very long, and even some manufacturers can not confirm the delivery time, you first agree to this value, we will see how to talk about it. So now in some relatively old process this piece, in fact, you talk about the delivery time, the factory also comes out of the normal item, the new process, we will talk to the customer every month, in fact, you only rolling every month, so you say that the delivery can control which part of the market is not a problem, normal thing. D-RAN? I just said that is D-RAN.

If a new customer, or a new customer, or a new brand, we generally have to catch 8-12 weeks, then I don't have a new customer, I can only say that there is a new part of the delivery, which is mainly in China. I don't know if there are more and more products in this period, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I see a lot of products, I can see a lot of products.

We are looking forward to a long-term relationship. Right, do you want to ask for a specific design replay that is about four years old and now? Is it now? Time and time? Time and every month?

Do you not say that there is no fall to the month of January? It should not fall to so much, it should fall to a little, but not to so much, because we know that the current chapter is to increase the price, please ask, a person is able to release naturally, how to speak? What is the release?

Fresh actually has several parts, from the previous example, from North Fresh has already DOL, and then SLC also DOL. Now start MLC, TLC and QLC, it is, there has been a new product coming out, including some so inverted Net recently, recently in the MLC this piece, in fact, the market price has also increased a lot, even to double, because several major payL entry will continue to start MLC, DOL, D-P-O-L lost. Maybe also began not to produce, so the future focus will now be put in QLC to QLC this piece.

In fact, we used to have a lot of applications, and there were a lot of MLC customers outside of the consumer market. It was also recently encountered this problem. So in Fresh, this is a relatively old comparison. In the process of SSD, the price of this piece is much higher. That is not to worry about the high-end part, because it has a lot of new applications. For example, including Server and AI Server, they will use a lot of high-end.

The current move is 8T, 16T, 30T, a lot of storage needs. So in the future in SSD, because of the server, AI Server, we see a lot of demand. That's in the consumption type of this piece, because the entire MLC industry gradually did not do it. Now the price is also the reason, so the market price is also much more.

For example, now we see how the time has changed compared to last year? It wasn't that fast. Yeah, I can only say, I don't know how much time you know? Yes, I can only say, I don't know how much time you know? I don't know.

But the most recent update we've received is this time. It's going to be early? Yes. We're not the same as last year's market last year. So some of the recent guest measures are not so tight, so the market price will rise more. So it's mentioned that it's probably if it's on the move.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
