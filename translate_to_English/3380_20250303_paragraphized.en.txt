The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Faced with media friends, we are very welcome to meet with Mr. Ding Ling and Mr. Mintai Technology Co., Ltd. and Mr. Zhongqi Technology Co., Ltd. First, we would like to introduce the two company's officers. Let us welcome the parents of Mingtai and Zhongqi Technology.

Welcome to the General Manager of the Department of R&D, Mr. Chiu Pui-shun. Next, Mr. Chen Shaolin is the Chief Financial Officer of Zhongqi Technology. Welcome to General Manager Zhou Yangzhi. The agenda for this meeting is divided into three stages.

The first stage is the future goals and outlook of the NCG Group. The second stage is the presentation of the company, which includes the company's 2024 financial reports and the company's product strategy and new market development. The third stage is the company's design phase, which includes the annual financial results and product and market strategy for 2024.

Last but not least, Q&A time. Now we have Mr. Wong, Chairman of Ming Tai and Zhongqi Technology, to explain our future goals and outlook for the NCG Group.

We are here to talk about what we are doing in 2024, and what happened in 2024. Overall, the landscape is restored in 2024. When we talked about this last year, we originally expected the landscape to be restored in the second half of 2024. But in fact, it proved that in 2024, the parts of our customers' inventory adjustment were worse than they imagined.

I'm here to report to you, and I'll share with you what I see now. Again, let's talk about 2025 what we're going to do. So 2024 we talked about one thing we were going to do at the time, which is the division of labor and the pursuit of growth. That's part of the pursuit of growth here is part of the recovery of this market.

So we made adjustments to the organization under this spindle. Overall, it was the beginning of the division of the organization members of the team in Mingtai. Currently, the factory in Zhongzaki has been 100% handed over to Mingtai's factory production. So, myself, Zhongzaki itself is no longer production. And in addition to the R&D personnel who keep the software, the hardware R&D personnel have all been integrated into Mingtai's R&D team.

This is why we have developed a new business in India last year. In July, we set up a branch in India to develop our business in India. So we believe this part will bring some attention to the 2025 group.

We all know that there is a small company called Interactive Technology in the middle of Mingtai. So each year, there is a very stable level of Interactive Technology EPS. In fact, there is a company called Mingtai there is also a company called SIA. So we integrated the company of this SIA into the interactive company. So all these integrations have been completed in 2024.

So, of course, there are some costs involved in the consolidation process. So, this was probably completely digested last year. So I wanted to be an optimisation factor for 2024. Then there was an MMA.

This is what we did in 2024 to report here. What we are going to do in 2025. This we look at in the middle of 2025 and we just mentioned last year's stock digestion is slower than expected. But here is the product line.

The mid-term period last June, and last year, Q3 and Q4, have grown more than the previous quarter. Therefore, some broadband networks have MSOs in this channel, the temperature is clear. So the rest of this non-non-dossus is not so clear that this part of the telecommunications-related part has a switch. But since the end of last year until Q1, we began to notice that there has been a clustering on unspecified models.

So we believe that in this telecom and this part of the switch, the stock should be fully consumed in Q2. This can ensure a definite growth momentum in the second half of this year. This is the judgment we are currently working on. So back to the main strategy we have to do in 2025 is the Data Center AI Data Center.

In this world, we live in a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, a state of grace, and a state of grace.

We're here at AI Data Center. We're talking about more than 800G here. We're also going to start this year. In fact, we're already in development. There's going to be a small amount of shipping this year.

That is, except for this 800G. 1. 6T This is the latest specification of the switch. We are also in this now. The leading group of people. So the whole Mingtai group. This part of the investment this year.

It's here in the Data Center and AI Data Center. It's a very concentrated investment. We have the resources of the entire performers.

And I just mentioned it. The factory integration of Chung Qi has been completed. So we believe in the effectiveness of operation. This increase should be more obvious to see this year.

It is also a new growth energie that has just been mentioned. In addition to this scene, this growth energie that we have created ourselves is from this emerging market in India.

We want to pursue an economic scale. Let's make the whole part of this factory. Just mentioned. Mingtai's factory is now in addition to. Integration. In addition to integration of Zhongqi's production volume.

It also increases the number of Indians here. The whole area is within the business scope of Ming Tai's factory. So we believe in this economic scale. This benefit comes from integration. It is also a big contribution for us this year. So that's the whole Ming Tai.

We worked with the midfielders in 2025. That's all. I'll give a few features to the general manager. Report some details with you. If you have any questions, we'll be able to answer them later. Thank you.

Thank you very much to Mr. Huang. Then we went on a briefing on Ming Tai Technology. We invited Mr. Chan to be the CFO of the company. We did a briefing on the financial situation of the company. Hello everyone.

The combined revenue of that Mingtai 2024 was 214.400 million. That was a decrease of 6.8 billion compared to the previous year. That was about 24%. It was just as the chairman said. It was mainly due to the influence of the big environment.

The bank's rate is relatively slow. That affects the lead in picking up the goods. So making Ming Tai last year's revenue. The results are relatively unsatisfactory. The gross profit margin of our merger remained at 18.3%. That's our operating cost of 3.8 billion.

That was the same as the previous year. There was a savings of about 5,6 billion. It was about 13%. It was mainly because of the decline in revenue. That made our business as good as possible. Last year was 1.6 billion.

That's a 7 billion decrease compared to the previous year. That's the reason why the industry is out of the 4,100 million. Mingtai's two factories in China were integrated. That's why we're dispersing the outside profits of this East Ring plant. That's about 4,5 billion contributions to the outside.

Last year was 2.200 million. That was a decrease of $33 billion compared to the previous year. That was the contribution of the EPA. It was actually $0.400 million.

That's why we still maintain a solid financial structure. That's the strength behind this non-organic growth that we're pursuing. The cash we've raised in 2014 is estimated to have increased by $7.6 billion. That's about 4 billion in cash at the end of the year.

The total amount of our assets is about 23,2,3 billion. Our debt is $9.3 billion. This debt is reduced by 1.2 billion compared to the previous year. That debt ratio was reduced by 4%. Then it came to this 40%.

This continuous renewal stock. So you can see this high from 115 million. There are downslides to the end of the year. QOQ is probably a decrease of about 300 million. However, because of this decline in revenue, the number of days in stock is less ideal.

Last year, the number of QOQ inventory turnovers decreased by 5 days to 150 days. However, if it increased by 16 days compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, this year. Based on product revenue from other sources. This is mainly due to the slowdown in the customer's regionalization of the inventory. This proportion of revenue from our region will be reduced by 9% to 37%.

This product line of the wireless official network. About 5% to 4%. The digital media system's mobile solution is expected to remain at 6%. If you look at the revenue ratio by region, you can see that America still accounts for more than 50% of this. Last year, the Americas increased by 3 percentage points to 57%.

Europe remains at 14%. Asia last year accounted for approximately 28%. The people are also committed to becoming a sustainable company that is inclusive and environmentally friendly. That is why last year we won two awards at the 17th TCSA Taiwan Sustainability Awards.

I would like to share with you the following. Thank you, Mr. Chen, for your support. I would like to invite the general manager of our company to conduct a briefing on the operation and product development of our company. Hello everyone, I am the general manager of our company.

Next, I will report to you. Our product strategy is developed with new markets. Idea. Take a look at the entire industry trend of 2024. The growth of the data center is the biggest in 2024. So we look forward to the future.

The growth of the entire Data Center in 2024. This blueprint is where we can have more products. So we started last year. We are more active to establish that we are leading the way in technology. Especially in the Data Center section. We want to achieve one goal.

That's when we started shipping 400G last year. That's when we started shipping 400G. Now we've started shipping a small amount. But now we're looking at the size of that operation. But now we're looking at the size of that operation. The 400G is a little smaller.

We look forward to this year. There are some issues with the recognition of our customers here. After being able to get a solution, we expect there will be a lot of shipping for 400G this year.

And that's part of the 800G thing. We started last year with a little bit of babysitting. Now we're doing a lot with the needs of our guests here. We're looking forward to 800G here. We're going to be able to get into mass production this year. We just mentioned AI Data Center.

That's because there's a data center in the future.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure there are no omissions or misplacements. For example, the first sentence is the connection between the BC of the GPU, and the next one is a communication between [1084. 00-1090. 00] that requires a faster channel for sharing structure, etc. I need to arrange these sentences in chronological order and merge them into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the integrity of the original sentence. Next, I will pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences to see if there is a natural segmentation point.

For example, [1161. 00-1163. 00] and [1163. 00-1170. 00] are continuous, there is no interval between the two timestamps, so the corresponding sentences should be linked together, but may need to be segmented according to the content. In addition, the user mentioned the section of the "newsletter", including the financial situation and product market strategy, need to be handled separately. The financial part involves revenue, expenses, inventory, etc., and product strategy part involves market growth, new customer development, etc., and these content should be segmented to maintain the independence of each topic. During the process, I will check in a sentence whether there are duplicates or need to adjust the order. For example, [1251.1 00-1253. 00] and [1261. 00-1262. 00] Thank you may have time intervals between these reports and need to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph.

Finally, I will read the whole converted paragraph-by-word text, to ensure that there is no missing any sentences, all the contents are sorted in chronological order, and paragraphs are logical, easy to read. At the same time, check whether the sign and the format are correct, to ensure that the user's requirements are met.

That's why we expect more to happen at the end of this year. So here in Mat Thai we have set up a dedicated team, and then do 1. 6T for some control of the signal, including the entire R&D of the agency including the water cooling part, which is done here. In addition to this, we also have a relationship with Netcom today's big manufacturer blog, where we have a strategic cooperation red card.

This year, we have just launched a new Japanese client in Japan, and this year we have a few of them. So now the entire development phase is very smooth, so we expect to start going abroad by the end of the year. That's what we're going to do in the Big West 4.0 client project, and we're going to start with some of the customers who want to go abroad to the north this month.

That is why we expect that in Q2, the demand for the Japanese market here can start shipping. That was just mentioned by the Chairman, just a new development on this side of our Indian market. We have also completed all the relevant procedures for the development of the Indian market here, which included the production line preparation. So this month we have completely mass production of the aircraft.

Thank you, General Manager, Thank you, Mr. Yu-fa Hui, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-fai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Yu-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-gai, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Yu-ga-gai, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Yu-ga: Mr. Mr. Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Yu-gai, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr.

So in this part of the net profit of business, it is basically a structure that can maintain a profit from the previous year of residence. That net profit before tax is about 200 million2, then the last installment of the female company, is a pure result. The result is, of course, the result is, mainly from a larger scale of the business. That January of the year paid $5.100 million. That is, in this balance sheet, the cash is still used to maintain a relatively high one, so about $23.5 billion.

That's where we just mentioned the change in stock, and in fact, we've been increasing our stock control in the last few quarters, so everyone's stock is a first-quarter trend. So the current weather structure is probably about 143 days. That's all about the control of the entire asset, and it's a simple one to handle. Then, let's ask General Manager Zhou for a brief on the company's product and market strategy.

In the market for this limited-band product, we saw that the demand was gradually coming back, especially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and that even by the fourth quarter of this year, we saw the demand of the limited-band market and this demand, including the customer's renewal of the stock, has been gradually improved. We also saw that we have a gradual growth in our performance compared to those of our new customers. That's when we developed new customers, we at Duxit 4. 0, followed by the Home Gateway of Asha 3. 1, we also have this product development to be leading.

In this part of the integration, just mentioned by the chairman of the 2020 Group for this integration, which actually has a very significant side effect on the restart, so that the restart can be lightened, the whole of the operation of the brand for this product, product planning and development, and the operation of the market can be more focused, so we can have more resources to invest, including pipe and cloud platform to build a stronger core competitiveness.

This is the next three years we will focus on this part of Duxys, investing more resources in the market, as well as product planning, and product development to enhance its occupation. For 2025, in reference to the rising demand for the Cable Modern market, then we continue our advantage, will be able to combine this Wi-Fi7, and then attract more customers and markets.

In addition, in the cloud platform, product planning focuses on Docsis 4. 0 and Docsis 3. 1, in Pong 10G, is about to advance to 2G and 50G, the platform integration with Wi-Fi, the formation of Docsis-based Home Gateway, or Pong-based Home Gateway, and then combine 5G. This way, all product planning, including development under the cloud platform, can form a same management interface, provide the operator, including the cloud platform product planning, through MSO and Telecom, to enhance their service value, and their value services. This is the software development, as well as the resources we want to invest in the next three years.

We are here today to raise your hand, if you have any questions, we will ask the staff to deliver the microphone to you. You don't have to go anywhere, let us come to the root of the economic system production, but Ruskim, iem, we should not need to talk about what todas, we can then V sequel.

Thank you for asking. AI data center, I think this trend is that it may change some extent of the market situation, that is, in the past, may be more clear, will the data center, the enterprise type of the enterprise type, but now seems to be the enterprise as the main focus of the customer, he will also start to have the product nature of the AI data center.

In addition, there is a so-called enterprise-based AI data center, we are so different. So for us, in addition to the company we know in the past, we want to expand the AI data center cooperation, then of course, we also want to go back to this more traditional data center here customers, because I want to grow in demand, a little more suppliers, but also the market is also very good to see. Thank you.

Well, I'm going to answer the question of the factory, and the customer's question should be answered briefly. That's what I'm talking about, and then the trade war, I think it's really been very busy in the past few years, and that's the way it has been since 2018. That's right, so first of all, we've done some consolidation in the factory on this side of the mainland, and I think that's the one.

So for us to think about this question, first of all, I have no way to chase after today, where do I not tax, where do I go, there is no way. So when thinking about this thing, on the one hand, it must be seen that this place is not long-term competitive, even if this tariff problem no longer exists, it has a certain degree of competitiveness. So when going to Vietnam is, compared to this mainland China factory, even if there is no trade problem, at that time, in the cost, Vietnam is also better.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: [2204. 44-2208. 44] The General Manager of the R&D Department knows what we have to do with our hardware. [2208. 44-2210. 44] What do we have to do with our hardware? [2210. 44-2213. 44] There is an internal 85% of our parts. [2213. 44-2215. 44] There are at least two alternatives to this part. [2215. 44-2221. 44] This ensures that our supply chain is free of any impact.

[222.1 44-2227. 44] And one of them must be a part of non-China, because you do not know that other than the place of origin, there will be no control over the internal organs. [2227. 44-2230. 44] Because the place of origin is well transferred, this is one thing we do not know ourselves without rain. [2230. 44-2232. 44] Then again, it is to make good use of EMS. [2232. 44-2236. 44] Because I think we all pay attention to this issue of tariffs every day, it can come and go quickly. [2236. 44-2241. 44] So we are unlikely to build our own factory, so we are now making good use of EMS. [2241. 44-2242. 44] Of course we also have our added value in design, etc.

[2242. 44-2246. 44] These are all our advantages. [2246. 44-2251. 44] Of course we also have our added value in the design and so on. [2251. 44-2253. 44] Our design capabilities are very strong. [2253. 44-2260. 44] So we can provide very good design solutions to our customers. [2256. 44-2260. 44] These are our advantages. [2260. 44] So we are now making good use of EMS.

[2262. 44-2275. 44] Then of course we also have our added value in design, etc. [2265. 44-2268. 44] These are all our advantages. [2268. 44-2270. 44] So we, in fact, are one of our other alternatives. [2270. 44-2272. 44] In other words, if Vietnam is at risk, now we have two alternatives. [2272. 44] One is in India and we have just reported to you. [2274. 44-2277. 44] We have also started our production in India.

[2277. 44-2279. 44] Currently we have two alternatives, one is in India and the other is in the United States. [2279. 44-2280. 44] We are also in the United States. [2280. 44-2282. 44] These are all our backup plans. [2282. 44-2285. 44] These are all our records. [2285. 44-2286. 44] In fact, we are also in the United States. [2286. 44-2289. 44] We are also in the United States.

[2289. 44-2294. 44] These are our records. [2294. 44-2298. 44] These are our records. [2298. 44-2300. 44] The other things we think about, and we are prepared ourselves. [2300. 44-2303. 44] These are our records. [2303. 44-2306. 44] These are our records. [2306. 44-2308. 44] Our parts manufacturers must be close to us.

[2308. 44-2309. 44] Our factory. [2310. 44-2311. 44] But now in such a situation. [2311. 44-2313. 44] We have broken through such thinking. [2313. 44-2316. 44] We have no more to think about whether my supply chain is next to my factory. [2316. 44-2317. 44] It is not a satellite. [2317. 44-2320. 44] This concept of the circumference of the satellite.

[2320. 44-2322. 44] This is no longer the idea. [2322. 44-2324. 44] The current idea is global supply chain. [2324. 44-2327. 44] That is, there are times in your factory here too. [2327. 44-2330. 44] Think about where your board is. [2330. 44-2332. 44] Which is the best? [2332. 44-2334. 44] From the point of view of transportation.

[2334. 44-2336. 44] From its cost perspective. [2336. 44-2338. 44] This is probably similar to an example. [2338. 44-2341. 44] So now we are thinking about how a global supply chain layout is in place. [2341. 44-2334. 44]

[2348. 44-2351. 44] For example, it is high or low in yield. [2351. 44-2354. 44] It is low in cost. [2354. 44-2355. 44] But now the factory has a KPI reduction. [2355. 44-2335. 44] It is the transition that is not fast. [2358. 44-2362. 44] It is the package of your entire design. [2362. 44-2363. 44] These include production tools and so on.

[2363. 44-2375. 44] Is it that you can quickly do the migration. [2365. 44-2367. 44] So I think this is what we are dealing with in this uncertain situation below. [2367. 44-2372. 44] We have our own requirements and supporting measures. [2372. 44-2375. 44] These are all our records. [2375. 44-2378. 44] These are our records. [2378. 44-2382. 44] This is what allows you to do the migration very quickly.

[2389. 44-2393. 44] So I think this is all below our circumstances. [2384. 44-2386. 44] We have our own requirements and supporting measures. [2389. 44-2393. 44] These are all our records. [2389. 44-2393. 44] Thank you for all of the above. [2395. 44-2393. 44]

[2397. 44-2409. 44] We have just mentioned 400G 800G 1. 6G. [2400. 44-2404. 44] Currently the main target customers and markets are in North America. [2404. 44-2409. 44] Japanese customers here with this new customer of our new exhibition. [2409. 44-2409. 44] He is now a corporate-grade customer. [2412. 44-2415. 44] The product demand they present is below 100G.

[2415. 44-2418. 44] That we would like to talk again later about the transformation of Enterprise Core. [2418. 44-2420. 44] This demand. [2420. 44-2422. 44] We began to see more than 100G to 400G. [2422. 44-2425. 44] We are currently in a downward collision. [2425. 44-2427. 44] All chicken-free Lebens. [2427. 44-2432. 44] As for spontaneous And 그��덍

[2432. 44-2434. 44] escavated. [2434. 44-2437. 44] but still. [2437. 44] accept. [2447. 44-2447. 44] accept. [2447. 44-2462. 64] Japan, China, we have about how much revenue we have here. [2462. 64-2466. 74] Then India, if a piece of this is good for MWA this year's revenue?

[2466. 74-2476. 34] Thank you. [2471. 14-2473. 34] That part of the Maori. [2473. 34-2475. 14] I think. [2477. 14-2479. 04] It has several factors. [2477. 04-2484. 54] One of them is of course the factor of the factory and the material here. [2484. 54-2486. 54] The other is the Model Mix.

[2486. 54-2487. 64] Model Mix. [2487. 642494. 24] If the light is from the operational level. [2494. 24-2496. 64] The factory that we are currently working on is consolidated. [2496. 64] Will definitely have a good benefit for our Growth Project here. [2502. 64-2504. 14] But at the same time. [2504. 14-2507. 94] Because we are also developing some emerging markets.

[2517. 14-2517. 54] Of course, we want to be able to think outside of this balance. [2521. 54-2521. 34] The absolute increase in this absolute value of absolute profit. [2528. 04-2529. 04] This is our goal.

[2529. 04-2533. 04] The other problem is this. [2540. 04-2545. 04] Our current market in India has two products that are Secure. [2545. 04-2547. 04] One is MDU and one is IPU. [2547. 54-2551. 04] The FWA is currently being tested and developed. [2551. 04-2556. 04] The future we are still stuck in. [2556. 04-2558. 54] But we expect to be able to move in.

[2558. 54-2560. 54] Start the platform that can be secure. [2560. 54-2561. 54] Thank you. [2561. 54-2563. 54-2564. 54] Thank you. [2564. 54-2565. 54] Thank you. [2565. 54-2566. 54] Thank you.

[2566. 54-257. 54] Thank you. [2567. 54-258. 54] Thank you. [2568. 54-257. 54] Thank you. [2569. 54-257. 54] Thank you. [2570. 54-2571. 54] Thank you. [2571. 54-257. 54] Thank you.

[2572. 54-257. 54] Thank you. [2573. 54-2574. 54] Thank you. [2574. 54-2575. 54] Thank you. [2575. 54-2577. 54] Thank you. [2577. 54-2577. 54] Thank you. [2577. 54-2577. 54] Thank you.

[2578. 54-2581. 54] Thank you. [2579. 54-2581. 04] Thank you. [2581. 04-2581. 54] hai. [2581. 54-258. 54] Thank you. [2582. 54-258. 54] Thank you. [2584. 54-258. 04] Thank you.

[2585. 04-2587. 04] Thank you. [2587. 04-2587. 54] Good. [2587. 54-2606. 54] We can give you some explanations. [2607. 54-2610. 54] Okay, about everyone. [2628. 54-2629. 54] Here are two questions to ask.

[2629. 54-2631. 54] The first thing we have to mention is that we have to pass this production to Ming Tai. [2631. 54-2635. 54] I would like to ask if the capacity of the production here we originally opened up is. [2635. 54-2639. 54] What is next planning. [2639. 54-2640. 54] I remember the words of the United States. [2640. 54-2642. 54] I think the combined capacity in the past year should be more than that of the mainland. [2642. 54-2646. 54] It is not the same as if we had some capacity in Vietnam.

[2646. 54-2649. 54] This part is intended to be applied after this part. [2649. 54-2651. 54] This part is not disclosed at this time. [2651. 54-2656. 54] But I think this group is inside. [2656. 54-2665. 54] Don't have too many factories to merge together must be good. [2658. 54-2664. 54] So it is the first to move people to this place in Ming Tai. [2661. 54-2664. 54]

[2664. 54-2665. 54] [2665. 54-2667. 54] This is the concept. [2667. 54-2670. 54] Then his own factory. [2670. 54-2667. 54] There are several aspects of planning. [2672. 54-2674. 54] Thank you.

Thank you. Then the second I want to ask. Because we should have two more before we can compare. Maybe the revenue is relatively low, but the development is ongoing. That is the part of the 5G dedicated network and the low orbital satellite.

Can't imagine the two of us looking forward to today. 5G dedicated network. This part of the 5G dedicated network. Although slow. But we've seen more and more projects. Because we can from our group.

There is also a SI company that we can see in our business. This practical application case related to 5G has become more and more. That said, we also received a high future repayment last year.

So there has been more and more of this use. So we are still looking forward to the 5G dedicated network. This part is also a continuing investment. I believe this part is the part that should be more and more clear.

"This is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the month, and this is the sabbath of the sabbath of the month.

Before this low-track satellite guests. Low-track satellites are now being reached by many companies. But it was also discovered. There is a growing trend. There is a growing trend. So there is a current one.

Ming Tai is good. It's good. There's still a continuing investment. We've invested in a family two years ago. Rayon Technology. It's also in this low-track satellite supply chain.

We are one of them, and we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them; we are one of them.

I will ask you what you want to do, and you will tell me what you want to do, and I will tell you what you want to do, and I will tell you what you want to do.

Or you can share with your customers. That's the question. The second question is, I just want to get into this AI data center. I want to say that I'm the main customer of these CSVs.

Or do it with other partners. That's when you'll see the fermentation of such a cost. Thank you. I'll answer the first question. The second question is the same, please name it and answer it. Then the factory part.

The first question. We can also ask this to be answered here. The baby is here to talk, because there is an instance here. There is an instance where the customer wants to be born in the baby.

We are now in response to this U.S. government tariff policy. This leads to the fact that there is a corruption of politics and a coalitionist politics. We are in response to the ongoing situation.

We had one of the most important guests of our time. We had him before. We also had one of his related programs. It was in the United States and we had one of ours. We had one last year with this partner. A partner from a factory.

And it came to pass, when he heard this, he brake it, and said unto him, Take, eat: this is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me.

Thank you, everyone. It should have been over a year ago. Biden had sent one. There were hundreds of millions of dollars in this grant.

Then there is a request for the Follow May grant. So it really has a relationship. If it is a fiber-optic product, it must be Baba. By American, build America has such a request. Then we responded to that request.

Working with North America customers. So, North America is ready for an EMS production. So, you must know. The production cost in North America is much higher than the production cost in Vietnam.

So we also have a good communication with our customers. Therefore, in such a case, the cost can be completely transferred. I think most of them can be transferred. Most of them can be transferred.

OK, then the data center is related. The AI Data Center section is currently under control. We are currently in the process of getting involved in the first phase. We are also currently entering. Only this possibility is available to employees.

But that's what we're currently working on. Expected times will be compared to the day after. We expect it to be two or three years later. We're more likely to have a chance. The strategy we're currently working on is to choose. These big Data Center.

We work with some of these software vendors. We want to intervene in this way. But this whole relationship is built around the customer. Some communication. Now it is still there.

We have a place for them, a place for them, a place for them, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, a place for us, a place for them, a place for them, or a place for them.

Thank you very much for your inquiry. Thank you very much for your support. Thank you very much for your support. Thank you very much for your support. Thank you for your continued support. Thank you for your continued support. Thank you for your continued support. Thank you for your continued support. Thank you for your continued support.
