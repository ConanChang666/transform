<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription fragments provided and note that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order, while keeping the original sequence and content of each sentence.

First of all, I will analyze the sentences one by one, to determine which sentences can be combined into paragraphs. For example, the greetings and thanks part at the beginning can be combined into a paragraph. Then the introduction of the participants part, each name and greeting may need to be combined into a separate sentence, but according to the context, may be combined into a smoother paragraph. For example, the introduction and greetings of General Manager Wu Yongmei can be combined into a paragraph.

At the same time, it is important to pay attention to repeated sentences, such as the "thank you" mentioned many times, to keep all instances that cannot be omitted. When processing technical content, such as financial data and market analysis, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the numbers and terms. For example, the index gain and loss and year mentioned must be presented correctly.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps, to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural, not because of time jumps. It is also important to pay attention to the punctuation and format of Chinese, such as using the correct quotation marks, commas, and sentences, to ensure that the separation between paragraphs is clear. At the same time, check whether there are typographical or typographical errors, such as whether the numbers in the timestamps are correct, whether the sentences are complete.

In addition, some sentences may need to determine whether a paragraph belongs to the same paragraph because of the interval between timestamps, for example, when introducing participants, each name and greeting may need to be a separate sentence, but the whole can be combined into an introduction paragraph. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I read the entire paragraph verb, checking whether all the user's requirements are met without deleting anything, keeping the original order, and paragraph divisions in a reasonable format. Make sure that all the timestamps and the corresponding sentences are correct, and that the overall reading is smooth and logically clear.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team of the online conference Diamond Investment and Conference: Mr. Wu Yongmei, Mr. Wu Yanzhen, Vice President of the Investment Department, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Finance Department, Mr. Wu Yuanting, and Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yuanting, Mr. Wu Yongmei, Mr. Wu Yongmei, Mr. Wu Yongmei, Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, Mr.

I am Mr. Ng Wing Mei, General Manager of Diamond Investment. I would like to thank you all for your support. Thank you all all. Thank you for your continued support.

The company's investment strategy and direction for 2025 includes the following four focus areas: in leading innovative flagship investment projects, although the international political situation in 2025 faces the dynamic environment of tariff policies and trade wars, our long-term growth prospects in the biotechnology industry are still full of confidence. The most important goal of 2025 is a forward-looking innovative flagship investment case in the territorial growth environment. The investment strategy will focus on addressing current medical needs gaps, innovative products, especially on the first in class and best in class drugs, and medical devices with high innovation potential. We will also closely monitor international trends, including the changes in the U.S.'s healthcare policy, and increase efforts to find international innovative flagship investment targets.

In addition to leading innovative flagship investment portfolios, the 2025 investment focus will also cover the technology to seek initial efficacy verification, including new drugs and medical devices, as well as those that have entered the commercialization phase, through the progress of strategic steps, we will continue to promote the sustainability of ESG efforts and implement the Responsible Investment Policy. In 2025, we will strengthen the transparency and impact of our investment decisions, and actively engage in dialogue with the investment companies to set corporate carbon reduction targets and implement EFG investment plans.

To promote the setting of corporate carbon reduction targets and the implementation of the EFG investment plan. To enhance the long-term competitiveness of the portfolio. To enhance the long-term competitiveness of the portfolio. To create the company, the invested company and the investor's profit. To create the company, the invested company and the investor's profit.

We are still confident in the long-term growth prospects of the biotechnology industry. From historical data, we have found that biomedical stocks have a relative test and have a relative anti-slip defense effect. The NASDAQ Composite Index fell 39.29% during the web bubble in 2000, but the NASDAQ Upgrade Index has risen to 22.9%.

In addition, during the 2008 financial tsunami, the S&P Market Index fell 39.8%, but the S&P500 Health Care Index fell 25.5%, which was relatively small, while the NASDAQ NBI index fell 12.3%. Therefore, the upgrade medical industry is not affected by the economic cycle due to the stability of healthcare needs, which is what we often say. The upgrade industry generally performs better than the market during market turbulence, with a defense against the decline. Next, let's look at the performance of upgrading medical stocks in the last three months. As the international investment risk continues to increase, according to the OECD report, the global economic growth forecast for 2025 will be revised from 3.3% to 3.1%, while in the second year it will be further revised from 3.3% to 3. 0%, indicating that the US President Trump's tariff policy may further impact the global economy, boost global freight forces and increase market uncertainty.

In the past three months, the S&P500 Healthcare and Nestec NBI indexes have risen by 6.64% and 4.11%, respectively, compared to the broader market. In recent years, the trend of global upgrade-related funds has also shifted to upgrade medical stocks as a safe haven trend, verifying the resistance and long-term investment value of upgrade medical stocks in the uncertain age. We have seen this NESCEC NBI index and the S&P500 long-term price movement from 2016 to 2019, and since 2016, we can see that its growth is very close. But since 2023, we have seen that the S&P500 index has increased by 47.81%, of course, because of AI-related capital dynamics, but Nestec's NBI index has only increased by 5.9%. This shows that the valuation of upgrade medical stocks remains within a reasonable range.

As a result of the impact of international economic and economic conditions and capital markets, Diamond Upgrade Investment has set a high potential target in 2025. Diamond Upgrade Investment has set a high potential target in 2025, leading the innovation of flagship upgrades.

In addition to the innovative flagship upgrade investment case, the company will continue to expand its asset management scale and assist the listed companies of the eligible targets to achieve value in the capital market. Next, we will share the two good news of the company with you. The first is that after the successful inclusion of MSCI Global Small Index constituents in February 2024, the company was once again favored by the FTSE Global Index constituents, which are micro-caps of the FTSE Global Equities Index Series and FTSE Full Market Index. This adjustment has already come into effect on March 24, further enhancing the visibility of the company's international capital market, further enhancing the visibility and influence of the company's international capital markets.

The second good news is that S&P CSA Corporate Sustainability Assessment is one of the most authoritative ESG ratings in the world. Diamond investing is the first to participate in the 2024 assessment, and has emerged from 52 industry 7600 companies around the world, demonstrating outstanding sustainability capabilities. Among them, S&P Global is ranked among the top 6% in the global financial services industry.

In addition, the company has reached the 62-point mark of the yearbook of the S&P Sustainability Yearbook and exceeded the 52-point mark of the Dow Jones DJSI Emerging Markets Index to lay a good foundation for further international visibility. However, the affirmation of the S&P Global assessment is well deserved, but the company will not be satisfied with it. In the future, we will continue to invest in ESG, strengthen the sustainable competitiveness, and create long-term and stable corporate value.

First of all, because of the diamond's industry characteristics, each quarter will first explain how the diamond's revenues are listed. The operating income of the diamond investment mainly comes from the evaluation of the realized and unrealized investment targets. The realized evaluation and loss of profit refers to the difference between the value and the price of the underlying investment. For example, if the book value of an investment target A is 100 pieces in 2024, if the price of the disposal is 120, then the value of the realized evaluation and profit shown on the profit table of the year is $20. The unrealized evaluation and loss is the difference between the outstanding investment target and its no supply value.

Diamond's current portfolio consists of new companies and unlisted companies. New companies and active transactions such as Forever, Donkey, and Star, we use the monthly closing price as the supply value per share. Other companies that do not enter the capital market will evaluate the model in accordance with IFAS. The evaluation method is based on the equity and profitability of each investment subject, and generally we use market law or asset law. Market law is used to evaluate the market multiplier of these peers who are listed in domestic and foreign markets, such as the PB Ratio equity ratio, or if there is an increase in the last year.

This is because the risk of the biotechnology industry is relatively high, so our internal evaluation is based on the principle of conservation. Diamond Biotech's professional team will first perform evaluations internally, and then through an accountant's contract or check. After the completion of our revenue recognition list, let's look at the actual financial situation in Q4 2024 and 2024. According to the revenue recognition rule, the revenue in Q4 of 2024 is negative $6,7674,000, while the cumulative revenue in 2024 is negative 2.2,28791,000. This is mainly due to the actual and unrealistic financial asset evaluation losses.

This section also includes a portion of the commission fee and the relevant securities tax, etc., the amount of this portion is about 16.24 billion. The unrealized loss is caused by a temporary change in the supply value of the new OTC market, mainly due to the new OTC market record and the new drug, the amount is about 60,6 billion. The post-tax loss and the per-share loss are mainly reflected in this just mentioned revenue situation.

On December 31, 2024, cash and monthly cash amounts to approximately $1,622 million, accounting for 1. 18% of the total assets. According to the cost of amortization, it is estimated that the financial assets are approximately 3.1 billion, mainly time deposits with a maturity date of more than three months, accounting for 29. 6. 04% of the total assets.

In 2024, although the share price fluctuations of major investment targets led to negative revenues, the revenue accumulated in January to February 2025 was approximately 1,024 million yuan, and the monthly revenue generated in February was about 409 billion yuan, mainly due to changes in the public value of the new investment targets. These investment targets that are not listed are evaluated in accordance with the evaluation model, and have just mentioned that they are usually using market law, asset law, or special stock evaluation models.

The value of a diamond investment is derived from the cultivation of biotechnology unicorns to create an over-explosive profit, so we value investment development and long-term profitability potential rather than short-term price fluctuations or evaluation changes. The above is a description of the financial part, thank you Mr. Wu.

Next, Vice President Yan-Chen Huang explains to you. The dynamics of biotechnology capital markets. The progress of portfolio operations. And the introduction of investment cases. Vice President Yan-Chen Huang please.

I would like to report to you all. Some of the recent developments in the capital markets are linked to the progress of the operation of the diamond portfolio. This page can be seen. Just mentioned in this quarter. He actually works in the biotechnology industry in the United States. The overall trend goes up.

Regardless of this, the whole size of this. Health industry. BiFarma or Biotech index. This situation in Asia is relatively similar. This.

Tired. The main reason is because of this change in the Japanese market and the mainland China market. That is, for a long time, we are still optimistic about the overall progress. That is to see.

Massera is a company that does what he does with long-lasting G2P1. So, you can see that the capital market is actually very supportive. This weight loss is related to this. This is a development of such a drug that does this health control.

That's it. Massera's this. The company he's done with the long-lasting G2P1 drug that can't go, and he's probably going to hit the drug once a month.

This is the case with the G2P1, which may be a potential side effect, or it may not be resolved, such as a painful side effect.

The second acquisition was also interesting. The company he acquired by Johnson & Johnson. The company Intra Cellular Cerebis. The drug of the central nervous system. It contains drugs for schizophrenia and depression. There is already a drug.

It's already marketed. The drug he may be able to reach Pixel. 4 Billion. That Johnson & Johnson is here. In fact, in addition to many Johnson & Jonnson pharmaceutical companies have some layouts in the central nervous medicine. Because there are also many Almic Cogni in the central nervous system.

That Johnson & Jonnson also has two other drugs for this central nervous system. He has also expired his profession. So also through these. Mergers. To quickly supplement his product. Portfolio That is some of the listings and mergers this season.

The project is shared with you all. It is our own capital market in Taiwan. There was a company listed in the first quarter. The two companies are listed on the TPEx. The two companies are new to the TPEx. It is mainly in medical materials and health care.

That's another new drug. It's a company that does nucleic acid drugs. Enter the new cabinet market. The overall market value is stable. It's not growing. It's also very Healthy.

That's part of the amount raised. Take a look from the plot on the right. Long-term trends. Taiwan's capital market is primarily focused on semiconductor-related industries. The new industry also accounted for the funding in the biomedical industry in the first quarter. Nearly 6%.

It is also an industry class of emanating from a Significant. That is, we also look very optimistic to see this one. The biotechnology industry is one of the capital markets in Taiwan. Development. That is because many of the biotech companies have now.

This very solid operation progress has also made a number of investors. Trust. Back to the European and American markets. The trend of venture capital trading in biotechnology. You can see the past few years. From this.

There is a Peak in the middle of this. Peak of this entire venture trading trend. It happens during this period of the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, this is the case.

This passion is a little retarded before the pandemic, but it is still a stable one. The trend of rising is especially in the past two years. No matter the amount of investment and the case, we can see some new technologies that include artificial intelligence.

Diamonds upgrade our own portfolio. During the quarter, operations progress. Divided into two parts. The left is this. New drug research and follow.
