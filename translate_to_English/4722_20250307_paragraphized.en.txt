<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim content provided. It looks like it is a verbatim of a company presentation that contains multiple timestamps and corresponding sentences.

It should be noted that some sentences may be duplicated, such as [113. 86-114. 86] and [114. 86-118. 86], which are duplicated three times, "In the second half of this year, we have a technology company in Tainan, which may need to retain the original, but may need to merge or adjust the format to avoid repetitive impact of reading.

In addition, the user mentioned "do not delete any sentences" means that even if some sentences look duplicated or incorrect, such as "up borrowed, no!," in the [221. 52-233. 52] section, as well as the subsequent mixed language content, they also need to be retained the same. This may affect the reading experience, but according to the user's request, the original statement must be kept unchanged. In the process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the uniformity of punctuation and formatting. For example, some sentences may be missing a period at the end, or use inconsistent punctuation, but the user's request is not rewritten, so they can only retain the original.

In addition, the format of the timestamp also needs to be consistent and may need to be adjusted to make it clearer. Finally, after the initial draft, I read the entire paragraph verbatim text to check if all the sentences are properly integrated, without omissions or errors. At the same time, make sure that no extra content is added, and convert it exactly to the user's requirements. If there are uncertain places, such as duplication of certain sentences or language errors, it may be necessary to be marked out, but the user does not request to deal with these issues, so just keep it as it is. </think> Below is the result of reordering the paragraph verbatim text according to the text you provide (re all the original sentences, not deleted, rewritten or condens):

The Company shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage arising out of or in connection with the Company's use of, or reproducing, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, or reproducing, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, or the Company's use of, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, or the Company's use of, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, the Company's use of, or the Company's use of, the Services.

The company is a professional synthesis numerical manufacturer, mainly engaged in the production of photochemical materials, electronic chemical materials, non-thin polyester quality, bone materials and other special specializations. The production base currently has two, one is Kaohsiung Yongan plant and Jiangmen plant in Guangdong Province. In the second half of this year, we have an industrial company in Tainan Annan Technology Co., Ltd., in the second half of this year, we have an industrial company in Tainan Annan Technology Co., Ltd., in the second half of this year, we have a company in Tainan Annan Technology Co., which should be in the second half of this year.

As you can see from the diagram, every decade, the company will have a different development. You may see from the diagram, every decade, there will be a different development of the company's development. When the company is just starting to enter the market, mainly the UBR, is a group of illegitimate technical quality. We are very focused on cooperation on the base, so we are working with foreign companies, including American manufacturers Astraland, many technical cooperation. Since the 90s, we continue to introduce other free quality technology, but also with Astraland signed other Foundryism cooperation.

Since the 90s, we have continuously introduced other free quality technology, and also signed other Foundryism cooperation with Astraland. Since 2000, we have entered the era of UV curing. Since 2000, we have been involved in the era of UV curing.

Since 2010, we have expanded the production of UV light curing and expanded the production of 25000 tons of human products in Yong'an District. Since 2010, we have expanded the production of UV light curing and expanded 25000 tons of human products in Yong'an District.

On the electronic material and 4. 5G CCL's basic application It has very good thermal softness control In addition to the application of CCL, it is mainly also used in the gas station casting agent such as cement or latex water-based paint application It is characterized by its market application is very rare, so the market suppliers also let us grasp the market opportunity of such a next page The value of the non-hydrating agent is just Yubi said that it is mainly in the market, such as the yarn marble, buckles, wrong products, these columns are the main application of non-hydrating agent, and the FRB composite materials are lightweight and durable.

[601. 16-605. 16] Because it needs to scale up the economy in the middle and low-end markets, it is beneficial. [605. 16-610. 16] That project has the company's main brick values, acrylic values, and ammonia values. [610. 16-615. 16] These projects will gradually move to China's heating plant. [615. 16-618. 16] These production lines and manpower are here at the Wing On plant. [618. 16-621. 16] It will gradually move to high-magnetization applications. [621. 16-622. 16] Thank you.

[626. 16-634. 16] At the time of the construction of the plant, we had decided not to transfer the technology of light curing values to that place. [634. 16-637. 16] Of course, it is also a part of avoiding the flow of this technology. [637. 16-644. 16] That is why heating plants are mainly based on solvent-type values. [644. 16-650. 16] The main service customers were mainly in mainland market. [650. 16-655. 16] The future of the mainland is also one of the current RCEP members. [655. 16-660. 16] So we will also take advantage of the heating plant.

[660. 16-664. 16] To gradually transfer our orders in Southeast Asia and Australia. [66. 16-667. 16] To warm up the plant as the main production base. [667. 16-668. 16] Next. [671. 16-676. 16] The global company sells more than 50 countries. [676. 16-684. 16] The main UEs are Europe, the United States, and North East Asia. [682.1 16] The output values are based on [682.1 16-684. 16].

[684. 16-685. 16] Because we have a very important advantage. [685. 16-688. 16] Because of the short shelf life. [688. 16-690. 16] He is mainly in Asia. [690. 16-696. 16] Southeast Asia is most likely in Asia and Australia. [696. 16-703. 16] The country that currently crosses more than 50 countries. [703. 16-705. 16] Next.

[710. 16-714. 16] That is the part of the operation for the early days. [714. 16-719. 16] Let's talk to you about last year's operating conditions. [719. 16-722. 16] The last year's operating conditions are basically the same as the original. [722. 16-725. 16] Because the demand for the third quarter started to decline. [729. 16-732. 16] That's why we were more than the original set.

[732. 16-735. 16] The addition to the 20% target has not been met. [735. 16-737. 16] It is after the Olympics. [737. 16-739. 16] It is sufficient for the European market to slay the market. [739. 16-743. 16] It also contains the stock of the customer unknown. [743. 16-748. 16] We currently believe that there is a cycle to enter the next out-of-stock. [748. 16-752. 16] The product value remains flat all year round.

[752. 16-757. 16] The year-round sales are almost the same as in 2023. [757. 16-761. 16] That we think should be the norm of the future. [761. 16-767. 16] Since then, we have maintained such sales. [76. 16-767. 16] The electronic and material are in line with our expectations. [767. 16-770. 16] The year-round revenues are higher than in 2023. [770. 16-772. 16] That.

[772. 16-775. 16] Outlook for operations in 2025. [775. 16-780. 16] The company is under construction in the first half of the year due to the construction of many production lines. [780. 16-782. 16] Includes new production lines. [782. 16-784. 16] The reaction section reacts to detachment and so on. [784. 16-787. 16] There is a certain extent that will affect the production capacity of light curing. [787. 16-790. 16] So before Ann capacity is enabled.

[790. 16-795. 16] We are currently seeing a decline in our revenues. [795. 16-798. 16] If that is the case. [798. 16-800. 16] The current consumer market conditions are relatively low. [800. 16-801. 16] So, we have a relatively strong project. [801. 16-803. 16] The company will successfully complete production line engineering as a priority.

[806. 16-808. 16] The supply is also the same. [808. 16-810. 16] The focus is to ensure that there is a certain principle of supply. [810. 16-818. 16] All construction works are expected to be completed as scheduled. [818. 16-818. 16] The company is prepared for the time it is waiting for market demand reversal. [818. 16-823. 16] Nian An plant is mainly planning the production line of UV. [823. 16-925. 16] After mass production, it is officially put into production.

[825. 16-830. 16] The total capacity of UV light curing reaches more than 50,000. [830. 16-833. 16] It is expected that the test vehicle will be mass production after the third quarter. [833. 16-835. 16] It is expected that the first work will first increase the processing rate. [835. 16-838. 16] Therefore, the general product of UV light curing will be used as the main sales effect. [838. 16-842. 16] Therefore, we can expect the total gross gross profit margin of the company on UV light curing.

[845. 16-847. 16] There may be an impact. [847. 16-850. 16] The current sales of the company UV. [850. 16-854. 16] The proportion of general goods to special goods is about 25 to 75. [854. 16-86. 16] The future will gradually move towards 1 to 1 by a search. [856.1-860. 16] We will wait for the factory to improve the processing rate to the efficiency. [860. 16-863. 16] The quota of the product will be gradually adjusted.

[863. 16-866. 16] and then increase the value of the product as a product target. [866. 16-869. 16] The operating point of that year is mainly in high-speed computing materials. [869. 16-871. 16] is the HC material. [871. 16-874. 16] This is a partnership with J3. [874. 16-877. 16] The first mass production equipment will be completed in the second quarter. [877. 16-879. 16] June will be officially launched.

[879. 16-889. 16] The annual production of its equipment will reach about 450 tonnes. [882. 16-889. 16] The second set of equipment is under construction. [885. 16-887. 16] It is expected to be completed by the end of this year. [887. 16-889. 16] The production of the company's HC will reach about 1350 to 1400 tonnes. [894. 16-897. 16] The rapid increase in the demand for high-speed computing.

[897. 16-901. 16] The CCO manufacturers need to be improved on the demand engine of the new industry. [901. 16-906. 16] So the company will discuss the following expansion plans with J3 in the second half of the year. [906. 16-909. 16] The PHMA production line is also expected to be completed this year. [909. 16-911. 16] This quarter has produced 3000 tons. [911. 16-916. 16] Next year will be one of the major projects in business growth. [911. 16-901. 16] The value of the traditional industry.

[917. 16-919. 16] The company has subsequently transferred the formula to [920. 16-921. 16] Jiangmen plant. [921. 16-925. 16] Therefore, the advantage of the Jiangmen plant RCEP is to supply the Southeast Asian and Australian markets. [925. 16-928. 16] The values passed here will gradually decrease. [928. 16-930. 16] But it will not be immediately. [930. 16-936. 16] The future supply will be mainly used in domestic and northeast Asia.

[936. 16-940. 16

The following is the content of the re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: This page is the consolidated revenue of the major products. The fourth quarter of UV light curing materials has a revenue of $5.3 billion, a decrease of 6% from the fourth quarter of 112. The revenue of 113 million has a growth of 27% from 112. The fourth quarter of electronic chemical materials has a revenue of $9345 million, an increase of 85% from the fourth quarter of 112.

The fourth quarter of the unsaturated polyester quality revenue is $9.5 billion, similar to the fourth quarter of the 112. The fourth quarter of the quality of paint revenue is $7.2 billion, which is 2% higher than the fourth quarter of the 112. The fourth quarter of the quality of paint revenue is $4.7 billion, which is 7% higher than the fourth quarter of the 112.

This is mainly due to the slowdown in demand in the U.S. and Europe. However, the gross profit margin of 113 in the first half of the year is 17.3%, which is a significant increase compared to 112 in the third half of the year.

The gross profit margin will gradually decrease with my own purchase of raw materials. And again, the gross profit margin of unsaturated polyester quality remains around 13% in 113 years, which is reduced from 112 years. Mainly affected by competition. The gross profit margin of the drug value of 113 years, which is roughly the same as 112 years. The next page is the last page of the legal meeting.
