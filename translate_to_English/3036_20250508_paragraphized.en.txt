Overall EPS. The acquisition of Future remains at a relatively high level. On the working capital recovery period part. Revenue days range from 53 days in the fourth quarter to 54 days in the first quarter. Inventory days range from 55 days in the fourth quarter.

There is a relatively large increase to 54 days in the first quarter. This is mainly due to certain product line stocking needs. We expect this to be a short-term phenomenon. In the next two quarters, it will return to normal. But when the number of inventory days increases, you will see payables.

It also corresponds to 66 days from the fourth quarter. Increase to 77 days from the first quarter. So the company's overall working capital recovery period. From 42 days from the fourth quarter, it is actually a further drop to the 41 days of the first quarter.

We should be at that level. It's all good. Then look at the working capital return. ROWC. The first quarter of ROWC was 16. 6%.

Compared to the company's long-term ratio. Or compared to the major industry in the world. They are all maintained at a relatively high level. Net working capital in the first quarter of that year was compared. The revenue ratio remained flat quarter-quarterly. It remained at 0.1%.

That is the annualized return on equity. The first quarter of the ROWC is 10.3%. It is flat with the fourth quarter. From the past few quarters of the trend.

That if we look at ROWC compared to us. The world's main industry. The company is also at a relatively high level. Let's take a look at the financial forecast for the second quarter of 2025. The financial forecast for the second quarter is based on.

1USD vs. 31.2USD exchange rate hypothesis. That's 31.2USD is based on April. Our actual average exchange rate is 32.73. That's as well as we assume in May and June. 1USD vs. $30USD comes from the hypothesis. Based on the hypothesis of this exchange rate.

The median revenue estimate is Taiwan Dollar. $2473.3 Taiwan Dollar is the financial forecast. It is $7.5 billion. Approximately an average increase of 1.6% year-on-year. In the second quarter, the impact of the entire exchange rate is relatively large. If we exclude the impact of exchange rates.

That is to say, look at the dollar numbers. The revenue for the second quarter is the increase in Mid-Single-Digit. There are WP and Future. The second quarter is the growth of the quarter. If the dollar is denominated, let's talk about it today.

It also announced the revenue of April. The revenue of April was NT$1181 billion. It was due to the pace of shipping. The revenue of the second quarter was mostly concentrated in April. Next, we saw Maori.

The median estimated gross profit margin was $113.9 billion. The average gross profit margin was 3.6% year-on-year. The median gross profit margin was 4.6% year-on-year. The average gross profit margin was about 4.6% year-on-year.

The median operating expenses are estimated to be $6.5 billion. The median cost is 2.65 percent. The median operating profit is $48.3 billion. An estimated 6% increase in quarters. An increase of 13% year-on-year.

The reason for that quarter increase was due primarily to Future's operational dry-workout. It continued to improve. The median operating rate was estimated to be 1.95%. It was also estimated to grow during the quarter. Show revenue continued to stabilize.

Gross profit margin is stable. The fee is stable, at least not slippery. The overall business dry draft is driving a rebound. Increases business profit. The median pre-tax profit is estimated to be 38.6 billion yuan. Increases quarterly by 10%.

Growth of 29% year-on-year. Show Future's performance gradually warms up to profit. Further contributions will be made. The median median net profit attributable to the parent company is 27.5 billion yuan. A quarter increase of 1.6% year-on-year. An increase of 28%.

It is important to note then that the estimated tax rate for this quarter is relatively high. Because the second quarter has unallocated taxable relationships. EPS in the second quarter needs to deduct special stock dividends throughout the year. The EPS in the second quarter is estimated to have a median of $2.

The profit-making US stock EPS of the US stock market is $2.45. Next, we ask the chairman to update the market situation and look forward to the part. Hello everyone. Now everyone is particularly concerned about the impact of tariffs.

Only a few passive components and China-made semiconductors are affected. But some are very small. The U.S. exports to China.

And most of the items have been relaxed, so the effect of tariffs is the indirect effect, that is, the customer made goods. Because of the change in demand caused by tariffs.

This part. Main items such as mobile phone PC. etc. etc. 90 days. Therefore, there will be some advance pick-up.

The impact of the second half of the year also needs to be continued. Under the influence of tariffs. Will lead to supply chain transitions. Complexity of trade processes. For dealers like global service capabilities.

We do our best to work with our customers. Find support. Help customers and suppliers. Perfect the global layout. Back to the industry problem. We have a very important design.

Tariff status. Except tariff issues. We actually see a semi-conductive industry. Comprehensive improvement. Mainly reflected in the downstream customer inventory. Adjustments have been substantially completed.

Smart. as well as China's electric vehicle market. Keep up the momentum. And China's electric vehicle market. Increase. Photoelectric level negative resistance value.

In addition, the IPM1 market annual compound growth rate is estimated at 5.3%. In 2028, the IPM1 market size is estimated to reach US$24 billion. The market size of the company will significantly increase from US$5651 to US$1 trillion in the global semiconductor market in 2024 to over US$1 trillion in the global semiconductor market in 2028. According to the application comparison, Garland estimates that applications will grow by 2025, where data centers and markets will grow by 26%, the market server is estimated to grow by 11%, and the industry will grow by 6%.

In the long run, Garland expects a compound annual growth rate of 7.7%, 10.9%, communications 4%, data centers and municipal servers 13.5%, consumer electronics 5.5%, personal computers and peripherals 3.5%, and mobile phones 1.4%. The company will continue to invest in high-growth or high-growth applications such as automotive electronics, industrial, communications, data communications and municipal servers.

In the first quarter, the mobile phone's single-season, and the short-term volatility of automotive and data center shipments, so the application of QoQ growth in industries, communications, PCs, etc., has increased. According to the changes in revenues of other applications, we first look at the QoQ change chart in the top right. This is the company's overall future. The automotive electronics sector has decreased by 14% in the first quarter, with WT down by 20% in the second quarter and Future up by 11% in the fourth quarter. The Asian market has seen strong growth in the past quarters, with a high base period and a high growth of 11% in the fourth quarter, which is the high season and the low season.

The first quarter increase in the industry since 2024 reflects the fact that we have mentioned earlier that stock adjustments have come to an end. The overall demand for the industry continues to grow and continues to improve. Communications business mainly comes from WT, with a 36% increase in low quarters. Communications business has no fixed seasonality, see availability and customer pull rates.

The main revenue of this segment is derived from the WT, which is 9% lower in the low quarter. 20% lower than the quarter mentioned in the previous law, mainly due to fluctuations in shipments between quarters, as with light communication. We are optimistic that AI will continue to grow this year, but there will be fluctuations in shipments between quarters. Consumer electronics and other low quarters overall maintenance quarters increase by 1%.

In addition to the low season, mobile phones mainly come from WT, which is a 27% decline in the low season. Next, we look at the change chart of low-season revenue YYYY at the bottom right of the presentation. This is the WT without Future. According to the application, the increase in automobiles, the decrease in industry 6%, the increase in communications by 44%, the increase in data centers by 2% year, the increase in consumer electronics by 9% year-on-year, and the increase in PC by 15% year-on-year, and the increase in mobile phones by 18% year on year.

The above is my report to you. Thank you to the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer for a presentation. Thank you to the Chairman. Now we are going to ask a question at a stage. If you need a question, write down the name of the company you represent and the question in a window in which you are speaking.

Thank you, Mr. President. Now we have asked Ziel, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, now we have asked Yvonne to answer questions about the question section. First question, investors ask this year's application outlook for the second quarter and year. The outlook for the second quarter has already been mentioned before, and there is expected to be an increase in Mid Single Digit according to the US dollar pricing.

The automotive electronics Asia market is expected to see an increase in the percentage of mid-highs in the second quarter after the fall of the first quarter. Industrial and instrumental industries in Asia have resumed a slight increase in the second quarter, with approximately 10% or more in the second quarter. The demand for optical communication is driven by strong demand for optical communication upgrades, although the first quarter has a significant lengthy process, there is still a 10% increase in the second quarter. Data centers and servers have a decline in revenue in the first quarter are expected to be lower than originally expected, and the percentage of mid-highs is expected to increase in the second quarter.

The second quarter of the phone is still a low season, and revenue is expected to have a digitized percentage of the season. In addition, demand is expected to continue to grow slightly in the second quarter. The overall demand continues to stabilize. Inventory problems in North America have basically ended, and European adjustments have already been announced. As for the second half of the year, there are many variables in the current environment, so the company only offers the outlook for this quarter.

First, investors asked about the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on companies. Semiconductors currently do not include U.S. equivalent tariffs, so only very few IPNE and China-made semiconductors entering and exiting the U.S.

It accounts for less than 1% of the company's total revenue. As a result, the company will find a relatively favorable supply for its customers. In order to reduce the impact of tariffs, there will also be a customer burden if a tariff is required.

The direct impact of tariffs on products. Are there any recent exemptions for some items? The company represents a lot of US-based artisanal products. But the real manufacturing output in the US accounts for very few parts of China. And most of these items are no longer tariffs.

Next, investors ask about the indirect impact of the tariff war. Whether it is to see the customer pull the goods early because of the tariff. Whether it affects the terminal needs. I emphasize again here. The tariff is roughly divided into two levels. One is the part of the part.

Most of the parts have already been removed. Tariffs have already been removed. So the effect of the part duty is actually small. It has an effect on the part of the product. We are talking about the current terminal product.

There are several biggest categories of items. PC phone SERVO such products. Parts of the United States of America. Non-U.S. has no effect on tariffs at all. Out of the U.S. parts. Because of this, there are some early pulls.

However, the color of the second season is mostly a reaction to the semiconductor. The landscape cycle. From the bottom. Gradually rebound. As for how the tariffs will affect the end demand. Because the relevant policies are still changing.

So there is no way to predict it at the moment. The next step is to apply the U.S. tariffs to all countries. There is no response from the customer. Need help migrating the supply chain. How companies plan their warehousing.

With transportation. There is no plan to expand Southeast Asia or India's locations and warehouses in the future. This responds to changes in the supply chain. Because our group has global capabilities, this is basically an advantage for us.

This part is our strength. The company will continue to maintain close contact with customers. That is, if there is a need to adjust. The receiving location of this component.

Because their manufacturing locations are migrating. Companies have a global presence to serve the needs of their customers. Storage and shipping locations expansion. We can do it on existing global platforms. Executing them with customer needs and efficiency. This part will not be our bottleneck.

The next question is to keep up with one thing. He said tariffs caused a big change in supply chain turmoil. Whether the added value of literature as a multinational channel provider would increase. For example, in stock and regional financial management services. Whether the profit of the literature would be better. Currently, the company currently has a global layout.

That's why we've mentioned it a few times before. That's why this trade policy or. Profit politics causes supply chain complexity as well as rapid change. We believe there is a better ability than the past to serve and assist the factory and its customers in making adjustments.

We focus on supporting customers and supporting suppliers to serve them. Help them do their best work. Make the most effective adjustments and arrangements. Further improve the market share of the literature industry worldwide. Next, this is about exchange rates.

What is the risk strategy for a recent surge in Taiwan currency. Whether it will have a significant negative impact on the overall financial situation or the impact on gross profit margin? Thank you. I will answer this. The impact of exchange rate is the focus of attention for everyone in recent years.

So I'm going to talk about this as a whole. The majority of the operating costs for the commercial sector are in US dollars. But the operating costs include a variety of currencies. This includes other currencies such as US dollars and Canadian dollars, so when the Taiwanese dollar rises against the US dollar, it will result in income denominated in US dollars.

The amount of gross profit then corresponds to the amount of business profit. It will all be affected. If you look at gross profit margin and business profit margin, it will be very small.

The effect on the amount of the profit of the business is probably 1%. So we just talked about the financial forecast for the second quarter. In fact, some of the effects of the exchange are already taken into account.

If the asset balance is from a foreign currency, the exchange rate is constantly fluctuating. Then we adjust the hedged part of the money. In fact, we also carry out a certain hedge operation. Therefore, this exchange loss is caused by foreign currency positions.

We do not expect this huge loss to be generated. Investors are asked about it. Recently, China has in the data center infrastructure. Including the cloud and the AGE server. This component is relatively positive. There is no need to observe the relevant requirements for the literary industry.

Which business will benefit. This part is. The mainland China is also actively involved in the parts. Then we are involved. So we will increase part of the revenue with its parts. Next, investors ask about this optical communication-related product.

Are they all in the application of a communications business? The share of revenues that go further with no light communication. Part of the light communication is now in place. Corporate communication divides it into three categories. One is Networking wireless communication. and Telecommunications.

That photovoltaic communication products are all in this category. We don't typically disclose them to specific applications. The following is a question for investors to ask how to estimate the financial costs of 2025. What is the direction of the total change. Net financial costs in the second quarter are estimated to be between 10.5 to 11.5 billion yuan.

This year. Or take a look at the forecast for the whole year. The demand for revenue working capital. If the business grows in the second half. The demand for working capital increases. The financial cost will also increase.

But that's actually positive for the company as a whole. I think that maybe you'll want to pay attention to the fact that this dollar appreciation is the financial cost of the company. The impact of the company's current version will pay attention to the fact that we actually have part of this coin.

So this is not really going to be affected. The impact of the exchange rate. The other thing is that we just mentioned our revenue costs in terms of business. All of these are US dollars, so here we actually use. US dollars borrowing.

This allows the whole of this. There can be a natural avoidance effect. That part of the payment is the interest of the US dollar. So the interest of the US dollar is still us. The interest of the US dollar is, of course, that if the US dollar is converted into a Taiwanese currency, of course there will be a little bit.

This positive effect.

But we don't want to change the way we make US dollars or make Taiwan dollars because we're doing business-related, basically we're going to use the US dollar financing this channel to achieve a natural avoidance. Next, investors ask: Is the dividend distribution rate higher than the previous year will be the new normal? Why is there a value-added proposal to increase the distribution rate for shareholders this year? You'll notice that our most recent dividend distribution rate this year, from the past about 50%, has risen to 70% this year.

The company currently does not have a value-added plan, that is whether there is a need for value-added in the future or to look at the needs of the climate recovery and revenue working capital, then if the business grows, the demand for working capital will increase, profits will increase, and may need to be added. Value-added will usually mean that the opportunity to see better growth in the future. Next, investors asked: The company loses the agency of China ADI, how does it affect revenue and profitability?

ADI's related manpower, in addition to ADI's related manpower, we have transferred to other products, which is relatively poor profit from the company's revenue, basically the impact of the profit from the company is very slight, our other products have been completely covered. Next investors asked: Is the amount of stock increased in the first quarter, because the company is optimistic about the next needs of the company? This is mainly because of the current stock demand, which is a short-term phenomenon, the number of stock and the amount of stock should be back to normal in the next quarter, a quarter or two, but will be more cautious and optimistic, according to the market demand dynamic to adjust the situation.

This is the price of our Lord's trades in U.S. dollars, so the appreciation of our currency will not affect our quotations. If you just said, this change in our currency is very limited to our gross profit margin and operating interest rate. Next, investors ask: will this tariff and trade price accelerate China's semiconductor localization? What are the positive or negative implications for the business of the literary industry and future? The company has a global layout, which is itself a very important market, in fact, we bring a lot of China's local semiconductor products, so if the local occurrence of this domestic replacement for us will not have an impact.

This is where investors ask: What is the effect of this merger and acquisition of future for more than a year? What is the integration status? Our integration progress is very smooth, the two parties and the team are very happy to work together, which is very close. In fact, in addition to the two companies' civil affairs in operation, in fact, the whole team is already together, so next time I do not answer this question, because we are already a team.

In the future, we will continue to improve our shareholders' equity returns in the long run. Investors will also ask the question of tariffs: If the semiconductor chip is subject to tariffs, the product price will generally increase by 10%, the impact on the company's revenue increase, the gross profit unchanged, the gross profit margin unchanged, or the gross profit unchanged, but the gross profit margin decreases? The whole situation of tariffs is constantly changing, the first is that, as the chairman mentioned earlier, the current direct impact on tariffs is very small, so the impact of tariffs in my financial statements is almost insignificant.

In fact, each of our investment channels has its corresponding advantages and disadvantages, including this special stock we have in the past, which in fact has a corresponding clause, including when to redeem and what is the impact of non-reversion on the cost of funds.

In the second quarter of the year, we were talking about the financial costs between 10.5 to 11.5 billion dollars. I think it would be a good idea to look at the situation of climate recovery and working capital needs, as long as the business grows, and increase the financial costs will be a good thing. Well, that's where the questions that the investor has asked and the questions that the investor has previously asked are answered.

If you have any questions, we will email you to the investor's mailbox after the meeting, and we will get back to you after a reply. Today is a great day to thank you for your participation in the investment, this weekend is Mother's Day, so I wish you all a Happy Mother's Day, and today is the end of our law. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
