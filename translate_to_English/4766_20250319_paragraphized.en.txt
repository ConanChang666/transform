<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like a record of a meeting or Q&A session containing multiple questions and answers, each sentence has timestamps.

For example, the first sentence is "[1114. 12-1116.42] why you answer", which looks like a questioner's question. The next sentence is about the effectiveness of the photoelectric field, applied to the optics of the display, etc. I need to sort these sentences logically to form a consistent paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may fall into the same paragraph, for example, the answer to the photoelectric field may have multiple sentences, which need to be merged. At the same time, different questions and answers may require segmentation, such as the dividend policy and the part of carbon fiber outlook.

In the process, I will ensure that the corresponding sentences are placed correctly, and the conversion between paragraphs is natural. For example, when the answer is over, the next question should be replaced with a line or appropriate separator. Also, be aware of spoken expressions, such as "that we are currently in the field of optoelectronics" that may indicate connection and need to retain the tone of the original word. At the same time, some sentences may have to be repeated or paused, such as "thank you for Morrison's explanation" and "thank you Hank explanation", which also need to be retained to maintain the original intention. In the process of financial part, such as dividend policy, it is necessary to ensure that all the mentioned factors are correctly categorized, such as liquidity, balance sheet, capital expenditure, etc., form a complete paragraph of answer.

Finally, questions and answers about the semiconductor industry need to be segmented by technical details and company strategy to make content easier to read, while keeping all technical terms and data accurate. After preliminary finishing, I read the entire paragraph verbatim to check if all sentences are correctly placed, without omissions or misplacements, and to ensure that all the user's requirements, in particular, do not delete anything. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to re-arrange the original data to ensure the accuracy of the conversion.

[1122. 06-1123. 34] The effect is better. [1123. 60-1127. 18] It is mainly applied to optical adhesives on some displays. [1127. 44-1129. 48] For example, in OCA. [1129. 74-1130. 76] or PIN lenses. [1131. 52-1133. 58] Or in protective film. [1134. 08-1135. 12] These are all.

[1135. 42-1137. 20] Imports are replaced. [1137. 98-1141. 04] This is also currently in the process of shipping. [1141. 82-1147. 44] The relative overall insurmountable revenue of Japan looks at the share of these markets. [1147. 96-1149. 24] It is still very small. [1150. 52-1156. 16] This part of the semiconductor industry we have just started. [1156. 40-1157. 94] The glue we produce.

[1158. 46-1160. 76] Made of UV adhesive. [1161. 28-1161. 60] It was very early after the exposure of UV. [1165. 42-1166. 44] It was not sticky. [1167. 20-1168. 48] It would not have any residue. [1168. 74-1171. 82] So it is good for some applications in these processes. [1172. 84-1175. 92] The current application of semiconductors is still very small.

[1176. 16-1176. 94] We. [1177. 20-1179. 76] Continue to push forward some new applications. [1180. 52-1183. 60] The Asian market is already a big one. [1183. 84-1185. 12] The space is just right. [1185. 38-1189. 48] We are currently not very much affected by the layout of our entire strategy. [1190. 24-1194. 86] We are also continuing to care about some developments throughout the semiconductor industry.

[1195. 16-1197. 20] The above description. [1199. 26-1200. 80] Thanks for the Morrison explanation. [1201-1203. 36] The next investor asked. [1204. 12-1206. 68] In 2024, it issued a dividend of $19. [1206. 94-1207. 44] Dividends. [1207 96-1211. 28] The distribution rate of cash shares was up to 85%.

[1212. 32-1213. 08] Please. [1213. 60-1215. 12] Dividend policy considerations. [1215. 38-1216. 66] What are the main factors? [1217. 18-1220. 24] Is it possible to expect such distribution rates in the future? [1221. 78-1224. 08] The financial questions should be answered by Mr. Lin. [1224. 34-1224. 86]

[1225. 16-1225. 68] Good. [1226. 44-1228. 74] Liquidity and maintenance are retained. [1229. 00-1231. 82] Balance sheet stability is the primary consideration. [1232. 58-1236. 16] The current cash flow of Nanbao is stable and stable. [1236. 94-1238. 72] The debt ratio is not high. [1238. 98-1240. 78] is a cash position.

[1241. 28-1244. 62] The capacity of Nanbao is sufficient for utilization. [1244. 88-1246. 92] There is also room for improvement. [1247. 44-1248. 72] Capital expenditure. [1248. 96-1254. 08] Most of it is for customers to cooperate with the investment in close services. [1254. 08-1257. 92] Currently, it is in accordance with the established plan. [1258. 94-1262. 02] and in line with local regulations.

[1262. 28-1264. 58] There is no urgency for the time being. [1265. 08-1267. 90] So capital expenditure is not very stressful. [1268. 42-1270. 46] Also consider. [1270. 72-1272. 76] Long-term ROE level. [1274. 04-1275. 58] Profit accrue. [1275. 84-1277. 64] If that shareholder's equity.

[1278. 14-1280. 20] Increase too quickly and grow. [1280. 44-1283. 52] Maintaining a high ROE will become more and more difficult. [1284. 08-1286. 12] So we will too. [1286. 38-1287. 40] Evaluation. [1287. 66-1289. 20] Moderate utilization. [1289. 96-1292. 78] Adjust the way cash dividends are paid.

[1293. 04-1294. 84] To enhance ROE. [1296. 12-1297. 14] In addition. [1297. 90-1303. 80] will also pay attention to changes in the external environment such as the meteorological industry. [1304. 82-1306. 60] That for the future of the year. [1307. 64-1311. 72] evaluates the profit-performance capital expenditure plan. [1312. 24-13. 78] M&A opportunities, etc.

[1314. 60-1318. 94] But in the case of balance sheet and cash flow health. [1319. 46-1321. 50] will still provide stability. [1322. 02-1323. 56] Cash dividend distribution. [1324. 06-1325. 34] Returns to shareholders. [1325. 86-1327. 40] Thanks for the explanation above. [1329. 96-1331. 24] Thanks Hank for the explanation.

[1332. 26-1334. 82] The next investor asked if I wanted to ask. [1335. 58-1336. 36] The company at. [1336. 86-1339. 42] What is the outlook on carbon fiber. [1340. 44-1342. 50] I answered this well. [1343. 00-1344. 04] In terms of carbon fiber. [1344. 34-1345. 62] The field of application is currently being developed.

[1346. 12-1346. 90] Included cars. [1347. 16-1348. 94] Refurbished vehicles. [1349. 20-1349. 96] Snow palm car. [1350. 48-1351. 50] Mobile phone. [1352. 52-1353. 30] Mouse. [1353. 80-1354. 84] Laptop.

[1356. 36-1357. 40] This is a big project. [1357. 64-1360. 72] Our Q1 has begun to have one. [1361. 24-1366. 36] The mouse and laptop have been shipped and then the mouse and laptop have a new customer talk. [1366. 60-1369. 16] We hope that Q3 Q4 has a new volume. [1369. 94-1370. 70] Then. [1370. 96-1371. 48] Existing.

[1371. 72-1374. 04] The amount of electricity in Q2 will not continue to increase. [1374. 34-1375. 88] Because there are some small learning curve problems. [1376.1 90-1380. 74] The car is modified and there is a new car we want in season 3. [1381. 24-1382. 28] Starts. [1382. 52-1383. 80] relatively large shipments. [1385. 08-1385. 60] So.

[1385. 86-1386. 62] Overall, there will be relatively high costs and performance in the second half of the year. [1386. 88-1390. 20] Thank you. [1391. 48-1392. 00] Thank you. [1396. 10-1398. 40] Thanks to the CEO's explanation. [1398. 92-1402. 76] Another previous investor asked the question. [1403. 00-1404. 04] The current market.

[1404. 34-1405. 62] began to worry about technology. [1405. 88-1408. 18] and the semiconductor industry's outlook. [1408. 44-1414. 58] even with a relatively conservative view of inflation expectations and consumer confidence. [141414. 84-1416. 12] That's the question of Nanbao. [1416. 62-1417. 90] This kind of view. [1418. 42-1420. 20] What are the comments?

[1420. 46-1422. 76] and what to do in the future. [1424. 04-1424. 56] Good. [1425. 08-1431. 22] I would like to take a look at the company's historical data in different economic cycles. [1431. 48-1434. 04] Anti-volatility is relatively stable. [1434. 34-1437. 40] In the past, our revenues were only in major global events. [1438. 18-1440. 22] For example, the 2018 financial crisis.

[1440. 74-1442. 78] COVID-19 in 2020. [1443. 30-1446. 36] There is a slight negative growth. [1446. 88-1450. 46] The Fed has been steadily growing for the past 60 years. [1450. 98-1453. 80] This is mainly from our diverse application market and portfolio. [1454. 30-1456. 86] We do not over-reliance on single industry or customer. [1457. 12-1459. 94]

[1460. 44-1461. 48] So I think. [1462. 50-1463. 00] Ours. [1463. 00-1464. 04] Customers. [1464. 30-1466. 08] Geographical areas are scattered. [1466. 60-1468. 14] Comparisons are not affected by a single event. [1468. 40-1469. 92] The words that affect are also less.

[1470. 44-1473. 26] We will continue to optimize our product portfolio and diversity layout. [1473. 76-1476. 58] Based on new growth opportunities and reduced single industry. [1477. 10-1477. 60] Impact. [1478. 38-1481. 44] Over the years we have also actively promoted our Maori product portfolio. [1481 70-1482. 98] Optimize the product structure. [1483. 24-1485. 80]

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcription: [1593. 72-1595. 52] Do not be contaminated or destroyed, these processes actually have a lot of applications with glue. [1595. 78-1598. 58] We also continue to cooperate with customers to develop new applications. [1599. 10-1602. 18] The above explanation. [1602. 68-1604. 48] To develop new applications. [1604. 98-1606. 02] The above explanation.

[1618. 82-1610. 88] Thank you for the description of Morris. [1611. 90-1613. 18] The second investor asked. [1613. 44-1618. 30] The fourth quarter's operating profit margin was 16.4%, with a record high. [1618. 82-1620. 86] The question was whether there was any further room for improvement in 2025. [1621. 38-1625. 72] The question was whether there was any further room for improvement in 2025. [1626. 50-1629. 56] That was the main driver.

[1630. 08-1630. 84] Probably. [1631. 62-1633. 66] Okay, this is what we got Hank to answer. [1633. 92-1635. 70] Good thank you. [1638. 26-1639. 30] Operating profit margins. [1639. 54-1641. 08] There is still room for further improvement. [1641 34-1641. 86] There is room for further improvement.

[1642. 10-1643. 14] Further space improvement. [1643. 40-1643. 90] space. [1672. 32-1673. 10] that part. [1673. 40-1674. 42] is not in our full control. [1674. 94-1675. 96] However, you can refer to the presentation on the 12th page of the chart. [1678. 00-1680. 06] The 12th page of the presentation can see the net operating rate is somewhat inverse to the trend of raw materials.

[1680. 56-1681. 58] You can see that the net operating interest rate is somewhat inverse to the trend of raw materials. [1682. 10-1684. 14] The net operating interest rate is somewhat inverse to the trend of raw materials. [1684. 66-1685. 94] The trend of raw materials. [1686. 20-1687. 74] The trend of raw materials is somewhat inverse. [1688. 24-1692. 08] In the past, our operating profit margin was barely more than 10%. [1692. 34-1694. 90] But now we have maintained more than 10% in eight consecutive quarters.

[1695. 16-1696. 70] Gross profit margins also fluctuate between different intervals. [1697. 46-1709. 54] Gross profit margins also fluctuate between different intervals. [1701. 56-1703. 10] This reflects the physical constitution of our operations. [1703. 40-1704. 42] The physical constitution of our operations. [1704. 94-1706. 22] There are significant improvements. [1706. 98-1709. 28] Even if the market environment fluctuates.

[1709. 80-1711. 58] We are still able to maintain the profitability of five pieces. [1711. 84-1713. 12] Five pieces of profitability. [1714. 14-1716. 70] That outlook is 2025. [1716. 96-1719. 02] We will continue to focus on enhancing our portfolio. [1719. 26-1720. 80] Enhance our portfolio. [1721. 58-1723. 36] Expand our gross profit business.

[1723. 62-1725. 16] Optimise operational efficiency. [1725. 66-1729. 26] also flexibly respond to changes in the market. [1729. 50-1730. 28] To ensure stable operating profit margins. [1730. 78-1732. 84] and further increase in opportunity. [1733. 40-1736. 22] and further increase in opportunity. [1736. 46-1738. 26]

[1740. 06-1740. 56] Good. [1740. 82-1742. 62] Thanks for Hank's explanation. [1743. 90-1745. 42] The next investor asked if the supply of Nanbao products would be affected by U.S. tariffs. [1745. 68-1749. 52] The impact of U.S. tariffs. [1749. 78-1750. 30] How do our production bases adapt and respond to relevant measures?

[1753. 62-1775. 72] How are our production bases adapting and responding to relevant measures. [1758. 74-1759. 76] Because we did not export directly to the United States. [1763. 14-1764. 94] Because we did not export directly to the United States. [1766. 22-1768. 26] There is no direct export to the United States. [1768. 52-1771. 08] There is little that does not affect the entire revenue. [1771. 34-1771. 84] Revenue.

[1772. 36-1775. 42] Other key is our customers. [1776. 20-1778. 50] Our customers. [1779. 78-1781. 82] Our customers. [1782. 08-1785. 66] We will cooperate with their customers to reduce their tariffs. [1786. 44-1778. 72] Main production bases. [1788. 22-1791. 04] Shoe color or related cameras have relative layouts.

[1791. 82-1873. 10] We should be in line with the market changes to adjust should not be a big shock. [1801. 58-1802. 36] Thank you. [1802. 86-1804. 66] Thank you for a good explanation. [1805. 18-1807. 48] Next on-site investor ask the question. [1808. 24-1814. 38] Looking for optical glue and UV glue market around. [1814. 64-1815. 16] Thank you.

[1816. 44-1817. 46] Wayson can estimate it. [1818. 22-1818. 74] Estimate it. [1819. 00-1819. 76] Estimate it. [1820. 28-1821. 30] Thank you very much. [1821. 56-1823. 10] Because the market is constantly changing. [1823. 40-1824. 16] Change.

[1824. 42-1825. 18] The level of this application is also more and more us. [1825. 44-1828. 26] The level of the application is also more and more us. [1828. 78-1832. 62] Some emerging applications are also developing. [1833. 38-1837. 22] Look at the size of the entire market. [1837. 48-1841. 58] The optical glue with this rough estimate we may see in the range of the white billion. [1842. 08-1844. 38] The range of the white billion.

[1844. 64-1847. 72] The scope of the dollar may be different. [1848. 22-1850. 54] Also make different applications. [1851. 30-1852. 84] May follow. [1853. 40-1855. 18] We have been looking forward to seeing this market change. [1855. 44-1856. 46] Changes in the market. [1856. 72-1858. 26] This is glue.

[1865. 42-1866. 96] In different directions. [1865. 48-1868. 50] Direction. [1870. 54-1859. 60] If you are in a range of glue, it is probably more if you become a tape person. [1872. 86-1876. 44] If you become a tape person, there is more.

[1877. 20-1878. 22] So this is a different range. [1878. 74-1879. 76] Different ranges. [1881. 04-1882. 06] This range. [1882. 32-1883. 10] May be slightly different on the data. [1890. 30-1891. 08] Good. [1894. 14-1897. 48] Thanks for the answer and explanation.

[1898. 24-1899. 78] The next investor asked. [1900. 30-1903. 10] The international oil price has recently dropped. [1903. 36-1905. 66] Do we still have room for growth in gross profit margins in the first quarter? [1906. 44-1908. 74] This is Hank's answer. [1911. 04-1912. 84] This is Hank's answer. [1913. 14-1913. 66] Good.

[1913. 90-1916. 22] This question continued to fall because of the current oil price. [1916. 72-1923. 38] The oil price continued to fall because I observed that the oil price is generally a range of shocks. [1924. 14-1926. 46] It is a range of shocks. [1926. 96-1927. 98] I think that Nanbao raw materials and oil prices are only a reference. [1928. 24-1932. 86] Nanbao raw materials and oil prices are only a reference. [1933. 36-1939. 50] So our raw materials are sometimes linked to oil.

[1939. 76-1942. 84] About 20% of oil-based products. [1943. 14-1944. 94] So the gross profit margin for the first quarter was not very high than the oil I felt. [1945. 18-1947. 74] The gross profit margin for the first quarter was not very high. [1948. 52-1950. 30] The oil I felt that the correlation was not high. [1950. 56-1952. 62] The current situation in the first quarter seems to be good. [1956. 96-1959. 02] The first quarter currently has a good announcement.

[1959. 26-1960. 30] The first quarter is now through February. [1961. 06-1962. 34] The first quarter is currently through February. [1962. 60-1963. 62] The first quarter is currently through February. [1963. 88-1966. 70] The first quarter is currently through February. [1967. 46-1969. 26] The first quarter is currently through February. [1970. 02-1970. 54] The first quarter is currently through February.

[1970. 78-197.2. 84] The performance of profit is also quite healthy. [1973. 14-1976. 22] The performance of profit is also quite healthy. [1976. 46-1979. 28] YY is still growing so the condition of the entire buttonline is healthy. [1979. 80-1980. 82] But it is healthy. [1981. 08-1982. 86] The condition of buttonline is healthy. [1983. 38-1984. 40] It is healthy.

[1985. 18-1986. 20] It is only healthy. [1986. 46-1986. 96] This is how it is. [1990. 30-1991. 82] Thanks Hank for the explanation. [1992. 60-1994. 64] The next investor asked the question. [1994. 90-1999. 00] What do you think of the raw material price in the next half-year to one year? [2002. 06-2003. 10] Hank can tell.

[2003. 40-2011. 08] Because it has just been stated that the fluctuations in raw materials are actually difficult for us to fully control. [2011. 84-2017. 98] That is, if you ask a person's opinion is actually a stable raw material price. [2018. 76-2024. 38] The future of my opinion is stable because a lot of factors such as the current supply of raw materials are many, etc. [2024. 64-2026. 94] raw material supply is still a lot. [2027. 98-2028. 74] But. [2029. 00-2030. 02] Such.

[2032. 06-2033. 10] I think this is because it is difficult to have complete control of a subject. [2033. 40-2033. 90] A subject that is difficult to have complete control of. [2034. 16-2037. 24] It is difficult to have complete control of a subject. [2038. 26-2040. 30] For personal view, it should be basically stable. [2040. 56-2042. 10] is basically stable. [2042. 36-2043. 12] Thank you.

[2045. 94-2047. 22] Thanks for Hank's answer. [2047. 48-2047. 98] Answer. [2048. 24-2052. 60] Next investor asked is a substitute for the import of adhesives for semiconductors. [2052. 86-2055. 16] mainly to replace the counterparts. [2056. 18-2059. 26] What are the main reasons why the client is willing to adopt it. [2059. 76-2062. 84] This is mainly used in mature or advanced processes.

[2063. 14-2064. 94] or advanced processes. [2066. 22-2067. 74] I think you understand the explanation. [2068. 00-2069. 28] Thank you. [2070. 06-2075. 18] The main import replacement is certainly some of the major suppliers of Japanese-style systems such as Tora Lintech are well-known in the industry. [2075. 42-2076. 20] is well-known in the industry. [2076. 46-2080. 04] is well-known in the industry.

[2080. 54-2082. 60] That's why customers can be willing to replace or choose to use mainly because we are the import replacement. [2092. 06-2093. 10] One of the localization is the import replacement. [2093. 14-2095. 70] It is also easier to understand some of the requirements of local customers. [2096. 22-2099. 54] Some of the requirements of local customers. [2099. 80-2100. 82] Some of the requirements of local customers. [210. 84-210. 12] We can customize the direction of some parameters or some of the applications they request.

[2115. 16-2117. 72] The different operating conditions include tension or extension force or the different operating conditions. [2110. 80-2112. 60] The different operating conditions. [2113. 10-2114. 64] The different operating conditions. [2115. 16-2117. 72] The different operating conditions. [2119. 00-2121. 56] The different operating conditions. [2122. 06-2122. 84] We.

Yes, you can. The parameters we control are comparable. The comparison is directly in our direction. I stand with the customer. The adjustment speed is also faster. The simple service should be better.

The part of the object is to look at the customer's opposites, direction, one.

Customer. The service meets the requirements of customer. Above description. Thanks for Morris' explanation. Next investor asks what is the company's raw material inventory policy. Pengen can answer.

The current raw material inventory policy of the company is probably going to be. It is a principle to prepare according to the order. Of course, we sourcing strategy. The units will determine that some raw materials are relatively possible.

I have to go up from the bottom of the country. Go. I may have a little more material at this time. This magnitude will not be too much control over the extra half-months to a month. Because raw materials will still have some safety considerations and space considerations, so it won't be too much.

This is the current policy of the Group. Thank you very much for the explanation of Hank. The next investor asks is the company's one-quarter operating fee. It is now about 10,6 billion yuan.

The cost rate is up to 17. 23%. To control a long-term goal of 15%. It seems impossible this year.

That's the question I answered. That is, last year's operating fee rate was 17.1. We will try to control some of the operating fee rate every year. Of course, we also have to pursue.

The increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years, the increase in the number of years.

The current practice is to control each quarter at about 1 billion yuan, this year it seems to be quite the same, and we will try to do it.

This year's rate is expected to be lower than last year's rate, in addition to the mid-range cost.

This is how revenue increases compared to last year. Because revenue increases. Some of the costs associated with this increase in absolute amounts. For example, shipping costs.

Thank you very much. Thanks for Hank's explanation. Next investor question is EQ25. Dalian Chemical Cash. Encourage distribution.

How much is the total amount? Well, I answered this question. I haven't received it yet. Dalian is a publicly issued company.

A friend of mine is actually a friend of mine. I can do one. There are some references to the public information. There are some related announcements. Nan Bao holds Dalian.

100 billion. That was in the past in general. In the past few years, there are some relatively less general. That in general. Dalian's cash encourages about. About us.

The other income contribution is generally 4000 to 70 million. But like last year, he allocated 100 million yuan. That was two years ago. Divided to 3 to 4 million.

In the first half of the year, the EPS is more than 4, the previous year was more than 4.

So it is possible to wait until the end of March. He will appear when he actually allocates it. The first quarter of Nanbao's earnings report. Thank you for the explanation above. Thank you Hank for explaining. The next investor asks about the capital expenditure this year.

Planning is all about how. Egan can do it. Well, this year's capital expenditure is due to last year's. There are already some plans to delay this year. It is expected that this year will be around $11 billion.

It is now in China, Vietnam, and India. There are plans for new capital expenditures, but plans will go through many years.

Thanks for the explanation. Thanks for Hank's explanation. The next investor question is: Semiconductor glue is mainly used in mature or advanced processes. Or packaged.

OK. That might explain a little bit. Mainly our current. Semiconductor adhesives are used in mature processes. Advanced processes and packaging processes are some of them in testing.

That's another application. In fact, it's still developing some. The new process improves so this customer. There are a number of requirements. For example, some have to be resistant to high temperature.

Or. Rally. Change this much lower requirement. The above description. Thanks for Morris' explanation. The next investor asks is.

The next Gen innovation strategy has been around for some time now. Have you asked for the latest updates? I'd like to ask for that again. Jeffrey Morris. Let's talk about it. I'd like to talk about it first.

Well, that's what I've been going through. Because we're also communicating with these big customers. The so-called Next Generation means he's in the future. What to do next. We're going to do with him. Some products in the next stage.

For example, what I just mentioned is that, for example, that. It's a lot of force. It used to be from two kilograms. Then it could turn into 15g after UV. We could do lower in the future.

For example. 4g or a number. Continue to optimize this process. Some requirements with customers. There are a lot of new applications that continue to ferment. This is.

Next Generation. Some applications of semiconductors. There are also some applications of woodworking, such as what we are doing now. It is also possible. Liquid PUR is 100% solid.

But it is liquid. Good operation. Also good for the study of some wood with high humidity.

This is also a very good product. This is also a local application. This is our next generation of woodworking applications. The shoes are the same as Morrison here. The next Gen is the same as the brand's performance of some of the shoes. What is the need of this part of the product? Of course, we are the next Gen working together with the brand to continue this strategy and cooperate with their high-performance products. We also provide the same kind of thanks to the next two explanations. The next investor may ask the management to understand how OK I think the core business extension includes the application of the industry or the expansion of the raw materials, or the expansion of the region or the extension of the core system.
