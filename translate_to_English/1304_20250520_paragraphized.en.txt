Hello, I would like to invite you to participate in the Taiwan Aggregate Chemicals Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture of Asia Aggregate Co., Ltd., to introduce you to the management team today.

Thank you very much for reporting on the company's earnings and financial situation. Thank you very much. Thank you all for your interest in the company, the media, and the online and on-site guests, ladies and gentlemen. So let's start today's Aggregate legal meeting. Let's take a look.

Caps. soybean. his wow. mom. reckless.

The sound. By one application. bearing. Our presentation outline today is divided into four parts.

First of all, I am going to report the company's product introduction, as well as the operational overview and outlook. Then the third part will be reported by our quick manager Zhang. After the report is over, our general manager will host the Q&A.

The first company introduction and product introduction. As of April 30th, the number of employees of the company is 2.3 billion. The first quarter of the combined turnover is 15.34 million. The same period last year, compared to the same period.

The main products we produce are LDP and EVA. Our LDP products are mainly used in LDP applications in the relatively high-end parts. Here you can see some of them containing medical devices.

Another more important application is food packaging. Domestically there is also a library called talent packaging. Even it contains a library of coffee cups that we are going to drink at supermarkets. There are some electronic packaging as well as unused products. Packaging containing cosmetic products. This part is a strength of our products.

Use in some packaging that compares some of the more effective products. The requirements are relatively high. It is also the direction we have been working on for years. So here we look at our sales in the first quarter reached more than 11000 tonnes.

Packaging film containing EVA solar energy. Then EVA's special product application. Including our library of TSMC. We also have more traditional foaming materials. And the wire computer section.

The second part is the overview of the operation and the outlook. First, let's take a look at the upstream raw materials. Our upstream raw materials are vinyl and crude oil. The first part of the crude oil is because it actually rises to a high point in mid-January, about the 15th of January when it rises in the first quarter of this year.

In addition, OPEC has already mentioned some of the information, probably in March, April, or even May, that they not only plan to reduce production, but also plan to increase production. The reason for this is that the price has started to decline significantly since mid-January. You can see the blue line in this chart, and the purple part is vinyl. The vinyl part is relatively strong in January and February. There are two main reasons: the first is some petrochemical plants in mainland China, and it has some new production capacity.

However, the new production capacity has been completed, but the upstream part has not been completed. So in order to test the operation of the pilot, they had to go to the market to buy ethylene. So in January and February, the second reason is because there were some petrochemical plants in Korea that were shut down in January and February. So in March, the part of the price was stronger.

So, in the first quarter of the year, the price of the whole January is basically going up. We can see the three parts in the chart. The green line above is the rich EVA, the blue line is the high EVA content, and the orange line is the normal 14% to 20% of the foam level EVA.

So it's basically flat in January and February. Then there's a slight drop after March, but the drop isn't too big. Then we'll take a look at the text description section. Then the operation of LDP in the first quarter, because there's a major petrochemical plant in the mainland, it produces a graphic LDP. So its current news is that it's in the second quarter and probably will stop production after the end of the month. So that's why it's also the main supplier of LDP in the continental picture level, so we expect LDP to be out of stock.

So in the first quarter, the import market it once rose to more than $1450. This is just the strength of the product. So in the first quarter, we have to fight for such opportunities. Adjust the combination of our products. So to increase the production volume of LDP.

So the sales of LDP in the first quarter increased by about 40% compared to the same period last year. Then you may be concerned that our products will not be affected by this U.S. tariff policy. Then the LDP part is mainly the domestic sales. So the export part is actually the part of China, the main application is whether I just mentioned coffee cups or some uncolored goods.

The first quarter was a rebound, mainly due to the excessive look-out in the market last quarter last year. In fact, the first quarter was a large-scale application in the EVA market. It was supposed to be its low season. However, because it was over-looked in the fourth quarter, the manufacturer, which included the manufacturer of the rubber film with solar power, was very low in inventory.

So it actually continued to do the repositories in the first quarter. However, because everyone's inventory is relatively small or low, so in the first quarter, their buy and sell repositories were still pushing up the EVA market.

That's because the price of EVA is rising, so the gross profit margin for EVA in the first quarter of this year compared to last year is a significant improvement. In that case, our production line is basically as much as possible in addition to the necessary reductions, and then the sales are not too big. That's why we continue to expand the market of EVA in the second quarter. That's the strength of EVA in our company, which is not too much of the manufacturer that can be produced in the Asian region, and the technical difficulty of this product is relatively high, which is one of the direction we are going to develop in the future.

In the first quarter, the sales volume of EVA decreased by 14% from the same period last year. We looked at the first quarter of that year's sales figure, the sales volume of 34000 tonnes, which is almost the same as last year's, but the sales volume of the sales portfolio was quite different. Mainly the sales volume of LDP increased significantly, the sales volume of EVA was significantly reduced, the sales volume of EVA in the second quarter was 10124 tonnes, and the sales volume of EVA in the second quarter was also increased by hundreds of tonnes compared to the first quarter of the year.

In the last five years, the sales changes in the first quarter may look like the first quarter of this year's sales volume in the first quarter. We look at the second quarter and the outlook behind this business, we first look at this point in view, the parallel tariffs in the U.S. have been suspended for 90 days, and there is a better outcome in the U.S.-China trade war. The recent past is also relatively slow, but since OPEC here will continue to increase production in May, so our view is that there will be pressure on supply demand in the second quarter.

So we can expect the price of vinyl to remain relatively low margins at this time. The VM part, mostly because there is a new production capacity, and the other quarter there are more vendors tax breaks, so now it is almost over, and it is expected that the entire supply will be loose in the second quarter. We look at the impact of PE and EV on the market, including the sub-specific part, which is actually less than 1%, but its biggest impact is because of the uncertainty of the market.

In the first quarter, we also saw a lot of photovoltaic operators who would try to produce the pre-installation before this, and the tide of photovoltaic is coming to the end of this time. In addition, the new city's photovoltaic operators in the production capacity at the end of this month, the Chinese red well has a set of 200,000 tons of production capacity at the end of the first quarter, and there is a set of 200,000 tons of people expected to be production at the end of the first quarter until the end of the next month.

In the future, if we say that the main supplier of this petrochemical plant in mainland China cannot recover, it may be a niche for us. The other side of the Tufu, because he has a higher technology ratio, so we have an advantage in this area, so we will continue to expand Tufu's market share in January.

This is the direction we continue to expand. Then we report financial information by the manager of our finance department. We also have beautiful girlfriends. Then I report to you. This is the first quarter of the company's consolidated financial information. Here is the consolidated tax rate table.

The consolidated revenue for the first quarter of that year was 15.34 million. It was about 27 million less than the same period last year. This change was mainly due to a 3% decrease in sales in the first quarter of this year. The price portion of that year was probably 2% higher than last year's average price.

So the average total amount of sales is about 27 million less than the same period last year. The gross profit margin for the first quarter of this year was 100,002 million.

Gross profit margin is 7%. That's about 94 million more than the previous year's gross profit margin. This affects a 2% increase in the overall average price, in addition to what was just mentioned. The average raw material price has also dropped by about 2%.

That's another part of the operating expenses. The operating expenses for the first quarter of this year are $65 million. That's about four million more than the first quarter of last year. The gross profit for the first quarter is $102 million.

The net operating interest rate is 2%. However, the expenditures from outside of the business are $2.6 billion. The $2.6 billion is mainly derived from the loss of the transfer of investment in the stock. After that, the expenditures from outside of the business.

The post-tax manager lost 273 million in the first quarter. That was estimated at 59.4 billion. The loss per share in the first quarter was 0.4 pieces of money. Then take a look at the financial ratio. The first quarter of that year just mentioned that the sales manager was 36 million. So the operating profit rate was 2%.

The net loss at the time of deducting out-of-office expenses was 15%. The ratio of the third debt to war assets. Because of the increase in the overall borrowings in the last year, the overall ratio was 11 at the end of 2023. That increased to 16 at the end of last year. That was also 16 at the end of the first quarter.

The first quarter of the flow ratio was 279. The speed ratio was 203. It was slightly smaller than the previous year. There was a slight decrease at the end of last year. The average yield was 30. The average downtrend was 41.

This is my report. Thank you. Let's take a look at the first quarter. The merger is 121.47 billion.

That is relative to the same period last year. Some added. This is part of the merger. That is actually the same part of the industry. It is probably more than last year.

This is the whole group of this trend. In general, the company of individuals is probably the same, a small gap, although the turnover is very little, but there is a slight inside.

It's not the same as last year. It's ours. This year's turnover is in line with last year's sales. We're over 2200 tonnes. That's over 2200 tonnes.

But the price is decreasing. The price is decreasing this year. But there are also differences in rates. The rate for the first quarter of this year. We averaged about 32.9. Of course, it was different now.

But in the first quarter. The US dollar is relatively high for Taiwan dollar. That year's first quarter rate was 32.9. That last year only 31.4. That's the impact of such a crossover. That's almost the same turnover.

We have seen that the Lord is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have seen that He is with us; we have heard that He is with us; we have heard that He is with you.

The so-called high pressure law, plus our low pressure law, part of the PE.

Another part of CBC. It's less volume. I'm not going to talk about it today. Let's take a look at the portion of production. Production capacity is the same as capacity. No change.

That portion of the production. Compared to last year, there was a significant increase. That is to say, it is mainly during the first quarter.

That's just part of the first run. It's also mentioned that EVA's business is good. The price of photovoltaic is also better. So, in the first quarter of this year, in addition to the necessary repairs, we are almost full.

That is a capacity of 50,000 tonnes. If we speak of EVA, we have an average of 10,000 months. That is to say, a quarter should be three thousand. That is, if it is the first quarter of this year.

This opening rate has reached about 90,000 tonnes. There are 7 percent. That is relative to the same period last year.

EVA performance compared to last year. The volume is better. But the price is. Let's introduce it. The price is relatively low compared to last year. Let's take a look at another factory.

This low pressure method is the same as the lower part. Look at the output. That output. This year's output is 22637 tons.

That was relative to the same period last year. We increased a lot. That was the same period last year mainly at this time. The relationship between oil tax gaps in the first quarter was too much for him. That said, we were in the same period last year.

Only 11000 tonnes. That 11000 tonnes. If we look at the capacity of 130,000 tonnes. This time last year. The first quarter was only 3 out of 5. Then it was this time of year.

Seventy-nine percent of what we have done in the past year is the same as the one we have in the past year.

We will continue to look at this piece. Well, let's take a look at this section of Westgate crude oil. Here is the part of the dwelling.

剛剛在亞居的時候已經有說明過了，那我們這邊直接看一下這個產量的部分，可以看一下後面這個最右邊這個金鍊的部分，可以看了很明顯，原油的部分下面這個藍色的，那原油今年是有一個大幅度的比較下跌，那主要就是經濟問題不好，還有川普這種關稅這種問題，就造成今年，那去年的話最高都要將近高點的時候到90，那去年基本上是爲止在70到80%的高點，那今年的話，那從這個七八十的時候就下來，瞬間的時候到59，那前期到第一季末的時候，幾乎就剩下60塊62塊，那最近就是稍微再往上到五月之後到65塊左右，基本上今年的油價就是會比去年會來的低，來的低這會造成說，這個以西的我們的成本也會降低，那如果如果這邊來看，如果看這個紫色的一系的部分，看得出來，如果跟去年同期低機來比的話，我們今年的一系在第一季耗用的成本相對去年同期是減了44塊美金，每頓44塊美金，這個是對於我們今天那是比較相對去年是比較有利，那預估後面的一系也會爲止在比較跟去年比起來比較低點，好，大概800塊在上下左右，這樣對我們是是蠻有幫助的，那這一塊等一下還會在於以西的部分，那對我們後面有什麼樣的影響，我們等下再做進一步的說明，好，我們看一下EVA，那EVA這個趨勢，那上面兩條是高VA跟低VA的EVA的趨勢，那下面是成本，是那個紫色的是以西，我們也看過了，那下面的是MEM，另外EVA裏面的VAM這個成本，那臺聚基本上是都做高VA，所以我們把那低VA的干擾掉之後，我們可以看得出來今年的第一季，那基本上他第一季價格是往上升，這個在亞聚的部分，我們也有說明過了，那但是這邊是要跟去年來比，如果跟去年來比的話，我們這個我們先看，預計，我們臺聚賣出去的EVA跟去年賣出去的EVA，大概一噸是下跌了97美金，這是在我們的售價的部分，那下面這兩條剛纔在紫色的這以西，我們剛纔說明第一季我們耗用大概減了44塊，每噸44塊美金，這是在以西，那44塊相對EVA的跌5 97塊來講，是不夠，但是這個MEM，耗用我們EVA裏面，臺聚大概佔30%是沒有，這個裏面就跌了121塊，比EVA的跌幅是來的大，那這樣一個結果加上我們的銷售量，那整個結果事實上，整個我們EVA跟去年同期比起來是，雖然結果是有稍微比去年的虧損大一點，但是隻要的虧損還是在於，碳稅也是開始增收了，那因爲這個多的這種虧損大不了多少，但是碳稅的部分就喫掉一部分，所以大概如果以整個結果來來看，包含美金匯率的影響等等的話，事實上EV A的虧損弧度是跟去年是差不多的，好，那我們再看一下PE，那PE我們也是主要是看今年第一季跟去年的比較，那紫色以西，其他兩個是產品，那臺聚賣的是比較高端的，這個是算是Young HD Young，這個高價格比較高的，那事實上臺聚賣的裏面又算是比較精品，那事實上會比這個國際行情這個設出的Young，比這個Young Grade會來的高一點，所以我們的spread事實上是比這個會稍微大一點，但是趨勢我們可以來看，就是說低季跟去年低季比起來，這個spread是有增加的，是有增加，雖然售價是跌了21塊左右，但是PE的跌幅大概是21塊，但是美金的匯率的影響，反而換算成臺幣的時候，21塊美金的這種差額，在換算成臺幣的時候，我們一公斤大概反而是賺了一塊錢，所以今年事實上我們PE的表現，相對去年是來的好，所以我們的PE的表現，剛剛講到EVA的部分，比去年同期，整個包括銷售量，包括價格，包括匯率的影響，比去年的虧損稍微多一點，但是這個就由我們PE這邊的獲利cover起來，所以事實上如果PE加EVA之後，我們兩個加起來，事實上是比去年少虧一點，少虧了一些，基本上這樣的趨勢PE，我們講PE的部分，我們講PE的部分就好 ，那到第一季的時候，我們今天小虧了，大概只有600萬左右，那去年同期大概虧了1900多萬，這個幅度就已經縮小，那如果你看這個乙烯的趨勢，後面是有跌的那麼大，那PE的跌幅是小於，小於這個乙烯的跌幅，所以到第四月的時候，那現在就五月，四月結束了，四月的賺的錢，就比我們第一季虧的錢來的多，所以事實上我們如果，講PE這部分的話，到四月份的時候，我們已經在PE的場，這個是已經有小賺一點，那後面當然惠利是比較不利的，比較不利，因爲臺幣這個升值的太多了，那我們看一下銷售量，銷售量在今天第一季的時候，54萬，那個54000多噸，54000多噸，那比去年同期是好一些，但是這個如果跟往年比起來的話，2023 2024還不是我們最好的時候，往前在2021的時候，我們如果兩個場EVAP都好的時候，可以達到27萬多，還有一些代工的量，那今天是比去年好一點，但事實上這個都不是，在這幾年內不算是很好的量，好，那我們看一下跟去年同期，我們剛纔講了，就是差異大概增加了2200噸，2200噸裏面EVA大概增加了500多噸，其他的就是PE增加的量，那我們看一下一到三月的回顧，那EVA的部分，那剛剛亞軍已經說明了，我們臺區亞軍一樣。

In the first quarter of that year, almost everything was full of production. It was sold smoothly. On the side of EVA, and on the other hand, in the light lake, India set up an anti-dumping on the surface of the mainland light lake. So we also, in Southeast Asia, even in India, also increased sales.

We jump directly to the fourth point, so if we see the light lake, we already have half of that light lake. Last year, it was about one hundred percent the same time. In addition to the impact of U.S. tariffs, the high-end brand shoe factory, and the special cable demand was hit. This is why in the previous few legal fairs, we gathered and even aggregated in this one more special. These are relatively profitable.

Fortunately, the recent U.S.-China negotiations have slowed down and compared to a positive direction. So, when we these customers, these high-quality customers, who sell their inventory, should slowly return to normal after June. In the PE review, if the impact on the U.S. tariffs on the situation, Taiwan's PE is based on domestic sales, and the export portion, we are not directly sold to the U.S., so the impact of tariffs is relatively small.

In addition, in this part of PE, we also gave back to the Western electricity market. So in Q1, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, or the same period last year, we are a better development. In addition, by the Sino-US trade relations, we are in the export side, some of these customers, he will turn to us to buy. So, in this aspect of PE, so in the first quarter, we, in the period of domestic sales, we have a big one.

In addition, PE, LDP is small, mainly suboperators, mainly suboperators, mainly service. Some of the old customers of the group, they identify the products of the group, and the brand of suboperators, this is a small number. Suboperator service customers, we look at this demand, in the demand of EVA, the photovoltaic industry accounted for more than half of the population. This year, we look at this year's one estimate, conservative, one estimate very conservative. The new installation volume is 530 to 580, which last year has reached 530.

This is my personal opinion, for example, last year our estimate, about 390 to 430, the result is 530. That is, it should be the same this year, because at the beginning of the year, the entire economic environment is not good, the demand is not too good, and we should not be too optimistic about it. So we look at the demand of the mainland, the demand of the mainland, the expectation of the optimistic estimate of about 580, the outcome of the latter may be a little more than this, will come.

So the whole demand fell, but his self-sufficiency rate with his capacity increased. From the same time last year, 63,000 tonnes, until the same time this year he had reached the production capacity of 671,67,1,000 tonnes, that self-sufficiency rate has reached 83 today, there will also be added capacity, added capacity, added capacity, this EVA, China EVA application, this last quarter of the conservative assembly, about two months ago, and then we just put it in, so that the first season of the conservatorship, without a friend, you can refer to it again.

The demand in mainland China is high. So the support rate in the future will be higher and higher. Then there will be three red wells behind it. Then just the runner mentioned that they were probably in the second quarter, probably this month.

They have a new capacity of 200,000 tonnes. Then there is another in Korea, which is expected to produce around June. Then we look at the operation of the second quarter, and the operating outlook. Then the first oil field, where there is also a description. So basically this year's oil price, last year's forecast was about 70 to 80 oscillations.

So, compared to last year, it is relatively low and relatively low. So this is for the back, we look at the vinyl. So, now, it is about 780 790. So, compared to the same time last year, it is much lower than the same time last year. So, this has a lot of operating space for us, that is, the cost is reduced.

Then, in June, when we were drafted, we said that this draft only had 10,000 tons, and then we could turn into 40 thousand tons of this operating space. Then there was this low-priced vinyl, at the right time, we could buy in. So when we bought a lot of it, that we just talked about, PE, this factory, is a small profit and loss, such a different point. If there is such a more flexible, this kind of vinyl can be arranged, that this operation is very helpful for us in the second half of the year.

So basically, the mid-tidal wave of light and martial arts is about to reach the end. The supply of EVA is increasing, so we want to achieve, there may be some sales areas that have to be adjusted. Then in the first quarter in Southeast Asia, India has a good layout and progress. Then these are to be planned early.

So the second point is that the US-China trade, although the midway is cool, but just mentioned earlier, the initial word suddenly, the impact of US-China trade. So it is temporarily, without placing an order with us, to sort out its stock. Then the trade war will be relatively positive, as long as they digest it, then confront us, there will be a lot of help. So in addition to this, the US-China trade, under the influence of the trade war, there is another thing we benefit from, that is, some of the special EVAs we are developing, some of which are based on US imports.

So they came to us to buy these relatively high-quality, these EVAs. So before we were going to go to the market like this, it was harder for them to get used to you, because they didn't need to change. But now, the trade war is slowing down, and tariffs from the U.S. to China have been reduced, but they're afraid. So there's also a second source.

So in the future, we are in the P1 part, that is, if we can increase the working rate, increase the driving power, we are the second plant, P1 part is the opportunity, the opportunity this year can also be profitable. That is, we, P1 the plant has the opportunity, today can break the previous years, like our small losses, the opportunity to make money. Then EVA looks like this year's situation, can only be said to minimize this loss, because in fact, it is very competitive.

So in the West, we have this new appearance of the Intercontinental Terminal, which can be arranged, which is a big help to us for the cost of the later part. Then that's my explanation. Well, that's my part. Good afternoon ahead, then report to the Taiwanese company, then report to the Taiwanese company, and then the consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2025. Then we first see the merger, in the combined sales revenue, the first quarter of 2025 was, 121.5 billion, then the same period last year increased by 1.2.5 billion.

So sales revenues increased over the same period last year, mainly because of mergers, cohorts, and Delta's sales volume increased over the same period last year. As a result, the combined revenues increased.

That increase is 200 million. This is mainly due to the relationship between the product portfolio, so the cost of goods sales increased over the same period last year. Sales gross profit was $400 million, which decreased by 90 million compared to the same period last year. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in sales by the combined subsidiary Huaxia, so sales gross profit decreased.

The cost of sales management is $9,100 million, increased over the same period last year, mainly due to the increase in the sales of mergers and acquisitions, the cost of sales management is increased. R & D costs 1.2.8 billion, the total cost of sales before mergers and acquisitions is $600 million, the net operating interest rate is 5%, compared to the same period last year losses of 2 percentages. Then the expenditures of the industry have 4 million, and the external expenditure of 10 billion, mainly because the mergers of subsidiaries and Xuteng companies in accordance with the equity law, 50% of investment losses, the total investment losses of 10.76 billion, which belongs to the total investment losses of Taikoo absorption recognition, 3.600 million, which belongs to the merger subsidiary A. The following is a look at the combined financial ratio analysis, then look at the consolidated financial ratio analysis for the first quarter of 2025, the combined operating rate of negative 5%, that 13 percent, that is, the loss is mainly because of the reduction in the margin of the combined company products, the other industry also recognized the loss of investment in the company's investment, so the loss, the asset ratio 41%, that is slightly increased from the end of the year, that is mainly because the net value of the Taiwan region continued to lose, so the balance ratio of the balance ratio is slightly increased from the end of the year to the year, compared to the previous year is slightly reduced, that is mainly because the merger company used to invest in fixed assets, so the flow rate and velocity ratio is slightly reduced compared to the previous year, the average of 45 days, that is the average consumption of 54 days, and the previous year is largely maintained, that is the most, and that is the company is the company is the first of the financial report of the financial report of the first quarter of the company.

In fact, the main influence is this uncertainty, because our customers, their customers, the outlook for the future of the economy behind this outlook, the whole supply chain, the price of buying has been affected. So in fact, at the beginning of April, our orders were obviously feeling a contraction situation, and then later this U.S.-China negotiations were much better than expected. So on that day, I regret that the next day the market situation had a more obvious improvement, but I personally felt that the tariffs had not been completely restored.

I don't know if there are any other questions on the field or on-site investment advanced or media friends. Well, thank you. The investment advanced questions and the operation team's supplementary explanation, please ask the field and the on-site investment advanced questions to discuss. The general manager with that two questions, the first is that the solar panel after being hit by high tariffs, and then the second half of this year or later, the strength of China's financial subsidized solar power generation will not be the whole if looking back at China's solar installation is high or YY or a percentage has passed.

謝謝。 我先回答股雷相關的問題，然後另外一個問題關於光伏太陽能產地的問題我再請柯明處長回答。 股雷的部分第一個先談它的駕動率第一季股雷的駕動率大概是稍微低於八成第二季的展望是稍微高於八成所以就是在八成的上下變動大陸同類型的裝置就是買輕油然後進裂解爐然後裂解爲下游的產品大體上這個狀況都還沒改善。 那股雷自己能做的就是它有一些降本增力的專案他們現在正在進行，那這個就是怎麼樣去把下游的產品再做優化同時呢對這個原理原料的部分也儘量找多來源希望能夠在更多的來源的原料上面取得一些成本上的改善。 所以總的來說它有一系列的這些降本增效的專案正在進行當中。 那有關於剛剛投資先進提問的這個大陸太陽能的部分還有就是海外美國對於東南亞課稅的這個問題，那首先我們可能分三個方面來看，從中國的情況剛剛其實也提到太陽能的需求這個的展望其實是中國光伏協會提出來的，那以過去的經驗來看的話實際的裝計量其實都是高於預估量。

That's why we're looking at the long-term outlook for solar energy. So we can see from this point of view that the first quarter of the year is likely to be high, but not the whole year high. So if this is the case, it's likely that in June or even July, the demand for China in photovoltaic might be a little weaker, but it may be reversible later.

As for the part of the overseas industry, we are also concerned about China's construction plants in order to avoid the previous two years, the U.S. double opposition to mainland China, so there are factories in Vietnam in Thailand here in Indonesia. Then the whole of these overseas plants.

This is the reason why we need to be able to sell solar panels to the U.S., and we need to be able to sell the film directly to the U.S. because of our customers' feedback. However, how many of these are because it is the U.S. research on photovoltaic, it is limited to building solar panels and solar cells, for the film, it is not limited, that is, if our customers sell the film directly to the U.S., it is not a problem. Another thing is that India, because it is really good for this policy, so we just mention that we have to say that the layout of EVA at the photovoltaic level is actually very early to notice this, and that the current supply of photovoltaic-level EVA is mainly three areas in supply, that mainland China and Taiwan has a little bit of Thailand in the past, but most of these three areas, which are outside China.
