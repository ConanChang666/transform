The following is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs: We are very happy, and thank you very much. Today, we are going to take part in the spring forum of our painting content business. Today, we are going to perform a third session with you. Before that, I would like to introduce the chairman of our company, Mr. Li Chongyi, the first chairman of our company today, and thank you very much for your applause. Thank you very much, our second vice president, Mr. Wu Changsong Wu, and thank you for his arrival.

We don't have much time to say, we're not much time to talk, we're just beginning to talk, we're having a lot of time to talk, we're having trouble with the time, please ask your colleagues to go ahead and talk about the results of the whole revenue of 2024 this year, Mr. colleagues will talk to you at the same time, 2025 our company's view, so if there are any problems in the process, please feel free to look at it, so we start today's meeting. Good for you guys, I'm the financial director of the west, Mr. Cheng Peiqing, for you to explain the financial statements and changes in the overview.

In the fourth quarter, our main production in Malaysia is the exchange rate of MYR, so the exchange rate of MYR is still large for the market, so the previous quarter will be said to have a special effect on the previous third quarter, our third quarter is a 4% increase in the exchange rate of MYR, while the fourth quarter is a 5% increase in the exchange rate, so the exchange rate in the exchange rate will have some adverse effect on the cost, but overall because we just said that there are three relevant factors to the exchange rate, so the cost of manufacturing is still a significant impact. So see the fourth quarter's gross profit revenue is reduced by a little more than the cost of manufacturing, so my sales gross profit is to 38%, compared to the previous quarter 36% growth, in the operating fee is close to 1.7 billion, compared to the previous quarter is a slight decrease, which has a decrease in the cost of personnel reward. 7 billion, compared with the previous year's 2.4 billion is the growth of 53%, the sales change is a large part or the part of the polishing, the color polishing the whole last year sales in good condition, the sales of the shipment amount more than twice the previous year's, that part of the sale is mainly last year's polishing in the first half of the customer demand and our polishing capacity to come up, so in the first half of the first half of the year there are relatively more polishing shipping. The second half of the second half is more than repair, so the color polishing is a little slower than in 2023 is 20%, and then 2020 here is 30%, so the color polishing is a more growth part, that in the production part, 2024 production is a three percent increase in 2023, the overall in the size of the economic effect of my manufacturing cost is still effectively reduced, so my operating gross profit is to 39%, 39%, compared to 36% is 36% growth.

In the part of the operating expenses is $600,600 million, compared with the previous year is an increase of 1.1 million, which is mainly because of the increase in profits, the personnel reward and salary will be increased, and in the last year our subsidiary in Japan has to use a Korean women's espac, that is, to push a new brand of AI, that is, the sale of blood-absorbing gun, that part is now sold in Don Quixote, its nails is a continuous sales, so because we have to ask the well-known Korean women's group to speak, so the advertising cost is more. In the last year we also in China, we started to use our own refrare brand, there is online sales, so the overall advertising spending is increased compared to the previous year, the more is also hope to increase the popularity of our brand, and the focus on the development of some of eye preparations, and the other things in the last year also put in contact contact contact lens, we hope that we can do follow, we can be able to other new products, we can be able to other health related products, and other products to be able to other health related products.

Business interest rates rose to 22%. The revenue portion of the out-of-office expenditure was an expenditure of 50 million, which was an increase of 14 million compared to the previous year, which was mainly the relationship between the depreciation of the Japanese yen. The revenue from the revenue generated was that the tax was 110 million in 2024, and the consolidated tax rate of this part was 14%. The current set-up was owned by the parent company is 63.600 million, with 10.10 per share, which is more than twice as much as the previous year 4.79.

This decrease is mainly due to the decline in consumption in China, which affects the Chinese region, and Taiwan receives sales in China. Taiwan and China have a share of 3.3% of sales in raising, which is the main reason for our sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The region in Europe and in the Asia region, compared to the previous year, because the fourth quarter is relatively new shipments, so the revenue is slightly reduced. The region's sales in the United States is 2.3 billion, the sales in Europe is 9400 million, the third quarter is 68 million, this part is 4 percent growth, compared to the fourth quarter last quarter of the fourth quarter of the year, so the growth in the United States is 7 percent, so the growth in the United States is very good, because the customer in the sales in the first three quarter is not good, it is solid growth.

The second part is the presbyopia multifocal, there is to go to the European market, in the third quarter, the presbyopia multifocal, as the age begins to grow may be more than 40 years old will be some presbyopia problem, then presbyopia multifocal as the age begins to grow up can be more than 40 years old will be the problem, then the presbyopia multifocal is as long as the age begins to grow, so this product can also go to Europe as the age of wearing contact lenses.

In the part of the inventory, at the end of last year, is the part of the 5197 million pieces, has fallen to less than 6 billion, that part of our inventory weekly rate, from four months to three months, is a relatively healthy level. The other part of the financial assets in the non-traditional part, there is a 26500 million at the end of last year, using equity method investment, here at the end of 2020, there is a 42500 million, which is mainly for Mingda medical investment, we have reached 20% of his investment at the end of November, so changed to equity method investment.

The Malaysian Ringgit exchange rate was the biggest in the third quarter and the third quarter was up 12%, and the fourth quarter was down 5%, so it has been relatively slow. The Malaysian local economic situation, so it may be that the exchange rate is relatively strong, but the overall has been slowed by the fourth quarter. The above is the whole financial report has been opened, and we are now conducting Q&A, so if we have advanced investment in the future, please raise your hand if you have any questions.

Then I sent the microphone to you. Thank you. Here are three questions to ask. The first is our company's idea of this year's interest rate, because the last spell mentioned that we have a chance to come back.

This is the first one on the market, and the second is that we have added capacity in the fourth quarter of this year.

And the third said, "Behold, we have seen the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the gold, and the silver, and the gold, and the gold,

There is no such thing as a positive impact or a big impact. Then another is to ask what kind of investment we are investing in. The University of Hong Kong is a person who wants to produce what kind of vertical.

For the first point of gross profit margin can be seen just. Last year, this year, the whole situation of the new high in revenue. The production of the momentum is actually the cost. The decline is much more so the gross profit is obvious. Progress. That year.

Q1 has been around for a while and we've seen it this year, we've seen it, we've seen it, we've seen it, we've seen it, we've seen it, we've seen it, we've seen it.

That's how we grow. That's why the second question is how much capacity expansion will increase. In fact, we did some in the second half of last year. The optimization of the old production line did not spend too much money on the equipment.

Production efficiency has increased by about 10%. We had it before. Production capacity was 38 million pieces. Last year we had 20 million pieces. That's what I'm talking about right now.

There are new ones. Equipment orders are coming out this year. The fourth quarter production capacity will open to 4600. That's probably what we're going to do this year.

This is what the client needs. Ready. So that growth rate can probably be thought of here. That is, of course, under the scale of the economy, we are actually human right now.

So the whole collection. I believe that gross interest rates must go back. It is more forward here to develop. That is, the part of Mingda or ask. The chairman of the board came here. Tell you about that part of Mingda, and we actually raise it because we are from.

In this part of the eye. That is, the long-term development of the breeding is that we want to invest in the health of the eye. Professional. Ophthalmology health group. So you can see that we just heard that we are in fact in addition to contact lenses.

The white ring is a human being or eye drops, which is already inside of us. It is invested in research and development. Of course, we are talking about raising this piece of us or the technology-oriented company we do not say to go to the outside to buy to sell.

This is why I developed an investment technology. That's why. Contact lens eye drops. Then again, if you have a problem with your glasses, the first thing you do is to do a test. So the test instrument is also a very important part of our eye.

Professional company. The company's revenue break rate is also stable in all aspects of the equipment is also very advanced in the market. So about two or three years ago we had the opportunity to start.

That's what Laborate is all about. I think everyone's combined will be a little bit bigger. That's what our gross profit margin was just saying from 3800 to 4200.

Capital expenditure is very little because we only slightly improve the line. The amount of capital expenditure is from 4200 to 4600, which is really a further extension. 4 million pieces are to be limited. That is, no matter how we are efficient from 3800 to 4200, this will contribute to our gross profit margin.

So I think we're going to talk about it this year. Going back to the 10 percent gross profit margin this year should be. It should be high. I'd like to ask two questions. First, I want to ask what we're talking about this year.

The second is that there is nothing we can share with us this year. Thanks for that. Well, first of all, I'm going to start from here. In the US, after we started talking about last year's high revenue. Almost every region's revenue is.

There is a little difference between China and China. The US here is actually a better year-over-year growth rate then the main thing. The old customer did some marketing activities. The sales growth is expected to be better than he expected. So the US there is.

We have a few. Old customers have sold some. New items. It's back to Europe. Last year's revenue was also very high and so far the momentum of growth has stabilized.

This is what we saw last year. Multifocal, the aging film, looks at the market's customer-driven situation. So America and the United States seem to be stable, but it is growing steadily. China and Taiwan are in fact our customers in Taiwan.

Sixty-seven percent of chips are sold to China, so the entire market looks like China. We are now. Growth is relatively slow. Last year. China. Revenue is basically the same as the previous year.

This year, we're going to see how much we've grown, but we've grown, and we've grown, and we've grown.

That's us, that's us.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to make sure that the user doesn't delete, rewrite, or consolidate any original text. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to pay special attention to this. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like a record of a meeting or Q&A session, containing multiple timestamps and corresponding speech content.

For example, [1425. 48-1427. 28] The spherical plane and [1427. 28-1430. 10] after enough channels, our current customers basically need to have a large one that is likely to belong to the same paragraph, which needs to be connected. I need to check a sentence by a sentence to determine which sentences are logically coherent and can be combined into paragraphs. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, if the timestamp is continuous, it may mean that the same person speaks continuously and can merge. For example, from [1425. 48-1427. 28] to [1456. 50] may be a complete paragraph, discussing the growth of the spherical plane and the flash.

In addition, the user's example, the answer part is divided into multiple timestamps, but is actually the same answer and needs to be merged. For example, there are multiple timestamps in relation to the pick-up of the new product, from [1460. 14-1466. 28] to [1483. 18], but the content should be combined into a paragraph. During the process, I need to make sure that no timestamp corresponding sentences are missing and that the original intention remains unchanged. At the same time, it is important to pay attention to the correct use of punctuation marks, such as adding appropriate punctuation marks at the end of the sentence, such as periods or commas, to enhance readability.

Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the whole paragraph verbatim text, check whether all the sentences are merged correctly, no omissions or errors, and maintain the integrity and accuracy of the original content. The path of the spherical verbatim is sufficient enough for our old customers to basically have a large demand that we have a flash to supply to them this year, so the flash is more important for this year's growth, so the integrated above in addition to China's growth is relatively low, and some of our other regions may look to have the opportunity to innovate higher and higher this year's reply. We are not looking at the domestic industry because we are raising a series of hand-overs when we are in the cross-border market, we are only in the past there are a series of hand-overs, so our strategy has always been that we are in the past there is a lot of hand-overs in the past there is a series of hand-overs, so why are we raising our products in the past there is a lot of hand-overs in the past there is a lot of hand-overs in the past there is a lot of hand-overs in the past there is a lot of hand-overs in the past there is a lot of time that we have to do with the past.

I think that's a good thing to ask this year is that this year is a more immediate product is a kinetic energy to talk about 24 years 25 years is the company's hope that the proportion of these three products will rise to a certain extent, the proportion of this product is about to rise to a certain degree, this proportion of this proportion of this proportion of this proportion of this proportion of this proportion of this proportion we are less likely to use numbers to estimate that we can simply say that we will have at least two to five customers this year after we start shipping this year after the first Japanese customer in the fourth quarter of last year, because just like they have just mentioned their poor slices already sold to a certain extent, he will want to increase the items of his new products closer to more consumers. I would like to ask about how much we expect to increase our business expenses this year, and if this year will be more than that this year's to have a lot of this year.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Another reason is that we are in the part of Japan in the flash. At first, it seemed to push only 50. We are now pushing to 2000. That's a growth like this. You can see what a contribution looks like.

That is to say, we are part of the United States because we have been in the World Light Center for some right of speech in the past. There is nothing in the future like the fact that we can see more clearly to dominate or divide them with doctors in the U.S. World Light Center, or something like that. Yes. A slight adjustment. A slight correction to not be a class is not just a single physical path. So just ask the whole market of Japan or the growth of TV in Japan.

No, no. No, not once. We didn't see so little about us because we were here because we were here at the headquarters and we were only talking about the doctor. If we look at the whole class there is also the doctor's channel and there is the online channel.

That's it. But the total scope should not be that large. So I don't want to know which part of the class we're going to add to it. So if we go back to astigmatism, it's really astigmatism, no matter whether it's 50 to 2000, it's a customer's way of looking at the total speed of the customer's goods.

In fact, our production line is now in stock because of the sudden demand for astigmatism. That is, if we look at it, the astigmatism will have a significant contribution to the honest speaking until the second half of this year. Because we still have the market demand, there will be a market reaction. So the contribution of the entire astigmatism to revenue may be obvious in the second half of this year.

It's really a tough market for America. It's honest to say that our customers are both online and in the United States. We don't really have any idea at the moment if that's a breakthrough. Wow, we still want to be able to find guests who are willing to take off the private bottom road in the United States, because after all, we're all fine with the astigmatism that's what we're doing now. All three of these products have the power to go offline.

That's what we want to say. We're sorry. There's a problem behind that. Thanks for asking the management about how the first 10% of our optimization was done. There's no possibility of optimisation in the future. Optimization is how much you'll spend on that new capacity of 46 million.

That's 4 million pieces of capital expenditure. Another problem is about the direction of future R&D. And that's to say how this R&D capability is now. Thank you. How much is every million pieces of 7000 to 9000.

Thank you for the investor's question. The second question is, of course, that 10% increase is mainly two parts: when we have engineers to improve the yield of our production. That part is the obvious improvement in the last three quarters of last year that we will continue to improve.

The second is that the part of the capital expenditure we have increased about one million dollars. The output of the good product is probably between $70 million and $90 million. I also see that the need for the actual design may include flashing ah or include flipping or everything else.

The other is the part of the color drop. Because the color drop we have grown to 30% last year, but you see that the entry in the country is about 50% more than the color drop. We used to be more comfortable, so the comfort of the transparent layer has been very good, so the next two or three years we have more focus on the research and development of the color drop here to match the saturation of the pattern with his technology to better meet the needs of the market customers.

Thank you, we still have investors to continue to ask questions. It's been a month since the opportunity is still good. Thank you.

A bad question may be to ask a more basic question is whether you cast 30% of the cast. The fine water glue. It is the amount of injection. The painting now accounts for our value 10 part is 30% of the fine water glue is the part of the cast. I would like to ask you is how much the fine water glue is the part of the film.

Watercolor glue accounts for 2%. Watercolor polishing is about 2%. So other fine colors are fine. OK, because we make 2% of total watercolor glue. Yes, so please ask again if you can split it into our 42 million figures.

This is the absolute number is more difficult to explain because the demand for each month is to adjust the demand of the order, basically our production line is that all products can be made of the glue. This is often the case for us.

'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, 'Umar ibn 'Umar ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him. In the last year, we had a lot of customers in China, and we had a lot of customers in the past. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of sales. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year. We had a lot of customers in the last year.

That said, last year's capacity of 38 million, this year's 42 million to the fourth quarter of 46 million. If you don't go too far this year, Expand, Trump, don't make too many problems, don't mess with the global economy. That said, if it's not too much surprise, then our company's capacity utilization is still above 90%, and I think this energy seems to be there. And that's our hope, we don't want our capacity utilization, and we want the company's capacity utilization to remain above 90%.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
