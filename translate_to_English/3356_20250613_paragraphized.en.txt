<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the verbatim text must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim fragments provided, paying attention to the corresponding sentences of each timestamp.

During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is in the correct position and does not disrupt the original speaking order due to the jump of the timestamp. For example, the user's transcription has some time gap between the words, such as from 45. 74 to 57.94, but according to the content judgment, these parts may belong to different speakers and need to be segmented correctly.

For example, at the timestamp 501. 48-501. 74 and 501. 74-503. 80, the content is duplicated "this is because the relationship between stock market fluctuations are relatively large", which can be a mistake, but according to the user's requirements can not modify the original, so it must be retained as the original, so it may be necessary to pay attention to the handling of the duplicate parts during finishing, to avoid affecting reading. In addition, the correct representation of the numbers and percentages, such as "2. 0. 6 billion" may need to be adjusted to "2.6 billion", but the user requests do not delete anything, so the original sentences must be preserved, even if they appear contradictory. Finally, to ensure that the structure of the entire paragraph-by-text text is clear, each part has a clear title or separation, such as a meeting, financial length, brief brief briefing, but the user does not require to be added in the order order.

Dear Chief Executives, welcome to join us today. I am glad that you are here today to be a part of the Chief Financial Officer of Qiyou Technology Co., Ltd., Mr. Li Jianbang, and Mr. Chen Jiang Renfeng. The meeting will be divided into two parts, the Chief Financial Officer of our Qiyou Group, and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Mr. Chen Jiang Renfeng.

The first half of the year we did not have a presentation, I just started a very simple one, and our first quarter was a loss. Overall, the performance of one of the industry's revenue growth is a recession, which is about 20% of the decline. The main reason for that is that the current demand for our European and American markets is not enough, and the relative supply is not enough, which leads to the first quarter of this year's performance is not the same as last year's. Of course, if we look at the first half of the year, we do not have a complete return of this part of the state, so the second quarter can only be balanced with the first quarter.

In the first quarter of the year, there was a so-called tariff event that occurred at the end of the first quarter, which is actually very important to us, because we have about 67 percent of the market comes from the US market, which is where our products are located in mainland China. The good thing is that there is now a tariff exemption period, and there is a relatively reorganization of our stock in the US market, so in the second quarter of the year, there are some shocks that are in the supply chain, and there are some measures that we can do after it is clear that we can make some adjustments, such as dispersed supply chain, etc., we have done it.

In the first quarter of the year, the Group of 2.6 billion compared to the first quarter of the year, with a total decrease of 19%, compared to the same period last year. The total revenue for the previous year was 5% compared to the year of 112.

In the first quarter, the gross profit amount was $13,200 million, and the gross profit margin was 50% higher than the previous quarter. In the first quarter, the gross profit amount was 13.8% lower than the first quarter, and the operating profit was 7% lower than the previous quarter. If the net profit amount is $130 million, then the net profit margin is about 60% lower than the first quarter, then the net profit margin is about 55% lower than the first quarter of the year.

In terms of net profit after tax and US stock earnings, the net profit attributable to the owner of the parent company after tax in the first quarter of this year is a loss of 1.83 million yuan, then the current share capital of the US stock earnings is calculated based on the current share capital of 79.99 billion, if the US stock earnings is a loss of 1.72 yuan, compared to last year is about...

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase transcript:. The same period last year was reduced by 166 percent. The same quarter was reduced by 180 percent compared to the same quarter. Next, we look at the group's revenue share across six states around the world. The highest proportion is still North America, including the United States and Canada. The proportion in the first quarter was 65%.

The following is the first quarter of Europe's total revenue of 16%. Asia includes the Middle East in the first quarter of 2012, followed by Taiwan's total revenue of 3%. Central and South America accounted for 2%. Oceania and Africa accounted for 2%.

Next, we divided the products into about 9 categories to analyze our group product revenue. Currently, the highest proportion of revenue is still the IP Camera. The first quarter is 55%. The second is about 7% of the total revenue from monitoring systems, access control products, group installation revenue, and peripheral purchases respectively.

Our AI management software is cloud management software, or we can support large-scale centralized monitoring CMS software, which totals 9% is our 2nd largest class. The following is a small proportion of the sales and RMA costs, including non-finished products, which accounted for 5%. The small proportion of the small proportions include our GB tablet decoder, which is 1%. And the license plate recognition system contains hardware and software, which accounts for 2%.

The third is that we want to develop a cloud-based control platform to integrate images from general intelligence and the cloud to become a control center. The third is that we want to use AI technology to analyze our software for a deeper application in various fields. The first is that we use AI to analyze the value of a product as a core part of a product. We are starting with the core of AI technology.

So some of our existing products include access control, access management software, or our central monitoring software for enterprise software mobile devices are the basis for our own development of a more profitable software compared to other peers. Under this foundation, we continue to use artificial intelligence at the core of our technology to continue the yellow triangle where we can launch a single-model cloud host that can have a vehicle detection function and can be connected to our cloud surveillance cameras and cloud surveillance software. Then, with the upcoming V20 video management software, it can integrate our software and hardware directly into the cloud platform.

The most important concept is the integration of the existing software hardware and front-end camera backend and camera monitoring system, in addition to the integration of the third party as long as it is the integration of the ONVAP or RTSP protocol, the camera monitoring system together with the cloud control platform architecture of the strange technology. The first thing we would like to do in this cloud architecture is to have three main products, namely our single-model CB Pro silver monitor host, and then with the strangely good software that has been good at it all, GB AI Guard VMS, which can integrate the images of the third party and the strangely own camera monitoring system into the general monitoring field, such as the temperature sensor detecting the infrared body temperature sensor, and even the general home gas sensor, can also be integrated through the strange IO Box.

This is why we have developed some software in traffic applications, such as the detection of lags in some controlled areas or the intrusion detection of road violations or the detection of traffic zones in certain areas, or the identification of traffic zones in traffic congestion or vehicle congestion and area, and even the identification of truck lockers in and out of the port, which we have developed in the future can be a good promotion in our traffic applications.

Our concept is to be able to launch a cloud control center. That is, of course, the architecture. The ability to excel in this system integration combines the ability of security owners, who will work together in the field to promote this security upgrade into the remote security of the cloud, and to further promote the digitalization of the cloud so far into the automation of monitoring. In order to achieve automation, we must first implement the software architecture of the CVW cloud control center that we just described through the CVW cloud control center, so that security providers can remotely control some of the sensors and video surveillance lanes can identify the car at the same time. For owners who need it, such as intercom or access control or even humane mail services, such as mobile app and remote security, will be able to enable our business models to be promoted from B2B to B2B2C in the future. To solve many dark fields when he wants to upgrade from a traditional system to a better digital system to a cloud, this will be one of the most important solutions for our owners here from CBW and our Cloud Cam which we hope to launch this year will be installed in some new dark fields and even CBW which can do a painless upgrade for traditional security providers by installing this traditional security provider of our CBW Server. The most important thing is that we can also reduce the problem of traditional security operators by reducing false alarms to more than 80% and by reducing false alarms. Another benefit is that he can also effectively reduce the staff of the control center to configure that which is very attractive to some security operators or some installers who are currently lacking in human resources. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

In this picture, there are some points in any of our points, such as AI, whether it is in the face recognition or intelligent recognition or some traffic safety, etc. It looks at where your application segment is, but now the most important thing is that there is a lot of single application, but there is no effective integration, which is now the development of some of the previously developed a single point of a single application, a single application, now doing another high level of integration, but this integration is really necessary for some industries, because there are many industries now we have access to such as the security industry, he said just mention a security, such as the brand recognition system, the monitoring system, and the security documents and mail, etc., they will be used these, but now for some security companies, it is independent, so in their respective management, there will be a lot of people to hire some of it, some management, and some of it is now, except we have a lot of what we have a lot of them.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, such as [2109. 38-2112. 46]

First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the overall content and themes. It looks like this section involves company cooperation, service pattern differences between the United States and Taiwan, product restrictions, exchange rate impact, and sales strategy. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or conversation in order to make reasonable segmentation. For example, from [2109. 38-2112. 46], I discuss the cooperation with image service companies, followed by a comparison with the service pattern in the United States, the differences between Taiwan and the United States, and the differences in control needs.

This part of the sales strategy section, beginning with [2359. 60-2364. 20], involves the role of distributor, installer and distributor, and case analysis. These content should be segmented to ensure that the details of each sales strategy are clear. During the process, I need to make sure that each sentence is in the correct order without missing anything. At the same time, note that timestamps may indicate a different speaker or topic conversion, but the user has no particular instructions, so it may need to be segmented naturally according to the content.

After the completion of the whole paragraph type transcript, confirm that all content is complete, the structure is reasonable, in line with the requirements of the user. </think> [paragraph type transcription]: The company that makes the form of image service to cooperate. What is the form of service in the United States? What is the form of service in Taiwan is completely different, because of the United States, so its control of this, its needs, and the type of security management of Taiwan belongs to the metropolitan type is not the same as the international, and the demand is not very consistent.

So, mainly because our MIC products have some restrictions, but in this way our other products are considered to be very good, because now we have to do such a result, is really a small, very few, most of them are their own parts, some have heard the brand or I have done someone to identify, I have done, but the problem is that when to integrate into a valuable system, may be a little difficult in this integration, it takes time.

The other part, because the other part will decrease every liter of the money, OK. That we each liter of the money to the revenue, like the last two dollars will suddenly affect a lot, then we have a little more, there is a little more, there is a little more, we have a little more, the U.S. income is about 80% of us, because we still have euros, so the US dollar is about 80%, but most of our overseas purchases are mostly U.S. dollars, so this part of the place will naturally be avoided. So the last shock is probably the case of each liter of the money, about 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, less than 0, 1, 1, 1 impact is the ratio that he will not understand, because the portion of the portion of the amount of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share is also is also is also has to each of the two million, the loss of the amount of the amount of money, will go away, the next three million, the next three million, then we will be a lot, if we will be more than a lot, if we will be more than a month, if we will be a lot, if we will be a thousand, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be a million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be a million, if we will be more than three million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, if we will be more than a million, a If you want to know more about our products, please let us know that most of our products are sold by way of distribution, and most of our current sales are sold through distributors, and there are also manufacturers who have done through the installer, because he himself has some of these companies in some government departments, because he has the basis of the project, so he knows the needs of the product and the needs of the product and the needs of him more clearly, and the other is that through some of the distributors said that he is just carrying a layout of a channel, and that the layout of this part of the layout is actually proportion or relatively high, like our United States, there are some very large customers in the channel mode of the way he is not an installer, so he strictly said before we have said that we are not very accurate, but very likely to take up about 60 percent, and more than the rest of the other operators, we have a lot of the same information about him, and we have a lot of the same product, and we have a lot of the same information about the same as the same as the same as the same as the same with the company. This is a very straightforward way to get some good results, but the time is really long.

Here's a re-routing paragraph-by-word transcript: Yes, there's a way to tell the size of the product. What size you're saying is that you say channel number or the small shop that's suitable after the low area. Oh, that's not the case. We have a lot of customers like the store department stores that he also uses like us before, far far away Utown, far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far away, far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far far from from from from from from from from far from from from from

This is the first time that we have ever had such a relationship with our customers. It is a good time for us to get into any small and medium areas, so you just said that we can not be used anywhere we have small and medium cases can be used. What we used to call it, we have that space cylinder, we have that space cylinder, there is a smart city, there is a long car look and monitor some applications, so it is just such a good place for such dealers to have such a relationship, so this product really won't be a lot of restrictions, but our customer relationship, his attributes because some of them are suitable for this public sector, some of whom he is suitable for banking or financial system, some of which he may belong to residential buildings or some schools.

The fourth quarter is usually the first time our industry is a relatively prosperous time, the second is that our products after this promotion after this time we have some opportunities to work together in the second half of the year, so I think this part of the opportunity is a bit higher.

Also, there was a mention of Poche, who you said, Poche, who sold his department. We had all done this before. In fact, every company he sold did not mean that he might have made some adjustments to the internal strategy. It was like the one who was the biggest of us, the SS, and later he sold it to Sony, who sold it to Sony in Japan.

Another one of our previous software vendors, Milestone, was the first brand in the software industry. He was also sold to the same Sony, so now I have found a problem is that it is actually safe and control products in the early days, he was a hundred contenders everyone wanted to do, and can do well. But now it will become big, he is not the market disappeared, he is going to do some integration in some markets. Because many small markets will face some lack of resources, some technical aspects and some lack of ability, he may be able to do some marginalization if he does not do so.

That is, for example, there are some people like me who really don't sell his strategy. You may also know that we are good in the country like Jinrui, Jinrui is also in this so-called too big field. That's why he's in control of the company's strategy. That's why it's about the company that Delta wants to do something like this. In fact, if the business size of the early is much worse than that of Taida, the problem is that he must have this part because if he wants to do a level of intelligence or do some sort of building management or something like that.

The only way to do that is to quickly a combination of the two businesses is to be a trend now. So now we are actually in business and open mind to look at this problem. But we feel that there are many places in the business that can follow the business, there are two kinds of business, one is someone else and us, and the other is a problem that we work with other people we do not discuss and merge.

So the market doesn't mean he knows who to sell to. But the market he sells is really lacking, because his market is based in Europe. That Europe we haven't done well in the last year or in the past, because the three markets of the country's language and German law have some difficulty, and there are some local well-known brands.

It seems that in 2008, it was set up, but it was only a very long time ago. That is, because you want to serve the local service from that grassroots level is not only the whole operation, the other is your after-sales service and technology, etc., so we can maintain a long-term relationship with the local, so we really spend a lot of thinking. But unfortunately, it is said that in recent years also will be affected by some kind of turmoil, like we do have a lot of talent in that place, because there are many languages in that place, because there are many people who understand French, who understand German, and who understand the Slavic language.

If we find a large European and American brand, usually the same type of large European and American brands, usually he has his own main system, he is not likely to use your system, so naturally we belong to the competitive state. There are some comparisons to the local secondary, his system itself is not strong, then if you say, or he does not have a system, he may want to borrow such a way to change some business model, he wants to create a brand, we can help him to create a new system so that he can operate, so this is what we want to do now is to find such a kind of cooperation object. This is the present moment, we are talking about some of the rules in cooperation with the security agreed this concept, of course, we also developed a very high level of security, the first largest third may have some good, suddenly to the other parts will say that he is based on the human, he will not agree with this technology and technology to protect this piece, so now we should be talking about how we are supposed to be able to find the right partner to turn the traditional security into a science and technology security, which, of course, contains the so-called monitoring is necessary, but also the integration of his existing sensors, because these sensors inside his original line can not be destroyed, but how to transfer his information through a box or a way to go to the cloud, and then there is to do unified management.

If you want to go to the control center, you have to transfer to another place, to the control center 24 hours another control center, or even to the radio or anything else to go to the cloud, that is really can do, so we are now integrating some of the like just said intercom to integrate VOIP, in fact, he is only in our system he has a node with a certain reasonable combination, a combination, a matter of this VOIP to do some integration, so the current security needs should be said, do not say the need.

This is what he is going to do in the future. That is to say, he should not say that the total number of people will be reduced, or even that they have a professional name. Half of it means that there is no one at night. Because there are a lot of costs, and so on, so when you do these things, you have to assist these related technologies. Of course, security also mentions what robot patrol that I think is waiting for.

In fact, this piece of China has gone fast, but there may not be anywhere else in Taiwan. So only in this piece will at least integrate the piece first. That part will give some security companies some good differences. This way, he will have some continued to compete in the market.

I think the next time they're going to do it right, we'll discuss it later if we have any questions. So thank you for your history today.
