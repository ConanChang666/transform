Now at 2:30 p.m., you are welcome to invest in advanced financial media friends. Join the three companies to purchase online corporate briefings. The company and the president's official official name, the company to buy traffic show CEO. The law will talk about the evolution of the company's operations and future prospects. Finally, the QA will be carried out.

Next, we will pass the time to the CEO. Thank you, everyone. I am Liu Yanxiu, the chief financial officer of the three-sector acquisition. Then I will explain to you. One of the operating performance in the first quarter of 2025.

There are some ongoing work in progress at the moment. And the future prospects. So you can see this disclaimer. Please refer to the following report.

That will first explain the current situation of the company. Then there will be a financial overview of the first quarter, and the future financial overview. Then there will be a outlook for the second quarter.

The first three companies to buy plus were listed in November 2021. That's probably more than three years so far. Currently, the stone capital is about $675 million. That has been announced a revenue until the end of March. That's $3.47 billion. The number of employees is about 3600.

There are currently four major retail channels under the three-storey addition. It contains one of the 800 stores. Then there are three Shinura market. There are also three-storey cosmetics. That is, TOMOZ15. And there is one of the ways we have acquired a good pet market from last year.

That's the current status of a channel for a three-store add-on. Let's talk about the three-store add-on to the current operating focus. As we just mentioned, we bought a one-store add-on to a pet market last September. It's a specialty store that focuses on a cat's one food item. That's starting to bring a combined revenue and profit to the company in the first quarter.

The next slide will be further explained. The other three companies will probably do a test of some new store models from last year. That, especially with the own brand, there is a percentage of imported goods. Hopefully, it will be an improvement every year.

In fact, our current test is a declaration completed. Then we will address each business district. A business district needs to be gradually transformed. And a dynamic adjustment at any time. So by the end of March 2025 there are a total of 252 alley cellars that we define. It can contain a shelf for 2 to 6 seats of wine.

This is a very important part of our work this year. It is also in the major capital expenditure section. In fact, these four major capital expenditures are now seen. The board agreed with the board last year. It is also in progress.

It is currently in a state of construction or acceptance. It is more specific to a procurement case about e-price cards. It was passed last year by the board of directors. That amount is also relatively large. It is currently about the 800 stores in the United States Union store. It is expected that the whole store will be installed in July this year.

So, let's start with some adjustments that include dynamic pricing. Then think about this e-price card. This shows a timely way to adjust the price.

A capital expense like this can get the most out of it. Maybe it will wait until the whole store is installed. We will talk further with you in the second half of the year. That just mentions the increase in affiliate rates. This is a very important part of our work this year.

This is mainly due to a recent shortage situation. In fact, all walks of life are facing this situation. In the past, we have seen this on the screen. A ratio of one membership in the past five years. Including one of our funds and one number of electricity to join. We have until the end of March of this year.

A total of a franchise ratio is about 27.63. That's probably a slight improvement compared to a few years ago. We also included in the Taipei Taipei Franchise Show this year to set up a booth.

That or attract some of the other industries. Some franchisees who are interested in joining are interested in joining a franchise to join a franchise. That is why they want to increase such a franchise ratio. Mainly franchises are in the operation of electricity.

Because of their own interests, so whether it is an increase in performance, it includes an act of promotion like a door. In fact, it is more positive than a direct store employee.

Bring one of this company to improve the profitability of the store. That is why we are constantly asking for this part. The affiliate group gives us such a boost. A feedback. Then find out how our direct store can also have such a cost savings.

Or other operating costs can be increased because of this cost savings. So-called store-side profitability. That is also included in the revenue portion. We also found that franchisees are placed at the headquarters. There is a need to do some focus sales items.

So that's why we've been doing this for the last few years. One of the main reasons we want to increase our affiliate rate. Then there's a section about the financial overview. That's a financial overview of the current first quarter.

The first quarter of this year's consolidated revenue was 34.7 billion. It was a slight increase of 3.16 percent compared to the last year's 33.6 billion.

A portion of the gross profit is also increased. The other part of the operating fee. Mainly comes from the salary of a basic salary increase. There is also an increase in electricity bills. Therefore, the operating cost is actually a slight increase. But the operating profit part.

That is, even if there is a growth in such a cost. Business benefits are still growing over the same period last year. Therefore, the interest attributable to the parent company is about 2901 million yuan, compared to the previous year's 2897 million yuan.

As we have just mentioned, we have made a improvement in the gross profit structure in recent years. So the gross profit part. Also because of the adjustment of the product structure. So it is resisted in this way.

Labor. The effect of electricity bill increase. A cleaning that results in a profit. That is why the net interest rate is part of the same period last year.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-text transcript: That in the $3.47 billion turnover, the United States affiliate accounted for about 3.2 billion yuan. In addition, the three drugstores, Tomox, and the good parts of the pet, account for about 200 million yuan. On the right side of this section, you can see that the first quarter is just a turnover of the United States affiliate, and that is a slight growth of 0.37%. But this year, because we cooperated with one of the adjustments in the number of electrons, when we decided to close the store, we will cooperate with the new part of the opening, and then let people to carry out the transfer.

So, in fact, the same first quarter, in fact, a business day in 2025, is actually lower than last year's. But the turnover here is an increase. So the current word is to say that through this adjustment, and then to eliminate some of the stores with poor physical condition, the decrease is to feed these stores, and increase the loss of a company. In the commodity structure, as we have just mentioned, in recent years, we have made an effort to adjust the structure of this commodity, hoping to increase the ratio of a commodity with a gross profit rate higher than that of a commodity imported from 2023 to 2024. So, we can see that the first quarter of this year is a slight increase from the turnover of the part is also from 17. 06 percent and then to 18. 2% of such a structure.

So after we have retained a certain amount of money, this year we decided that although we have made a profit in the same period last year, we have made a total of $2.02, then we have decided to allocate $1.5. So in this place is the hope that shareholders can be inclusive, it is our decision that we want to keep a portion of the funds for the future expansion of a preparation. The future outlook is actually as much as the February law says, the main thing is that we have helped the team on several projects a very large experience contains the so-called nine foal store part, which now seems to be very successful in this place test, for the turnover and a gross profit improvement actually has a very big help.

In fact, this part is not to say that we are instantly replacing the goods on the shelf, and then replacing them with our own brand consumers will accept it. So, including this brand's communication, there are some generation factories looking to include a generation factory that is said to be suitable for our goods, but in this place we can see that this proportion is actually a slow increase in the years before.

In addition, in the coffee section, almost all of our stores have introduced such a coffee sales, then our so-called PSD is a single store one-day sales multiple, and now there is a continuous increase. In addition, in the pet area, there are a total of 114 products that have expanded the pet category sales, and then it will be mentioned that there is a difference in the way a pet has a good investment in a subsidiary and a pet category of the United States.

In addition, there is a part of the pet retail that we have just mentioned in September last year, we acquired a good pet city such as five stores at the time of their acquisition, which opened two other stores in December last year, respectively in Taipei Nangang and Xinzhuang in New Taipei City, which is a relatively large compared to other pet stores. In fact, it is a relatively large store, especially a cat-like product as a store, which is also in the overall position of other pet stores is not the same, including it has to cooperate with animal hospitals, so it sells a more professional food nutrition products, etc. We also hope that by working with such a good pet market, to improve a certain kind of pet products, which is still ongoing, and with the consumer response, we continue to adjust all the two pet shelves above.

The above is a simple description of the current part of the good city for pets. Here is a description of a business overview of the first quarter of the Sanan structure, and you don't know if you have any problems with investors.
