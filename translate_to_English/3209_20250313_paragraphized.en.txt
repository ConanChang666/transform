In the fourth quarter, you can cover some losses in the first three quarters, so the exchange profit and loss also helped to increase some. Therefore, you can see that the net profit before the whole tax increased by about 35 to 36% compared to the previous year. Net profit before tax, if back to EPS increase by about 15%. Take a closer look, you can also see that the income tax rate has increased by more than 100 million compared to the same year last year.

Of course, this is not a real cash flow problem, this is an effect of avoiding income tax. So, this is the impact, but overall it is more than three dollars EPS, compared to last year. The entire financial structure we have just talked about, because we keep stock degradation, and there is a lot more money costs to detoxify. So, you can see the entire debt ratio, less than 70% is the best financial structure in nearly three years.

The first is that it can control the risk, because the bond is sold. The second is that when the money demand, it can be financed. When we continue to depreciate the stock of a situation, in fact, the money is quite abundant, we choose super high-quality customers, but in fact, it is no longer the case, because after all, it brings a handling fee. So, we use our own funds to cover these, so of course, there is a slight decline in the number of days, but it is a very healthy situation.

We can see the following report or 90 days, in the second half of the two quarters of this year has actually reached this level of 69 to 72 days, has been a healthy stock water level. Looking at the whole profitability, whether it is ROA or ROE, has basically reached a better level of numbers. That's a slight rebuttal, including this in 112 years, 112 years compared to the industry, we still belong to this kind of shareholder-friendliness rate we belong to the top three. That's not known this year, because we haven't seen a number of other households.

So, the main application is to say that these wind power power power, or, of course, the most popular is in this server movie supply, where there are many components. Of course, the car is the same, but also a large part of this place digestion. The top right part is the relatively early so-called IoT face, including the traditional HAI sensor, which now a larger mainstream in the future is this edge AI, the AGE AI will be in this part.

The data center in addition to the traditional general-purpose server, and related applications of a variety of devices or boards or chips, in fact, the AI server is a helping support, so this is the whole company's main focus. The next year is still around this core, continue to develop. If you take a closer look at it, in terms of broadband, on the left is a variety of applications, the right may be your business in the home or in the individual, the middle of this is a transmission of all our so-called media.

This year will be a big change, last year is still the first half of this DAIS3. 0, but in the second half of the year, the business has declined very little. In this DAIS4. 0's attention, this year is a remarkable, if the whole cable, this year may be compared to the last year in the cable business, there may be more than 60% growth, this is from this piece. Wi-Fi7 can be expected in fact, this year will be more than the middle of the main, such as the PC phone, the majority of the company in the network, so the majority of the company sees Wi-Fi7, is from the network devices, whether router is good, or in the cable, with the POM, this piece of Wi-Fi.



So you can say that the router is good, or the power is good, so it's always here. Wi-Fi is good, so don't talk to the PC and the phone, because this comparison is not in the scope of our discussion.

I can use a few simple numbers first. If I had Wi-Fi 7 in the first half of last year. Wi-Fi 7 accounts for about 10% of my Wi-Fi.

I expect this first half of this year. It is expected that Wi-Fi 7 will probably break through. 40% in all Wi-Fi applications. The second half will probably break through 60%. This is from my own perspective.

This is Wi-Fi 7. That's true. Wi-Fi is from Wi-Fi. Since last year's Wi-Fi 6 was a big one, whether it's cheaper or not.

The first half of the year, Wi-Fi 6, was really large. But what you can see, the second half of the year actually started to fall down. So of course, this is reflected in the company's revenue.

For example, Wi-Fi 7. Wi-Fi 6 is gradually becoming a reality. It contains a lot of inventory of customers or anything. So it's no comparison. That's what you can see. If you compare the machine.

Wi-Fi 6 will continue this first half of this year. It will grow more than Wi-Fi 6 in the second half of last year. But it will not be the first half of last year.

So overall. See the progress of Wi-Fi 7. If the whole view. A growth of Wi-Fi. I think. The chance is to add 6 plus 7.

The chance of growth is about 20 to 25%. The growth of Wi-Fi 7 should be about one. Two or three percent. This is probably the concept of falling down. 6 looks like falling down.

That's it. This is a report on Wi-Fi. I don't know if the answer is clear or not. Well, the second question is, about Trump's tariff policy.

What is the impact on the company's Southeast Asian market layout. Please run the team to reply. OK Thank you. This part of the tax. In fact, Trump 1. 0 and 2. 0 appear to be a little different.

That part is relatively simple. It is purely U.S.-China trade. So the time is facing. The manufacturers are mainly to him. He transferred his production line. The main purpose of the transfer production line is to say.

Because he goes to Southeast Asia for example. He has a relatively low tax. Or some households that are more favorable. So you can see that there are a lot of vendors. Or even move to Mexico. Because it is one of the agreements between the US and Canada.

But on the 2.0 side, there is another. So even so far. From the company's point of view. It affects the world.

I don't know. That's what the company can do. That's the balance. That's why, in the fourth quarter of last year. Even if you join the whole of Southeast Asia.

Because he was already a team. That he was in Thailand in Indonesia. Even the Philippines had some cooperation. That we wanted to say through Singapore. This Southeast Asia headquarters. Can be heard in the future.

There is a relatively suitable face-to-face. The above report. Well, there is an online investment advanced and then ask. Take a look at the group as a channel. Is there a feeling of Netcom IC? There will be a noticeable recovery in 2025.

I can probably use it to see. I have a company related to myself. That is, the company is in. For example, if I look at it, that customer order to look at it. Almost last year January.

Last year was January 2024. Almost all of it was the highest point of a customer's order, and then it was already degraded.

The new order is called Ninbooking. It has always been lower. Even sometimes the low is as low as 0.5. This is the structure of the past. It can be seen clearly. The last 4 months the so-called new order.

I've always climbed up. That's the same thing. I just made a few estimates. Included in docs 4. 0. In Wi-Fi 7. That's true.

It is a relatively long-term sales. You can see the results of the future. So if you look at Netcom from the point of view of pure network. I see, because the foreign stock is also relatively degraded. Then the demand began to rise.

That 2025 will be better than 2024. That's probably what I'm looking forward to. This whole observation from the point of view of the IC communication. Thanks for the report above.

Ask the management team again. Will there be a new product agent in 2025. Please reply by the management team. OK Thank you.

"We have seen them before," he said, "and we have seen them before, and we have seen them before, and we have seen them before.

How to restructure a company's strategic structure, because in fact, everyone is bigger, already made hundreds of billions, even a sign, that's not really a thing.

A level to play. Because that's going to cost a lot of money. Even a very low gross profit to do so. That's not what the company wants. The company wants to be in the long run. So take an example.

The company was very early. Probably 10 years ago. There have been a number of products that have been introducing a relatively high quality inductors. Then, of course, you know that the upstream factory also undergoes various integrations. It was three or four years later.

This company is also incorporated into the company. It is the largest in the world. It is a supplier of this major convergence. It is the world's largest convergence provider. It is not just here. So it is constantly mergers and acquisitions included.

In addition, the company is also doing something else, or is currently in the stage of NDA, trying to run some customers, which is a relatively good high-end, foreign well-known brand, which is mainly in the electronics industry, which looks good, and then looks at the company. The last thing is, because after the war of new trade in China and Britain, the whole Chinese team, they have introduced more so-called red supply chain brands, then there are some good results, whether it is in the automotive industry, or in many other different applications, so it is better to get a lot of new products.

This year is 2025 or 2024? 2025? 2025 OK, I just reported that in the process, because the network business is not good in 2024, so the basic maximization has declined, but in fact, because the other included in the data center end, coupled with a lot of business, so it has just brought growth, that just mentioned, Wi-Fi 7 Ambassador 4. 0, this is will grow, so this will certainly bring benefits, the first in the data center, or an example, we see for example, DISC, what is its impact, when DISC happened, it has been in the call center, so now to take the example of China for example, many companies, because it wants the so-called information security relationship, so many companies began to think so, that it is to be the server, that the server is actually called other common type, or these servers, these amounts have not been predicted to increase, and then increase, and then from a lot of business growth, thank you.
