The following is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph type:. We welcome you to participate in the first quarter of 2025 of the juridical briefing. We are going to start the legal process now, thank you.

First of all, I would like to introduce the financial situation of the first quarter. We can see that the profit margin for the first quarter is 7.600 million, the average gross profit margin is 38.3, and the net profit after tax is 90 million. There is no change in the current quarter, so the EPS for the first quarter is 0.4 dollars. The part of encouragement is because we are losses in 113 years, so we decided not to distribute encouragement here at the beginning of March. That is because the first quarter is profitable, then the current ROE is 3%.

The gross profit portion of the product gross profit is basically about 47% of the total gross profit in the last year. The profit portion from the first quarter of that year began to make a slight profit from the first quarter of this year, then we look at the first quarter of that year's profit. The first quarter of that year's gross profit was 76%, then YY was 72%, and QOQ was 10% growth. The gross profit portion of that product, from the first quarter of the year's third quarter of the year's 36.5, then the end of the year's 37.6, that year's QOQ was 38.7.

It mainly reflects the degradation of some of our stock, which used to be relatively expensive in the past, and the new cost is relatively low, which slowly reflected in our product sales group. That is because with the inventory of our agents also degradation, there will be a shift in the middle of achieving the Maori. There is a relatively large turn, which is now visible from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, and that is relatively small.

That's why there will be an increase in fees compared to the first quarter of last year, which is mainly the fact that the first quarter of the year is actually the $2.56 billion, and there is one in it that is about $52 million for a reversal of a credited account. It is mainly ranked in the first quarter of last year because we expect to deal with almost some of the credited accounts, so it is a reversal, so if the reversal is actually lower or lower compared to the first quarter of last year.

This part is mainly reflected in the income we invest in, whether it was the fourth quarter of last year or the first quarter of the year. That is because the overall turnover here is not a loss of operations, which in fact we have identified in the first quarter of this year as a profit. It is also slowly going back to the beginning of these agents to build a profit state.

In the middle of the first quarter, we identified a locking interest. That part belongs to my Taiwan here in 2022, and then it was approved in March. The locking interest is much more than the tax we expected from our first advertisers, so there will be a lot more of that locking interest. So in the first quarter, the EPS total is 0.4 pieces. Then we look at the combined balance of assets. In fact, at the end of March, we can see that the total assets in our total assets are about 58 billion, and we can see that the part of the money in our assets is about 50 billion.

We can see that funds are in fact growing in terms of the fact that they are in fact, as compared to last year's first quarter versus last year's end. In addition, we pay attention to the degradation of stock, so we can see that we have stock down to 11.200 million as of the end of March, which is 1.5 billion compared to 11.900 billion compared to the same time last year.

A current current liquidity debt is about 15.8 billion, of which 1 billion is a short-term fluctuation of our bank. The total amount of that debt is about 35% of the total assets. That's not too much of a change. A current debt ratio is also considered healthy. Below we can see that the number of days a current earning receivable proceeds will fall to about 54 days. This is also consistent with the current creditworthiness of one of our key clients.

The stock has been degraded as we have just seen the drop in the water level of the stock. The number of days of a week in the stock has dropped to 226 days, about seven and a half months. We will continue to digest our existing stock. That flow rate is three times now.

As the first quarter of this year saw an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That is why the sales of MCUs are also increased than the sales of that one. So the total sales of MCUs in the first quarter of 2025 was 50,000 million. That QOQ was 13% and that YY was 85%. The number of MCUs shipped was basically flat compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

The number of shipments is 95.5 5k. From here, it can be seen that the number of shipments has not increased, but its amount is increased. The main reason for that increase is that this special chip for the security market smoke rioter 32bit shipped to the United States in the first quarter of this year began to produce a large number of shipments in the first quarter.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and organize them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, for example, [572. 10-576. 72] This shipment quantity for the first quarter of this year was 12.7k. My task was to combine these chronologically arranged sentences into consecutive paragraphs while retaining all content.

First of all, I will check each entry in a sentence to see which sentences can be logically linked together. For example, the parts of the touch chip, from [572. 10-576. 72] to [623. 10], are discussion about the touch MCU, and may need to be merged into a paragraph. Similarly, the parts of the security market, health products, BLDC motor control, etc. also need their own paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may have timestamps, but the contents are continuous. For example, [588. 24-589. 00] and [589. 52-592. 08] The smart home appliance... may belong to the same topic and need to be merged.

In addition, the user refers to "not to delete any sentences", so even some sentences look duplicated or incomplete, such as [608. 00-608. 50] that need to be kept in paragraphs. This may mean that the sentences need to be handled during finishing, but remain the same. During the process, I need to ensure that sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order and logically consistent. For example, on the security market, from [624. 68-628. 00] that security market to [649. 52] 246%, followed by [650. 02-650. 80] and then [651. 04654. 38] the current security market... these need to be merged into a paragraph, while retaining all timestamps and content.

According to the example provided by the user, there is no timestamp for finishing paragraphs, so I need to remove the timestamps, keep only the content, and merge the relevant sentences into paragraphs. Finally, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all the contents are correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs, and that no change in the original or order. For example, the portion of a healthy product is from [693. 12-696.72] to [724.92], the two digits, which need to be merged into a paragraph while retaining all the details. After completing these steps, read the finishing paragraphs again to ensure smoothness and accuracy, while adhering to the user's requirements without any deletion or rewriting.

Then the QOQ is negative 14%YY is positive 19%. That's because the touch chip is the MCU it is mainly used in this field of smart home appliances. The smart home appliance it is affected by this first quarter of the Lunar New Year. So in the first quarter, the number of this volume is going to decrease. Our biologic touch chip is from the end of Q1 in 2023, and until the second half of 2024, the agent with the customer its inventory gradually degraded.

The security market just mentioned that by the first quarter of this year, our export to North America, this UK insurance provider began to ship in bulk. So in the first quarter of 2015, our total shipment quantity was 11k, QOQ was 39%, and YY was 246%. That's nearly half of its current order went out of the United States, and it currently looks like it didn't have much impact on the U.S. tariff, and it didn't have much impact on the first half of this year.

The number of shipments we shipped in the first quarter of this year was 8. 7k, which was 38% YYYY down by 20% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The reason for that recession was not because we had fewer orders, mainly because our delivery was not enough. There are a lot of customers at present, several IC models are in the production of the R-RUN family. So in the second quarter, this number should be restored to two numbers.

That started in Q1 of 2023. It was also the beginning of the second half of last year, because the dealer and the customer's stock area began, then the order began to come back. At present, the status of this shipment is the start is a steady recovery. The number of RF products in the first quarter of this year was 2. 6k. The QOQ was a small decline of 2%, and the RYY was 141. The device IC was also the start of the second half of last year.

The number of chargers for electric vehicles is 1. 6k, and the QOQ is positive 4%, and the RYY is negative 5%. From 2023 to 2024, this charger is basically two-wheel three-wheel electric vehicles charger is a stable state. The new national standard for electric vehicles in mainland China will have a wave of certification in May.

It was mentioned earlier that this security product began a large shipment in the first quarter of this year, so its weight rose from 9% to 18% compared to the previous year. The health product because this shipment in the first quarter was not good, so its weight fell from 16% to 10% in the first quarter. The small home appliance this piece because it was a traditional low season, so it said that its weight dropped slightly from 22% to 19% in the fourth quarter of last year.

1. Strictly retain all original content without deleting any sentences. 2. Establish paragraph consistency through punctuation (statements, commas) and logical links ("then," so," etc.). 3. Preserve the original oral expression (such as "this," that," etc.). 4. Maintain professional terms and data accuracy (such as "QOQ", "YY", "R-RUN", etc.) 5. Reorganize the content in chronological order and topic to form a natural paragraph.
