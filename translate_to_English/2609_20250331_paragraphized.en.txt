#Yangming Ocean Freight's 2024 operational report is transcripted. **2024 Operational Report**. This is a significant growth compared to 2023. This part gives us a more important point, with respect to the overall Yangming Ocean Freight's performance in 2024, mainly in 2024.

In fact, the distribution has made some slight changes over the entire season. There is not much change. However, in terms of shipping costs, the average shipping cost is actually the most significant contribution to the entire group revenue in the third quarter. The average oil price is actually quite stable. Then our shipping costs are quite similar to that of the Shanghai Stock Exchange index.

Then the fourth quarter gradually went down. Then, of course, it was a relatively low point. Next. That is a financial indicator of our company. For the second quarter of 2024, we reached a high point in the change in gross profit margin. Next.

Our net worth per share reached 97.52 in Q4 in 2020. Earnings per share were reported just 1.18 pieces in 2024. Our liquidity is much healthier than it is currently. 598%. The balance sheet is also within 30%.

Again, the second quarter ended because of the first quarter. For the second quarter, of course, we now know that after the US tariff announcement on April 2, the whole market. The market situation may be a bit more clear. But we are now expecting the second quarter is still a tradition.

The US-U.S. line is slowly entering a peak season. So we think that the volume of goods in the second quarter should be more optimistic than the first quarter. But we can't ignore some of the effects that tariffs may have on this must be closely monitored.

The Honghai crisis continues, so every ship company is winding down. There is no change in the situation of the good corner winding down. Together with the port at the time of the new and old alliances. The harbour crossing is actually very serious. These uncertain interferoperability factors are actually present in the second quarter or always there, so the entire market development is, of course, the second quarter will be optimistic and certainly the uncertainties than in the first quarter.

These tariff policies are geopolitical. Together with the growth of the entire volume can be predicted. A second quarter after the third quarter is currently a relatively clear fourth quarter or continue to be observed. The above is a brief thank you.

We have received questions from corporate clients in advance. The following is a question from my representative to the company. If you have any questions about advanced investing, you can also type a question in the chat room.

The first question to ask is the outlook for supply and demand and shipping prices in 2025. In fact, in 2025, supply and demand was just presented in a briefing that the whole gap was gradually narrowing compared to 2024.

In addition to the impact of tariff policy on the economy. So the whole shipping cost is now 2025 because of the possibility of investment advanced will also ask long-term questions. Long-term is better than the contract status in 2024. However, in the spot market is a short-term contract in terms of short-term contracts, we believe that there will be a fluctuation in the situation because market uncertainties exist in the short-term, so this part is more difficult to predict the upward and downward fluctuations. Thank you in 2025.

What is the contract price range for the U.S. line? Thank you. There is still an answer to this. It has been said that the contract price has reached an agreement so far is higher than that of 2024. Overall, it is indeed higher than that of 2024.

Next, the third question. Hon Hai. What do you think about the shipping price? Is there a time when the shipper has a consensus to start not winding around?

In the current situation. We are. Unless there is a 100% certainty that this safe sailing. Shipping costs, of course, if the sea. For the cabin supply. For the cabin supply.

But, of course, this has a negative impact on shipping prices over the long term. In the short term, if it really comes back. Thanks. Does Trump's tariff policy have a positive or negative impact on global trade volume?

It's hard to estimate. Trump's tariff policy affects how much he might be able to do after April 2.

There will be no short-term or long-term corrections in the future. This part is relatively difficult. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments that are provided to confirm each timestamp and the corresponding sentences. Then, I need to sort these sentences in logical order into paragraphs while keeping the original timestamp and content intact. It should be noted that some sentences may fall into the same paragraph, such as a continuous statement or answer, while others may fall into different questions or themes that require segmentation processing. For example, the first question provided by the user relates to the manufacturer's dispersion of trade bases to Southeast Asia or India, followed by trends about the dispersion of the source, as well as the impact of tariff policies.

During the processing process, I need to ensure that the beginning and end of each paragraph connect naturally, while retaining all the timestamps and the original sentences. In addition, be aware of the user mentioned "do not delete any sentences", so it is necessary to check the sentences one by one to make sure that there are no omissions or additions. At the same time, avoid using any format such as coarseness or italics to keep the plain text. There may be some challenges, such as a large interval between timestamps, or there is a jump between sentences, which need to determine how to properly segment. For example, when the answer ends, there may be a "thank" or "next question" tip, which can be used as a basis for segmentation.

In addition, pay attention to the consistency of the sentence, ensuring that the transition between paragraphs is natural and does not make the reader stand out. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the whole paragraph verbatim again to check if all the original content is properly preserved, no omissions or errors, and the paragraphs are reasonably divided and in line with the user's expectations. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but according to the example provided by the user, should be able to handle it smoothly.

This is a situation in which the shipper is dealing with the entire tariff policy. It is difficult to estimate the impact of that volume. After all, it is important to see how much this tariff war will affect the subsequent global economy before we can estimate how much the global trade volume will affect.

Next question. The U.S. will charge you a port parking fee for China-made vessels, asking the company how likely it is to actually implement it and the impact on global capacity supply. I would like to point out here that the U.S. Trade Representative Office held two public hearings on 24 March and 26 March respectively.

In the present case, because the details of the implementation have not yet been officially out, there is a time for the opening of one of the directions he received, and there is a stage of the opening, a scope of the stage of the expropriation, which is unclear at the moment. Therefore, a scope of impact we need to further observe at present. Thank you. The next question I want to ask about the impact of environmental shipping on costs and shipping prices. The part of the shipping price I want to determine should be based on supply and demand.

The part of that green ship, of course, has a certain correlation with one of his commitments above ESG. The two should not be directly related to one of the factors above. Thank you. The next question I would like to ask about the impact of the three major ocean freight alliance changes. After the original T-H-EA Alliance changed to Premium Alliance at the end of January, the current operation is basically smooth.

The connection between T-H-EA and the old route and the connection to the new route has changed in the industry. On the service of the route, there is basically no gap on the transfer. That's how it is. Thank you. We've received a few questions in the chat room at the moment, and I'm asking a question on my behalf.

Market analysts believe that Yangming Maritime is not keen on the spread of more than 20,000 TIL, because the company's focus is on cross-pacific routes, is it true? This is not possible to say that because the entire spread of a need to spread a size, and eventually will return to a scale of our business, as well as industry companies, one of the relevant factors above the overall layout will be included in this assessment. I am not sure about this aspect that the good people do not know where 20,000 TIL comes from, but we do not currently exclude such a transmission of 20,000 TIL from one of our future route planning. Thank you for the next question.

If, of course, the third quarter is different from the past, but the forecast will have one more correction after the second quarter. In terms of the impact of the tariffs, everyone is observing that it may take a few weeks before everyone can see the real situation. Thanks for the next question.

What are the advantages of pure fuel? Three 8000T ships purchased yesterday were basically methanol pre-made. In this regard, in addition to taking into account the sections of his future ships sailing, the LNG host or methanol host will also take into account the impact he has on the entire ship volume and the area of sailing will be a comprehensive assessment.

This is difficult to do an analysis, because the overall cost of 2025 is higher than that of 2024. We can not say that the cost of 2025 is really high, because the cost of the entire pier, and there are some environmental factors, which will cost some higher. However, I do not have much difficulty in talking about the details of the cost of the pier. However, in the case of the dealer, in 2025, they also understand that the whole goods owner has a stable expectation, because the whole world is quite uncertain, they also want the dealers to strengthen the stability of this part of the service, so in the case of the contract price, it is relatively easy to reach a consensus.

Thank you. The next question is how much of our fleet is built in China? The parts of our own ship are not built in China. Thank you.

The next question is to ask the company's capital expenditure plan for this year. Our current company's capital expenditure plan is roughly divided into several, and the first part of the company we expect to make a announcement before this year's board of directors.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcripts:. This year it is expected to be built in addition to this [1648. 86-1652. 70]. Construction and purchase [1653. 22-1654. 74]. A total of 13 8000 to 15000 ships [1655. 26-1659. 62].

There is another part of the cabinet that needs to be done to make a further old replacement of the new one [1672. 46-1677. 06]. Then we will make an appropriate adjustment to a future business needs [1677. 321682. 18]. This part of the cabinet will also be included in this year's capital expenditure planning [1682. 44-1686. 28]. An expenditure planning [1686. 80-1688. 08]. Overall, about [1688. 34-1689. 62].

Some other investment opportunities will be included in the thank-you [1697. 30-1700. 88]. Thank-you [1702. 46-1706. 56]. Thank-you [1706. 82-1712. 96]. The next question is when Yangming Maritime will be able to complete the orders of all 13 ships [1714. 24-1720. 38].

We will proceed with the relevant internal procedures after the conclusion of the board [1720. 64-1725. 50]. If that is confirmed, we will immediately follow the external report thanks [1728. 82-1729. 60]. Thanks [1729. 86-1732.42]. The next question is to ask in general [1732.-1735. 02]. Due to the uncertainty of the tariff policy [1735. 28-1739. 62].

This [1744. 74-1745. 26]. This [1745. 52-1747. 82]. It is possible to do such an estimate of course I [1748. 08-1751. 14]. It was mentioned in [1751. 66-1753. 20].

The main route is [1775. 80-1761. 38]. He was about higher than last year [1761. 64-1762. 42]. That was the short way [1762. 72-1765. 02]. The current part is about the spot market [1765. 28-1767. 58]. Presently a [1767. 84-1769. 38]. A state of volatility [1769. 62-1773. 22].

The growth of that number is now impossible to make a prediction [1769. 62-1773. 22]. But basically it is fluctuate and uncertainty is 2025 [1773. 46-1779. 10]. A phenomenon that may occur throughout the market [1779. 36-1778. 20]. Thanks [1787. 54-1788. 06]. Thank you [1788. 58-1792. 42]. The next question is to ask the company's short-term ratio [1792. 72-1796. 56].

This seems to have been asked every time [1796. 82-1797. 32]. I [1797. 58-1803. 72]. Last time I said that it was basically one of the pages of the company [1803. 98-1807. 56]. The secret is that we are not convenient to reveal thanks here [1803. 98-1807. 56]. Thank you [1810. 38-1810. 90]. Thank you [1811. 40-1812. 42].

Next question [1812. 68-1818. 06]. The presentation provides the fuel cost amount for the first three quarters of 2024 [181818. 32-1821. 38]. Please ask for the amount of 2024 throughout the year [1822. 46-1852. 24]. You can now refer to the terminal [1852. 46-1882. 44].

Mirror and Dot column [1942. 46-1972. 44]. Mirror and Dot column [1972. 46-2002. 44]. Mirror and Dot column [2002. 46-2032. 44]. Mirror and Dot column [2032. 46-2062. 44]. Mirror and Dot column [2062. 46-2092. 44]. Mirror and Dot column [2092. 46-2122. 44].

苍uses[2182. 28-2182. 46]. 苍uses[2182. 46-2186. 60]. This question, of course, raises tariffs, of course, [2186. 60-2189. 60]. Of course, there is a certain effect on the economy [2189. 60-2190. 96].

This company is unable to make a prediction [2197. 36-2299. 40]. I have mentioned [2199. 40-2203. 82]. This means that U.S. manufacturing may not be possible in the short term. [2203. 82-2208. 36] It is still necessary to make a purchase from other countries. [2208. 36-2212. 30] So the transfer of the manufacturing place of goods [2212. 30-2219. 40]. This may be the beginning of tariff implementation. [2219. 40-2224. 44]

Initially, it is a short-term situation [2224. 44-2229. 30]. The part of the demand for [2229. 30-2234. 44]. This must be done after the implementation of the details [2234. 44-2234. 90]. Thank you [2234. 90-2238. 40]. Thank you [2238. 40-2240. 10]. Next question [2240. 10-2242. 04].

Please ask for port [2242. 04-2246. 84]. The number of days flight accuracy and the average speed of ships [2246. 84-2247. 34]. Thanks [2247. 34-2258. 74]. This section may be more specific about which port is being proposed port [2258. 74-2264. 58]. With the port that we are currently observing in Asia [2264. 58-2267. 26]. Shanghai Ningbo Yantian Shekou Singapore [2267. 26-2271. 26].

There are about two to three days of sewer port [2272. 04-2278. 54]. The current situation of the sewer port in Canada may be slightly longer [2278. 54-2280. 54]. About a week or so [2280. 54-2283. 54]. The European port is almost the same time as this [2283. 54-2290. 54]. The accuracy of the sailing period is generally a report on C-intelligence [2290. 54-2273. 54]. The most recent report has also been released [2293. 54-2300. 04].

There may be some improvement in the ship class accuracy of the major alliances in the starting port of the route [2300. 04-2301. 24]. As for a network situation [2301. 24-23001. 44]. We also have a lot of research to talk about [2301. 44-2301. 64]. We also have a lot of research to talk about [2301. 64-2301. 74]. We also have a lot of research to talk about [2301. 74-2331. 44]. We also have a complete floor Rfunction [2331. 44-2331. 54].

We have many floors R chair[2331. 54-2333. 16]. Western Trans Pacific [2333. 16-2335. 48]. What is the vision of the European line [2335. 48-2337. 36]. What is the difference with the previous alliance [2337. 36-2338. 76]. What is the difference with [2338. 76-2347. 02]. I'm here to add [2337. 02-2348. 50].

It is [2348. 50-2351. 08]. Through this time a change [2351. 08-2353. 24]. From the original THEA was changed to [2353. 24-2354. 06]. Premium Alliance [2354. 06-2356. 94]. That is basically what we are on the route [2356. 94-2358. 78]. One frequency that starts above [2358. 78-2360. 46].

There is no less than the original [2360. 46-2363. 06]. A structure of THEA [2363. 06-2364. 56]. That is [2364. 56-2365. 96]. Part of the American line [2365. 96-2369. 02]. It is part of the European and Mediterranean line [2369. 02-2370. 66]. By following this [2370. 66-2372. 40].

A MSC exchange [2372. 40-2374. 62]. We compare [2374. 62-2375. 88]. A previous architecture [2375. 88-2377. 90]. In the frequency also added [2377. 90-2380. 38]. A portion of that Atlantic line [2380. 38-2382. 56]. Because Sunshine is on the scale of [2382. 56-2383. 58].

It is relatively small [2390. 46-2392. 58]. Good thanks [2390. 58-2394. 56]. Next question [2394. 56-2397. 62]. Ask if the company can share [2397. 62-23400. 96]. 2025 to 2029 [2400. 96-2405. 96]. The idea of annual depreciation planning [2405. 96-2409. 86].

For example, maintain the same as [2409. 86-2412. 30]. Or increase or decrease [2412. 30-2413. 40] annually. Thanks [2420. 46-2428. 62]. Depreciation should not change too much [2428. 62-2430. 54]. Because the most recent is [2430. 54-2431. 84]. Also common [2431. 84-2433. 30].

There is a converted boat [2433. 30-2434. 34]. It will not be possible [2434. 34-2436. 90]. Subtraction to Theatre Cavern [2436. 90-2438. 32]. This idea [2438. 322439. 08]. The situation is [2439. 08-2440. 62]. víá [2440. 62-2441. 90].

The account is relatively small [2441. 90-2442. 24]. This aman [2442. 24-2442. 40]. For example [2442. 40-2442. 76]. You are on the one side [2442. 76-2443. 50]. Excellent for [2443. 50-2444. 44]. The United States to erto [2444. 44-2445. 64].
