The following is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs:. It is a pleasure to be invited to the General Manager of ASRock. General Manager Xu will explain to you. General Manager Xu: Mr. Hui: Mr. Hui. As always, we will first give a brief description of the company's relevant figures. General Manager Xu: There will be a general manager's question in the future.

General manager Xu: That will leave a lot of time for you to do Q&A. General manager Xu: This year's talk is different from the past, our company will have a more power supply product line. General manager Xu: The hope is that in the past two years, the performance of the esports monitor and the Power Supply part of the performance of the company is slow so that the company can continue to grow steadily.

In the fourth quarter, the company's total revenue of 92.100 million, and YOY was the record high. Mr. Xu: The whole growth YOY is 64% growth. In terms of the main growth momentum, we talk about YOY from the point of view of Q4, in addition to TaxTab is a recession, other product lines have significant growth. Mr. Xu: The main growth momentum is derived from the more familiar understanding of the server, that is, in particular, AI Server, this part of the growth momentum is the strongest. Mr. Xu: The second is like our VGA, there is also a double-digit growth.

Monitor has a relatively small machine, and its growth is relatively large. General Manager: Monoball is a digit growth. TaxTab's Monoball and IPC is a YOY that presents a digit growth. General Manager: TaxTab is a downward trend. In general, the gross profit portion of the total gross profit, 4.23 billion YOY is only 10% growth. General Manager: This is mainly because the gross profit rate has dropped from 23%.

The main influence factor is the change in the product portfolio. Mr. Hui: The entire product portfolio in Q4 is a record high of 92.100 million, but its main growth momentum is from AI Server and VGA. Mr. Hui: The AI Server and VGA two product lines are relatively low based on a margin in the company's current product line. Mr. Hui: So the two relatively large growth momentum, which leads to revenue growth, but also leads to a significant decline in our gross profit margin. Mr. Hui: This part is based on AI Server, which is the biggest impact on AI Server.

There are three main reasons for the growth of business expenses: one is mainly our personnel expense, because the whole YOY speaking, we have increased the number of people in East China. Xu General Manager: some of our R&D team number, so the total number of people in the company has a single-digit growth. Xu General Manager: the other part of that, because of the increase in profits, so the cost of the entire staff division will also be increased accordingly. Xu General Manager: In addition to the personnel expense, the other two more important additions are our so-called material cost, the development cost of the product.

Mr. Xu: So its research and development costs will be relatively higher. The second is the advertising and marketing costs. Mr. Xu: In the past, the whole Huaqin is mainly the MARBLE, so the more and more products we see today, so the company in this part of the advertising. Mr. Xu: The entire contribution to the whole product is more obvious, so the company in the course of the two years, the advertising costs will be more positive. Mr. Xu: The whole business outside the part, 47 million is mainly interest income, there is a small portion of exchange income. Mr. Xu: It is very different from last year, because there is a relatively obvious exchange loss, so the whole industry, the outside part, compared to the last year has been significantly improved.

Mr. Xu: The net profit of the entire tax after 4.1.2 billion, the EPS is 3.34. Mr. Xu: That's what you said all year round, 202425 billion revenue, and YOY is 35% growth. Mr. Xu: That's what all the product lines look like, and there is only one best type down, and the rest of the product lines are all YOY growth. Mr. Xu: The growth rate is similar to just, mainly our SERVER, and the next one is VGA.

Mr. Xu: The gross profit margin is 20 to 19, which is similar to that of last year's gross profit margin. Mr. Xu: However, the whole year is relatively small, because the company has more professional inventory blocked in 2023. Mr. Xu: In fact, in 2023, if the inventory is blocked, the gross profit in 2023 should be a bit better. Mr. Xu: So the whole gross profit will still be affected by the change in the product portfolio. Mr. Xu: If the operating fee is 3.2 billion, then YOY is 19% growth. Mr. Xu: This part is the main factor, as reported recently, one is an increase in personnel costs.

General Manager Xu: The second is the material market cap fee, then the third is the advertising fee. General Manager Xu: the outside part of the industry because there is a change in the exchange income, coupled with the interest rate of the US dollar throughout the year is a big change. General Manager Xu: in fact, it is relatively better, so the relative deposit, interest income is relatively high. General Manager Xu: So 2.7 billion is mainly from interest income, followed by exchange income. General Manager Xu: the whole company last year, belongs to 12.9 9 YOY growth 40. General Manager Xu: that EPS10. 5. per share.

Xu General Manager: In terms of the entire asset structure, the company's asset structure has always been relatively simple. Xu General Manager: mainly three parts, namely, cash revenue accounts and inventory. Xu General Manager: That the cash portion, 35.80 million to last year has grown. Xu General Manager: But if the fixed deposit comes in, we probably have about 4.8 billion at the end of last year. Xu General Manager: 48 billion of cash is in fact equivalent to last year.

Mr. Xu: That's about 10 billion dollars, mainly because it's about to include the back, because there are several relatively large ones in the fourth quarter of last year. Mr. Xu: One is the demand for AI or the comparison, and the other is the introduction of new products to Modepod and VGA. Mr. Xu: So at the end of December last year, these three things we need to be more positive in the preparation. Mr. Xu: So this part of the inventory is based on the current situation, because this year, we still think the demand is a bit hot.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to sort out the provided transcription fragments into paragraph transcripts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription content provided. It looks like this is a financial and business-related meeting record, involving multiple aspects such as VGA card, AMD product, inventory management, short-term borrowing, cash flow, product line performance, etc.

First of all, I will check every entry in a sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the fragments provided by the user have some timestamps, such as [463. 82-465. 82], which need to be removed in the final output. Then, I need to group these separate sentences based on the subject and logical relationship to form a natural paragraph. For example, the parts of VGA cards and AMD products can be merged into a paragraph, followed by discussions on stock and short-term borrowings, and then cash flow and product line performance.

For example, when discussing the transition from financial data to product line performance, it may be necessary to insert a transition sentence, but the user requests not to be rewritten, so it can only be achieved by a reasonable segmentation. During the processing process, I also pay attention to the order of the original text, as timestamps may suggest the order of the speech. For example, the part of the VGA card is forward, followed by stock and short-term borrowing, and then the cash flow and product line outlook.

In addition, there are some repetitive or similar content in the segments provided by the users, such as AMD and Intel competition in the mainboard market, as well as the situation in the European market. These need to be classified separately into the corresponding paragraphs to avoid confusion. At the same time, pay attention to the correct use of professional terms, such as "YOY", "QOQ", etc., to ensure that the contents remain accurate after finishing. Finally, after completing the preliminary segmentation, I will read the whole finishing content to check whether the user meets all the requirements: no sentences are deleted, keep the original intention, and the paragraphs are naturally smooth.

In summary, this process requires careful procedural processing, logical grouping, and strict follow-up user instructions to ensure that the final output meets the format requirements, but also maintains the integrity and accuracy of the original content. </think> The following is the collated paragraph procedural procedural procedural transcription (totally retain all the original sentences, only the semantic logical reorganization paragraphs): That VGA card is the part of the story, because AMD products currently, this new generation of products, market demand performance is not good, so we will be actively prepared. So the overall point of view, at least until the second quarter of this year, the whole inventory may change, compared with the relatively obvious decline, should be due to the relationship of performance, so we will be more actively forced.

In the case of cash flow, although the whole year 2024 cash flow is higher than the year 2023, but due to the impact of the entire inventory, resulting in the entire operation of cash flow, is actually less than the previous. The part of the investment activity, if deducting the measurement of assets after amortization, in fact, there is not much change, then the investment activity, in addition to the distribution of cash impact is relatively large, that last year, two additional factors, in addition to the last year, the addition of the two factors is just mentioned in the last year, because our subsidiary Yongqin new company to log in the new cabinet, the company needs to be allocated a certain amount as a new cabinet use, so this part is not because the relationship is determined by equity law, so it is not affected our last year's profit figures, only affect the number.

This is the trend of profitability, the whole profit trend, the current market rate is still going down in the fourth quarter, the main thing is to talk about the relationship between the product. Looking at the first quarter of the year we are going to see, because the whole product portfolio and the fourth quarter we are going to talk about, may not be very variable, so the whole overall look, because the entire Q1, AI server and VGA is a growth momentum is relatively strong, then the growth momentum is relatively weak, mainly because of the main product oil limit, the product comparison is less than expected, so this part may make its revenue relative growth momentum is more suppressed, so the overall overall, Q1, we think that the gross profit rate should be a slight fluctuation, may be a percentage point above the next one, may continue to look at the later.

In the first place, the motorboat part is about the motorboat, the motorboat part is now proportion to our company to revenue, because the service and VGT, the proportion of the VGT card is getting higher, so the motorboat proportion is now about 40% in principle. This year's point of view, Motorboat itself, alone to look at the number of growth, then the ASP may still be flat, then the current motherboard's business is very strong, on the channel AMD very strong Intel is very weak, especially the high-end part of AMD ate about about 90%, so Intel is a bit more difficult. Now looking at this situation should be the second half of this year, now we can not see how Intel Fight back, so we think about how much, but now we are more traditionally more favorable, just say that we are now production is a little bit slower, so we can expect some of the next time to the next year.

So this year, we think it's a digit growth, ASP seems to be flat, and the gross profit margin may be slightly lower.

This is the main part of the main board. Our company also has that part of the VGA section, VGA now looks upside down or optimistic, because now looks AMD's 9000 series 9070XT, March 6th is listed after the whole evaluation is not good, coupled with AMD's current talk or out of stock, so we think that this year AMD may be a little bit better in this share, so we think we are in this share is a little better, so because we are in the AMD INNER SHARE is also getting bigger and bigger here, so the whole Allocation is not good, that this year's VGA including REVENUE, will be a little bit more than we originally expected, this is the current situation.

In addition, we are going to start to say that we launched our own brand PROFIT in December last year, and after three months of this, it now looks like the United States and certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region to do a good job, then it looks like this year's POWER SUPPLY will be more than we expected last year's goal, then it will be super-standard, that SO FAR and POWER SUPPLY's gross profit margin is good, as long as the scale is enlarged, so now we have the opportunity to do so in the first year, so so we have to do it this year's POWER SUPPLY is also very good to us. The main purpose of our power SUPPLY to do MONITOR is to make it, and to say that we have a complete set of GAMEMING SOPPLY. This is just the way we have mentioned that we are now investing in marketing, when we put more products on the main board when we invest in marketing that CP Ratio will be better, then we are more willing to invest, because the REVERING BASE I see is more favorable for us, so it becomes said that we will be more favored in this Blending, so in the end of the GAMING system, we will find that board manufacturers or stand the most important position, including these components in the game system, we will find the board manufacturers or stand the most important position, including these components in the current version of these components we are working hard here, and we may later we will be more than those things that belong to the electrical aspects of the electronics component side, I think it is more likely than other PRO, because the board manufacturers have mastered the main board knowledge, so as long as well as the main board manufacturers in the main board manufacturers, so we will be willing to buy a new products, we will be in the next next product, we will be able to buy a new product, we will be to buy a new product, we will be in the brand brand brand brand, we will be in the new product, we will be to buy a new products, we will be in the brand brand brand brand brand, we will be the new product, we will be the next next next next next next product, we will be the brand new product, brand brand brand brand brand new product, we will be the brand brand new product, we will be the brand new product, we will will be the brand brand brand, we will be the brand brand brand, we will will will will will be the brand, we will will be the brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand new product, we will will will will will will will be the brand new product, we will be the brand, we will be the brand, we will be the brand brand, we will will will be the brand new product, we will we will be the next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next next product, brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand brand, we will be we will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will will be we will be the brand new product, we will will will will be So we see that the increase in ASRock's own overhead mainly comes from two, one is that our new product is now invested in the need for manpower, the other is our sales marketing HACK COUNT increase, this is the most important, of course, because the PROBIT more after the proportion of employee dividends is directly increased, this is not only because of the R&D, MARBLE or VGA, in fact, we have new products we enhance our SALES MARKETING, and that is the SALES OF FORCE, we have opened a small office in many places, and then there are more SALES, and this is the ability of MARKETING, we have done this for years, in addition to new products including MONITOR including POWER SUPLY, and this is the ability of SALES MARKETING, this is the potential part of our investment, we are the part of China, we want to build this brand to compete with the main ASUS microstars in this market, now seems to slow and now appear to gradually to be successful when a new product.

Power Supply is a very good example of this. The above report is part of organizing Chinese dives. So Obama may see this year compared to last year, or is it just the truth. Especially in the case of VGA, I think this year's increase, the revenue of VGA will be more optimistic than last year's fourth quarter estimate.

IPC was a bit more difficult last year, and it looked like it was better in the second half of last year. National 191 was getting better and it didn't look good this year. There should still be a double-digit growth this year.

So we did a lot of investment on the system. So I think in the next two years, it will slowly back into the wine development. That thing is, the focus is that it is relatively, it is veryINDUSTRY, it is veryINDUSTRY ORIENTED. So the thing is, once you enter the market, you have a seat.

This year, we estimate that Double Digital will grow. That GROSS MARKET should be able to maintain, not too big a problem. I think it might be 2026, which is the part of my IPC. I will report to you about the SERVER. SERVER is traditionally divided into two, one is a traditional SERVER and one is an AI SERVER.

Our AI SERVER, in fact, has been reported to be last year's Q3, even Q3, Q2 began to ship small amounts of Q3 points, and then Q4 more. Q1 looks like it can maintain the MOMENTUM of Q4, Q2 should have some MOMENTUM. That's part of AI, so we're talking about AI this year's AI should be a stable growth for us. That is, compared to 2024, we can, we are hoping to use Q4 as a GUIDANCE last year's Q4 as a Q2 SO FAR to see this as a QUARTER BASE.

The main focus of our Q2 is to go to V200, H200 and V200 to Q3. That over this year, most of us will still be in this so-called H series and V series. As for the cost of packaging, etc., the GV200 GV300 will be a bit slower, because it is the whole cabinet thing. Most of us are in the T21 CSP, and we are a bit slower.

Because most of the G200 REPLACEMENT is the super large data center, not the same as the general data center, or the small and medium-sized CSP's replacement, not yet to the GV200 GV300. For us, this year is probably the year, or the H series and the V series are the main. SO FAR looks like that, the DEMAN is still, we think we are still STABILIZED. So this is the part of AI.

We have a number of new customers, compared to medium and large for us, compared to medium and large customers, he has some projects to import in the third quarter. So in the traditional SERVER above the third quarter of the fourth quarter will see a relatively large growth. The first half of the year may be the same as last year, the average last year was about the average.

As for the gross profit margin, the chief financial officer reported that PRECIMATCH could be a bit of a problem because of the CONFINATION problem. OBOR said that we felt that this year compared to last year, it seems like a lot but still optimistic. The above is to report to you, so if you have any questions, welcome to come up with it. Well, thank you. We are now talking about the product that paid for the money, our main board was originally produced outside of China, and I am talking about selling to the United States. Our main board was originally produced outside the mainland, so this part has not been paid and has not been affected so far.

As for the VGA card, we have moved from February to Vietnam, which should be in February. Therefore, the land began to produce and sell U.S. products in Vietnam, and the board is relatively unaffected.

AGE AI's O3 model. This company uses this model. Then it launched its AGE AI solution company with this model. Generally speaking, their software engineer doesn't have much energy. So they're still talking about it. It's very much on CUDA.

The CUDA relies heavily on the top of the CUDA, so it turns out that everyone wants to enter this market. The most important thing to MD for Intel is the compatibility of their software. How much can they do?

I don't think it's a problem with hardware. It's software compatibility. Because of the target object, the workstation target object is a small company. It's not a big company.

So there is no one to do it. Specialize in doing it for two sets. Set for CUDA set for AMD set for Intel. He won't want to do it. Process it. So it turns out that AMD is talking about Intel.

And when he had finished, he went to the place where he was, and went to the place where he was; and the place where he was; and the place where he was, and the place where he was; and the place where he was, and the place where he was, and the place where he was, and the place where he was, and the place where he was.

Not a problem. This is now the challenge of AMD and Intel. That workstation. To get up, put a lot of talk. It should be here.

The biggest market in the short term can be seen in the mainland. I think it may be until the second half. Maybe until the second half of the year. It will be the same currency to buy for a lifetime. Maybe it will be a lifetime. Or people will repeat it.

punk corrected The size of the company we currently have in our community. To be honest, we can only do it. T23 T24 There are some T22s.

He said he really wanted to do a lot. Frankly, I don't have any money. It's because you're buying that money. You're doing a lot of big things and taking a billion dollars out of it. Put it on the table to play. I can't do that.

As for the risk you are talking about. We are talking about it right now. Most of us are TDInvent. Most of us are more conservative in the AI community. Most of us are TDInvent.

We do not have any tags for If You Were A Boy [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics.

We will be careful. That's what AI is talking about right now. We all have to pay for it first. We will pay for it. This is the moment.

We have been blessed with a lot of good things to do, but most of them have been blessed with a lot of good things to do, and we have not been blessed with a lot of good things to do.

We have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first, we have to do this first.

We need to do this first. I feel that their niche is. It will eventually become the one that is present. There are also many T2 T3s. Web hosting company has some CSPs. So their niche is that he says he compares Niche.

Then he was more flexible. It might not be that flexible. It might not be that flexible. It might be that big CSP is willing to deal with it. I think his market is perfect.

Probably 9 to 1. Always 9 to 1. He won't see that one. But he says. He's not in a main battlefield. He's probably always 9 to 1.

I feel like this is how it is right now. 8 to 2 9 to 1 This is probably the case. I feel these replays. The preceding is said to be the licensure of Taiwan.

I'm sorry, I'm just a little late for my Mv lever, but I'm asking. I don't really work at all.

Because I'm just checking. We're just checking. We're on the page. We're looking at it. You've got this desk membrane. favorites function is preloaded.

And he said unto him, Behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come; and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come; and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come; and behold, I am come; and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come, and behold, I am come.

This phone a lot. Listen to you talk about it. Q1 and Q2 and after. The server of this piece of Momentum. Can be more than you can see from the fourth quarter. A foundation to look at.

It is not a matter of growing up. It is not a matter of growing up. It is not a matter of growing up. It is a matter of absolute value. The momentum is relatively stable.

There will be four quarters this year. The relatively large difference is still there. I feel that the four quarters may be stable. It may not be very large. The upside down side is not necessarily. It may not be true.

OK thanks. I'd like to add a reason. Because it's a bit high price for AI right now, so if we're like. The most obvious difference in January 1 February.

In January, the revenue surged. In fact, a large part of the customers came from February, and the relationship of pre-loaded goods was just right, and the general manager mentioned that we were talking about.

In general, such a situation should be maintained. However, if the customer has advance or delay the shipment, especially at the end of the end of the season, it may affect the number more obvious. This is possible.

[2197. 42-2203. 42] The AGE AI O3's model. [2195. 42-2203. 42] The company used this model to adopt this model company. [2197. 42-2203. 42] Then the use of this model launched its AGE AI solution company. [2203. 42-2209. 42] Their software engineers have not had much energy. [2209. 42-2211. 42] So they are still talking about it. [2211. 42-2213. 42] They are on top of CUDA.

[2213. 42-2215. 42] is based on CUDA. [2215. 42-2217. 42] turns out to be something everyone wants to enter the market. [2217. 42-2219. 42] The most important thing for MD is to talk about Intel.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. Risks still exist. But if we look at the whole quarter of overall, this momentum will be more stable. However, you may see a relatively large fluctuation in the month.

Since there is no AI server before, but now there is a lot more, so we are not going to look at it, at least, that this year, maybe this 15% is the norm. Because your AI server is too large, after the whole branch becomes larger, this Gross margin may be a bit more difficult to go back to the past. Because that VGA here is also relatively large, but Gross margin actually looks like a similar phenomenon. So I don't know if this 15% is likely to be like this year or maybe 2026, so it's probably the most difficult to go back to 20.

In the future, the gross profit margin should be based on Q4, which may be a slight Q1 estimate, but the probability of a slight increase will be slightly higher. This is mainly due to the high season of some consumer products, when the proportion of consumer products began to rise, his margin will be increased.

The last influence factor is that the general purpose of the whole server, margin, in fact, is going to decline, but if we divide it into two parts, the general purpose in the past three years, he actually has been growing up. This part is what we want in this section if we can think of something more important than just General Manager to mention that some customers have a relatively large amount of production, and that part of the gross margin will also have some significant improvement. Please ask the general manager of the motherboard, just mentioned that there is the worst situation in China, how do you see the current market, and how do you think it is because there has been a recent conversation with some customers in China, so it seems that the economy outside of the mainland is worse, and then Mr.

So you say that the US-China trade war could be worse, but we don't think we're going to go that direction. In this case, the overall consumption of all aspects of China's mainland itself should be going up and down, and it won't be possible to go down again. You can also see that after deep-seek, his entire stock market and other aspects of investment have also started to become more positive.

That's what we think. OK That's what I mentioned in my careify number is just that it's really strong, and then it's not 10 quarters. YY doesn't say YY is base, but it's supposed to be 64% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. So if we look at Q1 this year, we think Q1 should be higher if we think Q2 is a relatively high probability.

However, some of the models may not be able to be avoided. So the Q4 should be a slight decline in the trend. Then the reason is that the third and fourth quarters and the high season of consumer products are starting to drive, so the Server section includes the General Purpose and AI here should have some opportunity to go up and down again. Then, combined with the IPC in the second half of the year, it seems that the performance should be better than the first half of the year. So overall to look at this, the whole time we think we need to maintain a YY growth momentum in the future from the first quarter to the third quarter of this year.

So continue to maintain such a positive growth momentum.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user, convert it from a verbatim format to a paragraph while not deleting anything. First, I want to read the rules of the user carefully to ensure that the task requirements are fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the original intention and structure. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like a discussion about a company's financial strategy involving payout ratios, working capital needs, investment plans, and the impact of the U.S. market.

For example, the first sentence is "should be a relatively high probability," and the next one is "so just mentioned should be such a trend." These two sentences are obviously in the same paragraph, discussing a trend with a higher probability. Therefore, I need to consolidate them into a paragraph, separated in the middle with spaces, but keep the original sentence intact. Next, deal with the part about dividend payout rates.

For example, from "now seeing the payout of the dividend this year" to "afterward it is not likely to maintain a relatively low payout," these sentences discuss the changes in payout and should be merged into a paragraph. Then it is a part of working capital needs and investment plans. The user mentions that working capital demand is strong, the company may invest, and the future payout ratio will increase. These content need to be segmented to ensure that each topic forms separate paragraphs, but keep the original order.

This section requires the integration of relevant sentences, such as from "Then Expo to that USA" to "Shouldn't", to form a paragraph that illustrates the small impact of the U.S. market. It is important to note that there may be timestamp intervals between some sentences, but depending on the content to determine whether it belongs to the same paragraph.

In addition, there are some repetitive or affirmative sentences in the transcripts provided by the user, such as 'to', 'to' and 'to', which should not be carefully calculated', which need to be kept in the original position to maintain the natural flow of the dialogue. Finally, check the entire converted paragraph transcripts to ensure that there is no missing any sentences, all the contents are arranged in the original order, and that the paragraphs are logically divided and coherent. At the same time, make sure that there are no additional content or modifications to the original sentences, fully meet the requirements of the user. </think>

Now we see that this year's dividend payout is probably different from the past. That's probably because it's high growth. That's because you just mentioned that the value of the chip is quite high. Then it's not because the past payout is very high.

This year seems to look like around 50%. It's not likely that we'll be able to maintain a relatively low payout or maybe we'll make up for the capital we need. Pout may have a chance to improve a little. The payout ratio should be a little more important this year because the demand for working capital just mentioned is still strong.

That's why this part of the capital kinetics will continue. That's why we bought a new plant in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of last year together with last year's talk. So we may have some potential investment opportunities in the future for some of our investments.

In the future, the probability of raising the payout ratio should be relatively higher. The other is that the bank finance is mainly a permanent job. If we plan to have a smooth IPO, he should be able to raise a portion of the capital raised there before the IPO, as well as the growth of his business.

So it is possible to maintain this level a little in a short period of time. However, it is possible to expect that the latter or return to 70% of the payout ratio is the current idea. Then Expo to the USA is a product line regardless of the overall proportion of the consolidate is made in China product and then shipped to the USA. If this part of the consolidated report looks at me to see if I should be less than 10% of the revenue less than 10% of the merchandise line should not be carefully calculated.

It is a pity that because of the care of time, we have some other guests who have doubts in the section of scout.
