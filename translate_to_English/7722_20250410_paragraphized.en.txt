In addition, we have a 100% owned subsidiary LinePay Plus in Korea. You should also see in the news that our company plans to apply for an electronic payment license, and we have already submitted an application to the competent authority. In the future, we expect to set up a subsidiary of our 100% owned subsidiary to specialize in LinePay's electronic payment.

First, the B2B2C payment business, which we all know, is the business of making payments to merchants through QR. In the case of reward cards and co-branded cards, the issuance of credit cards can accumulate LinePoint's credit card business. The ticket issuance business refers to LinePay's role as a ticket issuer, integrating multiple partner stores' tickets on LinePay's platform, providing consumers with a variety of discount tickets.

The company's 2024 key financial indicators, first is the operating performance, one of the most important indicators for our company is the transaction volume, transaction volume reflects not only the actual active performance of users through LinePay, but also our operating performance and revenue model. We also have a very important indicator is our operating performance, which is also driving our company's revenue growth, expanding the user base and operating scale, which is also the key data that can reflect customer satisfaction, and it is also the key data that can reflect customer satisfaction.

The number of cards the user binds to in our app is more than 1.5 million cards. This number accounts for about one-third of the number of cards in circulation in Taiwan.

Our cooperation chain has more than 610,000, our cooperation chain has more than 610,000, and this number is 3.5 times the largest acquirer in Taiwan, and the number is 3.5 times the largest acquirer in Taiwan.



Here is a re-arranged, paragraph-based transcript:. Continue to invest in resources to support our future growth. The competition in the payment industry is fierce, but we not only continue to create high revenues, but also maintain a steady profit. This shows that our business model is correct and has potential.

In the future, we will continue to move forward in this direction. The following is the ROE, the return on equity. As the basic company handles the previous cash increase last year, the increase in shareholders' equity leads to a technical downturn in the ROE of the current period.

Finally, this page is a summary of our balance sheet, as of the end of 2024, our total assets reached 167 billion yuan, an annual increase of about 31%. This mainly comes from the inflow of cash capital and the steady inflow of working capital, which makes our current assets grow steadily. At the same time, our total debt dropped to 6.4 billion yuan, and the debt ratio further fell to 38%, reflecting the company's financial structure more stable.

Thank you all for listening. Thanks for sharing with Rafi. Next, I would like to tell you about our future career outlook for LINEPay.

This is our corporate vision of LINEPay, as consumers are everywhere, and through our LinePay ecosystem, users can have a convenient and secure shopping experience. We also hope that merchants can use our platform to gain more business opportunities and make life better. Since 2015, LinePay has not only provided payment services, but we have gradually expanded our business to point-back card platforms, ticket distribution platforms, financial industry cooperation platforms and advertising marketing platforms. We will continue to generate stable revenue and profit, and in the end 2021, we have achieved an annual profit balance, and continue to create profits every year.

In addition to the successful listing, we launched Outbound and cross-border payment business to actively explore the Korean market. In summary, we are now going to deepen the domestic market and expand our corporate strategy to the two cores of the overseas market, and continue to expand our company's business as a whole. That is to tell you about our domestic market first. In the domestic market, we aim to lead the development of the whole payment market, continuously optimize our services, drive our growth and expand our profit model. The second part is our overseas market, because we already have successful experience in Taiwan, so we want to copy the successful model to overseas, through the realization of cross-border inbound and outbound services, to enhance the overall trading volume of LinePay.

Our goal is to continuously optimize the relevant features to drive existing business and new business development. With third-party payment business as an example, we have now achieved some results in this business, but by deepening the functionality of LinePay, we want to continue to expand our business landscape.

In order to avoid confusion, we also want to emphasize that the cooperation of financial promotion refers to our credit card, and then the cooperation of the financial industry refers to our intermediaries insurance, loans and other financial products. Therefore, LinePay wants to work in this financial industry, in addition to existing insurance credit cards and loans, to further extend this program to banks and securities, and start a new cooperation model with financial partners.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and sort it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to make sure that not all sentences are deleted, not rewritten, not condensed in anything. User emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them one by one, and make sure that there are no omissions. Next, I look at the transcription fragments provided and notice that there are a lot of timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order, while keeping the order and content of the original sentences. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, such as a continuous statement or question section, which needs to be merged together.

First of all, I will deal with the beginning. For example, from the beginning of the "and according to our GRI" to the end of the "implementation of corporate social responsibility", these sentences are about company reporting and transparency, and should be merged into a paragraph. Then the end of the language section, such as "that presentation today is over" to "thank you for listening", these can be combined into a paragraph.

It is important to note that some sentences may be duplicated or formatted, such as "generally speaking" multiple times, may need to be checked for incorrect input, but according to user requirements, cannot be deleted or modified, so it must be retained. In addition, the blank part of the timestamp (such as 1975. 26-1975. 78, etc.) may indicate speech recognition errors or blanks, but the original sentence must also be retained.

In addition, be aware of the transition between Q&A, such as "Okay, that third question we came here" to "Then we came here", these transitions need to be correctly classified into the corresponding Q&A section. At the same time, some sentences may belong to different parts of the same answer, and need to be combined to maintain fluency. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph type verbatim to ensure that no sentence is missing and paragraphs are logically separated. At the same time, check whether there is a format error, if the timestamp corresponds correctly, but the user may need to have timestamps in the final output, so the user may need to remove the timestamps, but the user does not explicitly explain, so it is necessary to confirm.

To sum up, my steps are: 1. Read and identify paragraphs in a row; 2. merge consecutive sentences into appropriate paragraphs; 3. maintain the original sequence and content; 4. check and ensure that all sentences are correctly included; 5. Final collated into a coherent paragraph-based transcription.

If you are unable to reply in time due to time constraints, the management team will communicate with you after the meeting. You can submit the completed question form to the field staff, Q&A will reply the question form, the question form will be completed in order, and then open the field questions. When opening the field questions, please return to us, the staff will submit the microphone for you to speak.

The first question is, from the news to see that your company has submitted an e-application, what will be the change in strategy if the company expects to hold the power of some areas after passing? The first question is, is this question related to our e-payment? We hope that the person in charge of our payment will help us to answer it. Well, thank you for your inquiry.

I would also like to mention that we have electronic payments, if the competent authority is able to allow, what will be the benefit of our future services and operations. I think Taiwan's electronic payments should also be more than 67 years old, I think you should also understand that Taiwan's electronic payments laws and regulations for what functions, mainly for transfer, there are wallets can be paid out, there are drawings and transactions, and of course there are some overseas transactions or can be done.

However, it is also important to report this to the supervisor of the final review of the opinion of the Lord, and to explain it to you in the first place.

Generally speaking, generally speaking, generally speaking, generally speaking.

He is the Lord of the Rings, and He is the Lord of the Rings.

Vladimir. How will the company create good value for investors in this market change? Answer these questions. I will answer them. Well, this question is answered by Mr. Ding, our chairman. We are also worried about the uncertain parts of the market, but we believe that we can provide investors with a balanced income and value in the short term, and the best way is to compensate the investor by adding value.

In this case, we want to build a non-disruptive corporate value by conducting internal growth and professional risk management, and we will try our best to provide investor trust and continue to check various solutions and continue to execute. Well, we are also very worried about the recent international political instability, but this, LiPay is a stable business foundation and continues to grow, and the Chairman believes that we can bring stable income and value to investors in the medium and long term.

The third question is, what is the company's idea of stock price this year? Why is it only 1.5 pieces this year? We're here. These questions Raffi will answer. Well, that's the question we ask our finance director, Raffi, to wait for the answer.

This year, we decided to issue a cash dividend of $1.5 per share, because the distribution ratio is about 17%. This decision reflects our company's capital allocation strategy at the stage of ongoing growth, and is based on our estimates of future capital needs. This year, including the establishment of new subsidiaries, the construction of Taiwan data centers and the development of new services, in the future we will be flexible to adjust our strategy according to market opportunities and business needs.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [2388. 34-2492. 34] I would like to know if such a situation will have an impact on your company? [2392. 34-2394. 34] Question four. [2394. 34-2399. 34] The Trump relations policy is now under excavation uncertainty. [2399. 34-2402. 34] The main market is growing.

[2402. 34-2403. 34] So if this is the case, what do you think about it? [2403. 34-2405. 34] Do you have any impressions? [2405. 34-2407. 94] Your company's external factors. [2407. 94-2409. 94] What is the impact. [2409. 94-2411. 94] What are the external factors of your company?

[2411. 94-2414. 94] This is the answer I came to. [2418. 94-2420. 94] Our company was in the domestic market at the time. [2420. 94-2422. 94] The company that carried out the results. [2422. 94-2424. 94] Although we are now abroad. [2424. 94-2426. 94] During the period of growth in the results. [2426. 94-2428. 94] But there is still a considerable portion.

[2428. 94-2430. 94] Growth base in the domestic market. [2430. 94-2432. 94] And we are not manufactured or manufactured items. [2432. 94-2434. 94] As an output base company. [2434. 94-2436. 94] We think that the tariff policy of the United States has changed. [2438. 94-2440. 94] The direct impact on the parties.

[2440. 94-2442. 94] The possibility is very low. [2442. 94-2444. 94] In addition, the current change. [2444. 94-2446. 94] is due to international investment psychology. [2446. 94-2448. 94] Definition and periodic phenomena. [2448. 94-2450. 94] does not affect the basis of the parties. [2450. 94-2452. 94] or actual goals.

[2452. 94-2454. 94] We will continue. [2454. 94-2456. 94] Keep an eye on the market situation. [2456. 94-2458. 94] And with the market expansion and stability. [2458. 94-2460. 94] The impact of the target. [2460. 94-2462. 94] Thank you. [2490. 94-2492. 94] We will also pay attention to others.

[2492. 94-2494. 94] Change in the market. [2494. 94-2496. 94] and focus on our business. [2496. 94-2498. 94] Business expansion of amateur development. [2498. 94-2500. 94] and robust business operations. [2500. 94-2502. 94] to ensure that the company can continue to develop steadily. [2502. 94-2504. 94] Thank you.

[2504. 94-2506. 94] Okay, then we're going to question five. [2506. 94-2508. 94] question five. [2508. 94-2510. 94] is about business expansion. [2510. 94-2512. 94] and business expansion. [2512. 94-2514. 94] We want to mention. [2514. 94-2516. 94] is the beginning.

[2516. 94-2518. 94] Performance of social quality. [2518. 94-2520. 94] We are reinforced. [2520. 94-2539. 02] Five questions. [2550. 94-2556. 02] Now I ask you, how will you change the habits of these people? [2556. 02-2559. 66] Or, as just as they say,

[2559. 66-2565. 82] Will Taiwanese or Japanese travel exclusively abroad? [2565. 82-2569. 62] And increase travel costs? [2569. 62-2572. 62] I hope you will answer these questions. [2577. 90-2580. 22] I now ask you, how will you change the habits of these people?

[2590. 30-2590. 30] We will look for some other financial partners, [2590. 30-2596. 10] or other investment strategies... [2596. 10-2597. 46] Very bad. [2597. 46-2600. 10] We will look for some local financial partners.

[2600. 10-2603. 62] or some of the partners we can work with, [2603. 62-2607. 46] go together to solve this problem. [2607 46-2610. 18] Like Korean, we found a letter card, [2610. 18-2612. 18] or a modern card, [2612. 18-2616. 18] and let these habits use some of the users of the LINE APP. [2616. 18-2619. 18]

[2619. 18-2624. 18] Make use of their own APPs in Taiwan for consumption. [2624. 18-2626. 18] If other countries, of course we should have other strategies. [2629. 18-2631. 18] Whether Japan or Thailand, [2631. 18] These countries are LINE countries. [2633. 18-2635. 18] These countries can be imagined.

[2635. 18-2638. 18] But if it goes to the third and fourth countries, [2638. 18-2639. 18] We will use the local way of consumption, [2639. 18-2640. 18] We will use the local way of consumption, [2640. 18-2641. 18] We will use the local way of consumption, [2641. 18-2644. 18] Or the habits of users, [2644. 18-2648. 18] We will lead our overall trading volume to rise.

[2648. 18-2649. 18] Thank you. [2649. 18-2650. 18] Thank you. [2650. 18-2657. 18] Good. [2657. 18-2660. 18] Sixth question. [2660. 18-2664. 18] Six questions in total are five questions. [2660. 18-2666. 18] So let's take a look.

[2666. 18-2667. 18] The sixth question has five small questions. [2667. 18-2668. 18] Let's take a closer look. [2668. 18-2669. 18] The sixth question has five small questions. [2669. 18-2671. 18] Let's take a closer look. [2671. 18-2672. 18] First, the Taiwan market is smaller than the rest of the world. [2672. 18-2673. 18] Second, the Taiwan market is smaller than the rest of the world.

[2673. 18-2678. 18] Future if orientation saturation,. [2678. 18-2679. 18] Is future revenue growth slowing? [2679. 18-2681. 18] Is future revenue growth slowing? [2681 18-2683. 18] First question.

[2683. 18-2685. 18] The mass of Taiwan market is smaller compared to other countries. [2685. 18-2686. 18] The mass of Taiwan market is smaller compared to the mass of other countries. [2686. 18-2689. 18] So if this quantitative state becomes so in the future, [2689. 18-2690. 18] If this quantitative state becomes so in the future, will our profits and growth be slightly slower if our market is neutral?

[2697. 18-2701. 18] We are now answering the questions. [270. 18-2705. 18] We begin to answer these questions. [2712. 18-2719. 18] Of course, the size of the Taiwan market may be larger than the market in which the Taiwan market is located. [2719. 18-2725. 18] However, the Taiwan market we are currently looking at is not very small. [2725. 18-2733. 18] We have also proposed that the profit and growth in the Taiwan market is still very high.

[2733. 18-2738. 18] Basically, we have proposed that we can grow more than 10 times. [2741. 18-2748. 18] First, from the overall market size of Taiwan, of course, compared with other countries, of course. [2748. 18-2749. 18] The absolute value may be very low. [2749. 18-2756. 18] However, from the company's perspective, we do not think that Taiwan's market size is very small. [2756. 18-2762. 18] We have also shared with other night markets before. [2762. 18-2767. 18] The company believes that there is still a lot of room for growth in the market in Taiwan.

[2767. 18-2774. 18] There are 10 times the potential to grow in the consumer market as a whole. [2774. 18-2778. 18] But, then, in the future times,. [2778. 18-2784. 18] We may see some people want to think about the market conditions, [2784. 18-2787. 18] Or if we want to think about the market conditions, [2787. 18-2789. 18] In this case, we can. [2789. 18-2791. 18] Explains what we can do.

[2791. 18-2793. 18] There are two ways. [2793. 18-2798. 18] First, we can study the current market situation even more. [2798. 18-2802. 18] Second, we can grow the field of our market. [2802. 18-2805. 18] For the purpose of studying the market more, our industry must be more in depth. [2805. 18-2807. 18] Therefore, we have introduced two important growth strategies this year.

[2812. 18-2815. 18] There is also the part where we can grow the market, [2815. 18-2818. 18] Because we have been in Taiwan for a long time, [2818. 18-2821. 18] We need to implement this process in another field. [2821. 18-2823. 18] Therefore, we need more time. [2823. 18-2827. 18] Therefore, we started this industry's transmission base, [2827. 18-2831. 18] First, we are in the process of external transmission.

[2831. 18-2833. 18] If we can do so, [2833. 18-2835. 18] We can say, we can say. [2835. 18-2837. 18] We can combine this market with the external market. [2837. 18-2839. 18] Together and together, this form of combination will become a new market, [2842. 18-2844. 18]

[2844. 18-2848. 18] And we will continue to expand the market growth. [2848. 18-2850. 18] Well, that's the case. [2850. 18-2852. 18] Of course, at a certain point in time in the future, of course. [2852. 18-2856. 18] It may be possible that just what we have to say about the people we ask. [2856. 18-2858. 18] It is the saturation of the market. [2858. 18-2860. 18]

[2860. 18-2863. 18] In the company's position, we can take a strategy that is divided into two major parts. [2863. 18-2864. 18] In the company's position, we can take a strategy that is divided into two major parts. [2864. 18-2866. 18] The first part is that we continue in our existing business, [2866. 18-2870. 18] The first part is that we continue in our existing business. [2870. 18-2872. 18] We continue to explore and continue to explore the possibility of growth. [2872. 18-2874. 18] We continue to explore the possibility of growth.

[2874. 18-2876. 18] And the second is to expand our business. [2876. 18-2878. 18] And the second is to expand our business. [2878. 18-2880. 18] The second part, as we have mentioned in the briefing today, is just as we have mentioned in the briefing today. [2880. 18-2884. 18] The first is to continue to explore the growth potential of existing businesses. [2884. 18-2886. 18] The first is to explore the growth potential of existing businesses.

[2886 18-2888. 18] The first is to discover the growth potential of an existing business.

We need to deepen our existing business. Just as we have been executive vice president Gloria mentioned in the briefing, just as we have been executive vice president Gloria mentioned in the briefing, we will continue to optimize our services, we will continue to optimize our services, and then deepen our business in this market in Taiwan.

This part, of course, will take more time to promote the business, but it will also be a driving force for our future growth. But it will also be a driving force for our future growth. That is, while we develop our overseas business, at the same time we develop our overseas business, and at the same time we continue to deepen our domestic business.

Well, let's take a look at the third question. The third question is, your company has the right time.

Second, the second question. Does the overseas expansion mean that the target to come to Taiwan, the overseas expansion, or the target to set up LinePay payment methods for travelers, tourists, and overseas, rather than extending the business model to other regions? Instead of extending the business model to other regions? The second question is, for us, you only expand the business model for travelers in Taiwan, or overseas LinePay payment methods for overseas, I think that this is not the new expansion version is not in the expansion of the new version in other regions.

That's what we're doing now, and we're seeing everyone interested in setting up a data center, so please ask them to answer the IDC fee plan for IDC related issues. There are a lot of questions you've asked about this topic, can you explain that you can explain the discussion about that? Well, if you're interested in that IDC fee, please let us know.

Well, the IDC is continuing to build this year, which is this year, the total capital expenditure invested this year, we are currently estimated to be within 200 million, but because this is a factory construction, so the relevant costs will be able to go through many years of amortization, so the impact rate of our monthly cost this year.

We don't think we're going to be too big for our initial decision. Then IDC is because it's our first build this year, so there are some initial costs. That's going to be back to what I just said. In fact, the monthly fees are based on our internal information. Our revenue share isn't really that big.

혹시 추가의 , Well, again, I would like to share with you all the relevant overseas issues. Because you want to know now that we have done cross-border in South Korea for a while, I want to know what kind of speed is growing. What is the next cross-border strategy?

I have a question about this one, so I'd like to ask.

First of all, we made a little budget for the Korean tourism company. We asked if the growth is growing, whether it is growing, we asked these questions. Then if the growth of Korea is good, then the next goal is how.

Or have a new strategy. We want to know the questions. So I want everyone to answer these questions. Well, thank you, I'll answer you. Well, that's the same as our chairman's reply.

First, we set up the Korean market, we really didn't succeed, we took a year's effort. Although we took a year, it didn't show up in the market. But now it's the beginning of 2025.

So we can say that the period of success is ongoing. And now in the Korean market, the expansion of LinePay users, mainly large brands, large brands of users, are all in the center of the brand,

We have established partnerships with major business owners. Major business owners. These are the most popular industries. And in all industries, our industry growth and growth are very good.

It is a good thing to be a part of this world, and to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, to be a part of it, and to be a part of it.

The Qur'an is the word of Allah, the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original data of the user carefully to ensure that the sentences corresponding to each timestamp are understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure there are no omissions or duplicates. For example, there are multiple timestamps in the fragments provided by the user, such as [3791. 54-3794. 32] The modern card area has already been working together, the next is [3794. 32-3796. 40] But here I want to tell you that these need to be arranged in order. Next, I need to merge these sentences into a natural and smooth paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, such as about the parts of the Korean market expansion, which may need to be merged together.

For example, the original data provided by the user may have some timestamps that may be wrongly separated and need to be verified correctly. For example, [4024. 54-4026. 58] Must be invested, followed by [4026. 58-4028. 90] To have a cost-effective item, the two sentences should be linked together to form a complete paragraph. Also, note that some sentences may be duplicated, such as "as expected" appeared several times, and need to remain the same, without any modification. At the same time, the user mentioned "LICENSE basically TSP LICENSE can do more extensive business execution of this part", although some duplicates must be retained, the original sentences cannot be deleted. During the process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the Chinese-English mixed parts, such as "acceptance" and "charts", but according to user requirements, these may not be modified, but can only retain the original terms.

In addition, the final end language section, such as "good above thank you", etc., also needs to be arranged correctly to ensure that the paragraph structure is reasonable. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph verbatim, check whether all the contents are properly arranged, no omissions or errors, and ensure that all the user's requirements are met, especially not to delete, not to change anything. At the same time, maintaining the natural transition between the paragraphs makes the overall reading smoother, but not to change the original intention.

First of all, let's talk about why we chose South Korea as the first stop of cross-border. It has its background. Because South Korea itself is a very high use of credit cards, and then added because we have Lipe Plus, our subsidiary in South Korea.

If we are able to successfully obtain an e-license in the future, we will want to prioritize cross-group countries, and of course we will plan to push to Japan and Thailand first. But if we do not get an e-license in the future, we will prefer to promote our cross-border business to other countries with very high credit card frequency. Well, that's just the last question. But I just received a topic related to e-payment, and then the content is completely specific, so I want to add another one.

The last question is about the EPI, and many people want to know, so I will ask again. The 12th question is: Taiwan's EPI companies have very high strength, high management, including risk management and licensing, and these will be adjusted in the cost of the license. But now in the Taiwan market, EPI companies do not see the benefits.

What strategies do we have in mind when it comes to profit creation? We want to know, so this part we want to answer in person, the chairman of the board. In the way we expect, in the way we expect, and in the way we expect, we think it is inevitable.

This is the first point of this EPI that we have to invest in and have a cost. But if we think that the cost is to spend, we have to spend this cost effectively. Fortunately, the cost that EPI needs in the industry, now we have LINE PAY in the current industry, and the cost that happens in Infra. But good thing is that we are all these things, no matter what, risk, risk control, and risk control are all very good things that LINE PAY is doing right now, so there are no extra costs that occur in this field.

The LICENSE of EPI is basically the execution of execution of execution of execution of the implementation of the implementation of the implementation of the implementation of the more extensive execution of the operation of the operation of the TSP. Take the arresting of your doctor. So based on what just said, we will make expenses effectively, and then we will use new features to create new profits, our company feels that the electronic payment business is positive and not negative for us as a whole.

Thank you for your participation. Finally, I wish you all good health. Investment is smooth. Thank you.
