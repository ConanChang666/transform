<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user's end-to-end format to the paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like most of the content is duplicated request viewers like, subscribe to, forward, and reward support programs, timestamps from 0.00 to 1559. 98, repeated every 30 seconds or so until the last few paragraphs. There is an exception to this rule: "Is there still a question you want to ask?" 26, and then continue to repeat the request support. Next, I need to collate these timestamps and corresponding sentences into paragraphs. Since the user requests do not delete anything, I have to keep all the duplicate sentences.

However, paragraphs typically mean combining sequential, similar content into paragraphs, but here the user may want each timestamp corresponding sentences individually, or grouped according to content logic. However, according to the output in the example, the user may want to combine the same content sentences together, but the timestamp remains. However, take a closer look at the example output provided by the user, and they combine the sentences of the same content into a paragraph and keep the timestamp. For example, multiple duplicates of "like..." are merged into a paragraph, separated by a comma each timestamp.

For example, the first paragraph may contain multiple timestamps, followed by the same sentence after each timestamp. At the same time, questions in the middle need to be handled separately to keep their timestamps and content. It is important to note that the format of the example provided by the user, timestamps is enclosed in square brackets, with commas separated between each timestamp, and the sentence only appears once. For example: [0.0 00-29. 98, 30. 00-59. 98, 60. 00-89. 98, ...] Please do not like the subscription forwarding to receive the support mirrors and dots.

Therefore, I need to merge all the duplicate sentences, merge the corresponding timestamps into the same line, separated by a comma, and the sentence only appears once. At the same time, the questions in the middle need to be handled separately to keep their timestamps and content. Next, I need to check if there are any timestamps or sentences that are missing, or if there is a format error. For example, timestamps 1481.96-485. 26 sentences are different and need to be listed separately.

In addition, the last timestamp 1530. 00-1559. 98 also needs to be processed. During the processing process, to ensure that all timestamps and sentences are properly merged without omissions. At the same time, the order of keeping the timestamps consistent with the original order, i.e. in chronological order. Finally, the generated paragraph-by-letters should conform to the requirements of the user, i.e. do not delete anything, keep the original sentences, just adjust the format to paragraphs, merge the sentences of the same content, and arrange the timestamp correctly. 98, 1380. 00-1409. 98, 1410. 00-1428. 34, 1440. 00-1469. 98, 1470. 00-1481. 96] Please do not hesitate to subscribe and subscribe to the Feedback Support Mirrors and Dots section.
