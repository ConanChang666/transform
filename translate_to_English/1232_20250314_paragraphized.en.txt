Unify managed's revenue increased by 6.1% year-on-year in 2024, while its gross profit also broke the record high of 98.7 billion yuan, up 13.3%.

Next, we asked Liang to explain the unified industry 2024 annual results and the watermark summary. The consolidated revenue of unified industry 2024 was NT$44859 million, a 27.30% increase over the same period.

The increase in revenue comes from the positive operation of our company's main products. The increase in revenue comes from the positive operation of our company's main products. The increase in revenue from the merger of MFA in 2024 and MFA in 2024 comes from the increase in MFA in 2024.

Gross profit and business profit growth are due to higher operating capacity utilization. Net profit is attributable to the parent company of NT$1.53 million, which grew by 125.02 per cent over the same period. Overall, we can see that our operating revenue in 2024 is high and profit is also significantly higher than the same period.

First of all, iron products grew by 43.38%, mainly due to the decline of our iron products from the same period, and the return of sales. In addition, the marketing package in addition to the group's stable order, the orders of external customers also grew. The overall operation remained stable and the revenue grew by 12.84%. Then, we reported the sales of the products, and we looked at the performance of the two products separately.

The sales of iron products increased by 50.58% over the same period in 2024, mainly thanks to the return of the customer's stock to the water level here and the increase in the demand of the market. In addition, the sales of beverage packaging also increased by 13. 12% over the same period in terms of steady growth in the beverage market.

The price of iron products in 2024 has increased significantly compared to the same period. While the average price is slightly lower than the same period, it is mainly because the price of iron and steel raw materials in the year is still low. However, thanks to the significant increase in sales just mentioned, it has also led to the increase in profit synchronously.

In addition, the pre-tax profit of beverage packaging is also growing over the same period, mainly benefiting from the increase in demand for beverages. Increased. The Group and external customer orders are driven by each other to grow, as well as further boosting the performance of profit. Next, the balance sheet is then reported, the unifying industry's 2024 financial borrowings and total debt ratio can appear to be decreasing over the same period.

The financial structure of the company is stable and healthy. Next, the cash flow statement is reported, and the cash flow statement at the end of 2024 is NT$430 million, which increases over the same period. The cash flow statement at the end of the same period is full of cash flow. Next, the policy of the company to report dividends, if the year is profitable, the company's dividend policy, if there is a profit in the year, the legal income supply, and after the listing or rotation of special surplus supply, the remaining earnings are the earnings that can be distributed by the shareholders of the year.

In 2024, the company's earnings per share was NT$0.97. After the approval of the board of directors, the cash dividend of NT$0.97 per share was issued, and the cash flow of NT$0.97 per share was raised. This part of the shareholders' meeting of this year's resolution can be issued.

Hello everyone. Next, report on the results of the unification of the 2024 year. Sorry, this page.

First of all, the consolidated revenue of 2024 is a slight decrease compared to 2023, so the main reason is to reflect the decline in international soybean raw material prices and thus lead to a decrease in domestic product prices. However, despite the decrease in revenue, but last year's domestic economic situation is quite good, then the demand can be said to be quite stable, so the price of the product decline is lower than the decline in raw material costs.

At the end of 2024, the cash level was about 2.2 billion yuan, compared with the previous year, an increase of $600 yuan. The main reason for the increase in total assets is that the total assets of 9.1 billion and the comparison of the previous year were increased, in addition to the increase in cash, mainly due to the increase in investment companies to increase the operating growth of the rental warehouse equipment accounts at the same time, and the ratio of total assets accounted for nearly one-third of the stability in these two years.

In recent years, the number of changes in capital expenditures including net cash flow generated by investment activities, including capital expenditure, have been due to the fact that our company does not have some significant investment projects, so the number of changes in the number of advance comparisons is not large in the investment activities, mainly for the issuance of cash to encourage net cash flow in 2024 is 11.66 million dollars in the amount of money compared with the earlier comparison is slightly increased mainly because the cash we issued last year encourages the previous year 6 yuan per share to 6 yuan per share, so the consolidated changes in cash increased by the end of 2024 at the end of the next.

In 2024, the earnings per share was $8.24. After the board of directors discussed the earnings per share through your allocation found $7 per share will be reported later in the year, then the shareholders' meeting of the shareholders' meeting later in the year, and then the green column in the chart above represents the earnings per share data, we can see that the earnings per share from 2015 to 2019 were maintained between $5 and $6, and since 2020, the earnings per share continued to grow steadily between $5 and more than $7 per share. In addition to the dividend policy over the past 10 years, we have always adhered to the principle of stable distribution of a cash dividend of $5 to 2019, and from 2020 to 2022, we have achieved a further increase of 6 units per share in three consecutive years. Hello Chairman and management team Hello I am Daniel from UBS Ruiying Securities here I have two questions to ask you about the first in the e-commerce business because the company has officially subscribed PC Home private equity shares at the beginning of this year do not know whether or not to ask the chairman to share with us our future strategy and layout, especially in the cooperation of the two companies, the second problem is about dividend policy I observed that is that the absolute amount of dividends that unified and unification exceeded the distribution of this year is compared to last year when we can not say that because in the next few years we are capital expenditure in the logistics park, so in recent years the dividend policy may be the same amount as the priority to think of these two questions thank you. The first part of our e-commerce business is basically what we value in the e-commerce business part is not only the so-called e-commerce, but the change situation in the digital economy in the future how we can use the e-commerce within our observation is now a more mature business model, but even the e-commerce we can see it through the digital evolution and especially the continuous progress of artificial intelligence in the whole business model can be said to change very quickly, so this year we put in the e-commerce part of the first part of our e-commerce business is a chance to learn more about the progress of the digital economy and the logic of the e-commerce business, and of the other part of the other part can also let us understand what it can play a role, so it may take a long time to look at the corresponding industries we have invested in, and its business background is only in the past many environmental factors.

The chairman and the management team are good. The former vice president asked the question all the way. The former vice president asked: There are two questions here that want to ask the chairman. The former vice president asked: We saw the part of Lok Fu has been integrated for a year. The former vice president said that in March of this year, the family welfare here also announced that the accumulation of the entire member from September to a cumulative open point. The original vice president asked: The hope is to expand the ecosystem of the entire member.

In the past, we also saw that the supermarket is actively expanding the ecosystem and liquidity of the whole point. The original vice president: that point economy is also considered as the key to the success of a brand. The former vice president: that is, how our investors should expect is the point economy here for the benefit of the group. The latter vice president: that the second question is for the unified control of the part. The former vice president: because the former chairman has mentioned that 8 to 12% of the acceptance is reasonable growth.

In the past, we also constantly emphasized that the improvement of the entire product power can bring about an improvement in the overall vitality. The original side of the investment: Of course, in the second half of 2024, we have seen the production efficiency of this product line. The original side of the investment: Is it possible to continue to look forward to the growth of the profit-making of the whole center through the promotion of the product power can be better than the growth of the revenue. The original side of the investment: Thank you.

In the past, many of us have been able to find a way to get the most out of our company. We have been able to get the most out of our company. We have been able to get the most out of our company. We have been able to get the most out of our company, and we have been able to get the most out of it. We have been able to get the most out of it. We have been able to get the most out of it.

原副投顧：那中控的部分來講的話我們還是保持一定的一個原則就是一個穩定的一個增長就是希望能夠保持一個8%到12%。 原副投顧：那目前看起來的話這個飲料的部分通常都會超過我們這個所期待但是我們內部還是有非常嚴控的一個目標。 原副投顧：我們的掌控也不希望它跑得太快還是希望控制在一個很穩定的這種。 原副投顧：那食品的部分來講的話它相對會比較挑戰。 原副投顧：因爲食品它很注重的是一個在調味的能力上面也就是說產品如果沒有辦法去做到一個很突出的一個口味上面來講的話事實上就很容易陷入到價格的競爭。 原副投顧：那對消費者來講的話其實消費者願意來購買所謂的包裝產品目的其實也是看重廠商的調味的能力他不是來買食材的他如果買食材的話他自己到市場上就可以買到食材自己去做。

This is why we want to make a challenge for consumers to do things that they can't do at home, so he has reason to buy from us. This is why we have no reason to buy from them if consumers can do it at home and we do better than we have no reason to buy from them.

I am a former vice-president of Cathay Pacific. I have three questions to ask the management. I am a former vice-president: First, I am still grateful that you have fixed to meet us. The first vice-president of Southeast Asia: The first question is about Southeast Asia, our food business has been set up in Southeast Asia for a while, just curious about the growth rate of Southeast Asia's future food business from the perspective of the whole group.

The second problem is that retail is that the environmental costs of domestic retail have risen in recent years, and the investor is also concerned about the profit margin of the unified supermarket is not a little pressure. The original deputy investment: I want to know what the group's perspective on the development of the entire Taiwan retail industry, and what the environmental costs of what to do with the model. The original deputy investment: The third is the issue of information in the recent time has been more than the AI cooperation with the unified information about the company, it is just curious to share with you what we have achieved within the AI implementation of the group and what the future income is expected of the future. The original deputy investment: In the development of Southeast Asia, this development of our development seems to be a bit inconsistent, although a lot of strength, but this is not proportional principle.

原副投顧：這個部分來講我始終覺得就是作爲一個消費品來講的話我們所謂的外派的同仁基本上是有點沒辦法很接地氣的。 原副投顧：所以我們的人員扮演的角色不是去那裏寄宿的而是去那裏做管理。 原副投顧：至於經營的部分來講的話應該還是要有外面的團隊當然外面團隊來講的話也要機運但是這沒有辦法的事情。 原副投顧：這個一定要先求量才能從求職。 原副投顧：所以現在我們東南亞的這個營運來講的話大概每個禮拜我們都規定都總經理只做一件事情不是在管業務而是在招募薪水。

This week is a regular cost, including the number of people talking about this week at the headquarters, and the number of people who hired this month, the death rate could be 99%. But as long as there is a right, the whole organization will improve. So, I am still optimistic. That is to say, if we change some of the methods, there should be some considerable breakthroughs.

This is the problem we all face. The problem that we all face is basically not the problem. So the test is our response in this environment. So this part of the talk, I think, in terms of retail, basically speaking, there is still a space in the process of innovation, it can continue to break through. That by the way you just said that, this part of the Philippines 7-11, the Philippines 7-11, and the Philippines 7-11, because now it is a bit of a change in the situation of the entire industry.

So we now expand the scope and put some small supermarkets together to calculate, so that we don't have that much to highlight. So on average, there will be 60 percent later. So in this case, the current development of our life movement in the Philippines is that, in the current development of the Philippines, its policy is that it is fast going to show the store. So since there is a lot of space after that, such as Taiwan's many innovative retail models.

This is a very difficult thing for us to do. In order to do these preparations, we can also see a very core team of our retail team, and we can also see a very core team of our retail team, which is our inventory management team. So this year will also start to officially open, and then this year will start to officially open, which is a very good layout for our future retail development.

But we have a relatively cheap place to be, is our own group, it has a lot of business. So we have to unify the information in this regard, it can start experimenting with our own internal business. Because today we assume that we are looking for someone to do this, there are a lot of sensitive things that are not convenient. But in our group, our own business is enough. So let us unify the information in a good and powerful condition to fully utilize this application.

Thank you for the simple explanation above. Ok, now let's ask the guests online. If you want to ask questions online guests, please press m1star1. Cancel the questions by m2star2.

The first question is that the CICC side, the mayor, and the management of the afternoon, thank you for the wonderful sharing, and I have two questions here. The first one is to ask, in 2024, we are in the main competitors in the mainland, the opposite side and the drink, the question is whether the pattern of the industry is improving. Because the face may be the whole pattern or the two oligarchs or say a strong one, then we see other industries may go to a certain stage, maybe the competition will slow down, for example, like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, then I don't know what kind of competition we've come to think of.

But there may be other friends who are more aggressive in the promotion process, so what I want to ask is that in the new promotion, well, in the rapid growth as a bomb and steady growth, how to achieve a good balance. What I don't know is that we can do that fast, slow down.

What does it mean to not compete, is that we are very small in this market. So, in other words, let's assume that we are not actively going to hit the family, the family is going to hit us, and the assessment is not easy.

因爲人家怎麼樣怎麼樣講，很巧合的是我們的情報也顯示在同一個時間，我們的同業內部會議也剛好說哎是因爲統一這樣這樣這樣，所以我們才這樣，所以到底誰在競爭誰，這是一個非常有趣的問題，所以我要強調的是，我們這兩年一直在避免這種所謂的競爭，因爲這個市場大到實在不需要去跟人家競爭，那我們自己有自己的節奏，自己有自己的步調，我們漲價是因爲我們準備好了，我們可以漲價，我們不漲價，也因爲我們有別的特殊的考量，所以我們不漲價，A產品漲價不代表我們B產品要漲價，所以我們的同業做什麼事情，我們也不代表我們要跟進，那我們做什麼事情，那是剛好純屬巧合，這也不是我們關心的，所以這個東西談起來有點哲學，那我不曉得你聽得懂或聽不懂，那我們現在也聽不懂了，那我們的確是在這樣的運作，所以還是回到一句話，就是說這樣的運作結果讓我們的營運變得相對穩定。 我個人比較死腦筋，我從來不相信有什麼做在現象上不會有爆品，就像煙火一樣它一定很蘊爛，但是時間都不會長久，所以我們還是比較覺得，一個產品要能夠有它的成功，它還有時間，還有相當的努力需要不斷的耕耘，那這個業務纔會長久，就像我剛剛講的，我們在那個市場來講還非常非常的渺小，所以這種情況來講的話，我們所謂的新產品，我們很多30年的老產品，對這個市場來講，實在絕大部分地方來講都還是新產品，因爲這些人從來沒見過也不需要再見了，因爲有很多產品在現場也不需要再見了，所以我們現在的這個市場，我們是在選擇，那對於新的消費者來講，我們也是不斷努力，所以這些年來，我們一直在做自己本身產品力的不斷的改善，讓消費者在選擇上面，有一個更好的一個比較基礎跟選擇，所以基本上，我們在整個市場的營運來講的話，就是我們走我們自己的路。 過去大家可能會很好奇說，這行得通嗎，我們是在互相的在拉拔競賽，怎麼可能會沒有競爭，但是事實上證明這兩年下來，我們是可以做到這一點的，因爲我們發現，市場上喜歡找人打架的廠商還蠻多的，所以你如果不去主動的要去挑釁人家，人家憑良心講，說要在人家的雷達上面找到我們，憑良心講不是那麼容易了，所以這個部分還是我們反求租集，我們把自己的事情做好，這個市場很大，潛力也很多，人口數也很多，嘴巴也很多，所以選定了路線，選定了方向，選定了市場，還是有很多的空間跟機會，可以做好自己應該要做的事情。 以上簡單的回覆，謝謝，好的，請線上主持人接入下一位提問者，下一位提問的是UBS，Veronica Song，請提問，你好，感謝管理層的分享，我是UBS的委員Veronica Song，我的問題是關於統一中共的，我想請問一下管理層，關於利潤率的方面，2025年我們怎麼去看待，就是食品飲料兩個板塊各自有哪些利潤率改善的機會和挑戰，然後有沒有一些具體的措施，可以跟大家分享，如果從中長期的角度去看的話，管理層會怎麼期待，我們未來利潤率改善的空間，以上謝謝。 這個問題非常有趣，現在市場上有一句很流行的詞，叫做廢動作，廢就是報廢的動作，這直接的解釋就是，你1月1號開始做的事情，到12月31號，你會發現你很多事情都是做白工，那爲什麼會這樣子呢，那一方面就是外面有很多的挑釁，刺激引誘，勸導引導等等等，所以你就下意識要去做這些事情，所以您剛剛所提到問題說，怎麼在我們的營運性命來講的話，實際我可以講，不只是我們公司，包含所有業界，很多部分它的費用，都是在做廢動作，就是越忙越窮這種概念，很忙，但是你會發現，不知道在忙到哪裏去，但你不忙好像又有罪惡感，覺得好像交代不過去，這是很大的一個修養的問題，這是我們要訓練的，所以對我們的營運來講的話，我們就是儘量的用機制，用政策，讓我們人員能夠做事情越簡單越好，因爲簡單就不容易出錯，不出錯，你就可以讓事情，變得更合理化，更合理化，當你的營運規模，很健康穩定的成長的時候，它的利潤自然會跑出來，所以其實大家都很關心說，我們在這個行業裏面，原物料的漲價問題，大概我所碰到，每一個人都是在關心原物料，幾乎很少人會跟我談到說，營運的費用紀律的問題，實際我們真正最大的費用，是在於營運的，因爲原物料你再怎麼漲，都是可以預期的，都是可以預防的，都是可以管理的，但是人的行爲，尤其是在市場上的角逐裏面，是事後才能夠看到的數字，那這個部分來講，就像我剛剛講的，非常非常，有很多是越忙越窮的，所以我們都儘量的能夠希望，在整個流程上能夠儘量合理化，讓我們的人可以越簡單，但其實這纔是最大的一個挑戰，因爲一般的人不喜歡簡單，一簡單會覺得日子會變得很boring，好像我們經營上談穩定。

Many industry friends have said that we have no interest, not long, there is no relationship, I think this is more real for us, stability is very important for us. So I hope I just got this, not like the answer, so that you can have some understanding. Thanks, okay, please online host to access the next questioner. The next question is Celsa LC Shane, please ask the management, I would like to ask the main control of this problem, mainly in this camp, because last year we have a very bright output last year, there is a double-digit growth, not only there is no hall tea, last year also a good contribution, then how to grasp the strength of the production camp, is there are some strategies, and then how to grasp this investment, including the resource distribution, may be between tea and no tea, how to balance the management to give us a little, thank, thank you, thank you.

今年中國大陸開始，可能從去年兩年前就開始，所謂流行所謂的無堂茶，實際上無堂茶在茶的工藝裏面是非常，非常挑戰的一個部分，因爲加了糖會分散你的注意力，你會被甜的感覺去引獲，就像做雞湯一樣，好的雞湯是看不到一點雞肉的，這個纔是非常困難，所以無堂茶實際上沒有大家想的那麼簡單，那我們還是覺得產品纔是所有營銷活動裏面的真正主角，所有的一些刺激，它都必須要經過時間的考驗，那最後還能夠真正存在的就是一個口碑，那口碑的話就是有你的產品力來講，所以同樣一排無堂茶擺在一起，你要慢慢地喝還是可以喝出來一些味道，但是這些味道里面後面可能對於研發的能力來講，它可能要花好幾年的時間才能做有點小小的突破，這種情況特別是在電商的業務上會特別明顯，因爲電商它是無接觸的一個銷售行爲，所以電商的產品要能夠持久，到最後一定就是要靠口碑，還有消費者的體驗，它不像我們到實體通路上有時候，旁邊的小姐來給你刺激一下，送你一個娃娃頭，你就不小心就買了一個你可能不想要的東西，電商不會有這個東西，電商還有退貨的機制，所以你的商品努力在長期，如果經不起考驗的話，你是沒辦法生存的，所以在這種情況下來講的話，只有不斷地在產品研發上面，不斷地努力努力繼續在努力這樣子。 所以您剛剛提到說這兩年，我們在茶的上面來講，我們的成績，我們集團在茶飲料上面來講，本身的基礎就不錯，所以在這些發展上面來講的話，我們就可以有相當好的一個條件，但是這也不能自滿，還是有很多的地方需要去努力，怎麼樣讓無糖的茶喝起來更順口，更重要的是擺了一段時間以後，還可以同樣的順口，就非常非常大的一個挑戰，那我們還在不斷的努力中，好謝謝。 請問線上主持人，線上是否還有需要提問的投資先進，是的，我們有下一位海通張怡萱請提問。 羅董事長好，管理層好，我是海通證券的飛機師張怡萱，也是很高興有這樣一個提問機會，然後還是主要想問幾個關於咱們中共這邊的問題，飲料業務的相關問題，也是非常想聽聽董事長的一個智慧和見解的一個分享，然後第一個問題就是還是在於，就是這幾年也遇到茶飲料這一塊，過去幾年其實大陸的無糖茶確實也是發展很快，像去年董事長也是提到這個千墳大雨，然後我們中共這邊去年也是奮起之追，也是取得了比較好的一個成果，包括今年整個25年其實無糖茶產品線也是有一些擴容啊，然後一方面確實我們統一中共在綠茶品類，實際上還是有一個很強的品牌運資，然後另外一方面看到整個大陸現在無糖茶還是非常的一個內卷的一個態勢，就想請教一下董事長，我們去年其實賣出了無糖茶的一大部分，那麼今年和明年我們這個無糖茶是希望怎麼走這個步伐，是希望比較平穩還是小步快跑還是希望可以比較大步流行，然後剛剛其實董事長也提到這個無堂茶是一個很拼內功的一個產品，就是能不能請董事長也介紹分享一下，就是這幾年我們在無糖茶的內功這一塊有哪些進步，對這是第一個問題要麼是要麼先請董事長介紹一下，然後我後面幾個問題再提出來。 好我先回答您剛剛那個問題就是關於茶飲料來講，現在茶飲料真的是大概是雷震雨下的是傾盆大雨一樣，所以這個東西我記得以前也跟您報告過，實際上無糖茶，這個市場來講是我們第一個推出的，我們在2006年就推出了，但問題是市場太寂寞人也變得很寂寞所以就沒做下去，一直到去年突然發現天在下大雨的時候我們身上是乾的很可惜，所以不是我們的產品有問題是我們自己的修養出了問題，那這個部分來講的話就是我剛剛講的，在中國大陸的市場裏面這麼大的一個市場裏面，恆星跟紅星，這種耐力是一個很重要的一個元素，那這兩個跟專業都沒有關係，這個是個人修爲的問題，那這種情況下來講的話，我們在茶飲料上面來講，我們在臺灣的根基本來就有相當的根基，所以現在永遠也不嫌晚，現在在努力的去追趕中，當然在無糖茶裏面就像我剛剛所報告的一樣，在公益上面來講，以前我們可以用調味或者用糖，去掩蓋一些我們技術上不足的地方，現在是真金白銀就什麼都沒有了，就像不化妝一樣素顏那很可怕，那就是真的要很好要天生立直，那這個就真的需要好好的去練功，那這個部分來講的話，我們有相當的優勢，但是我們也發現不足的地方也有很多，那所以這個部分我們還是繼續的會，會去發展，那您剛剛講這些形容詞我不太清楚，因爲每一個人的標準不得一樣，對我們來講就是穩定這兩個字，那有人把穩定變成小小碎步，有的人是積極前進，有的人是徐步向前，那我不曉得您的期望值是怎樣，那還是回到我剛剛的一個總結，就是我希望我們的組織。

It is possible to maintain a growth rate of 6 to 8 percentages every year. In the past it might be said that 12 percent. But now it feels that the 12 percent in the entire large environment may be a little too positive. Maybe this is not necessary. We adjust to 6 to 8 percent, which is very solid. So what about more than 8 percent?

If we are really healthy, we will come to the project. Under normal circumstances, we will maintain it in this robust progress, as our ministries will grow. Suppose we are very strong growth, even five percent, the absolute value created in a year is also considerable. But more importantly, is it good quality? This is more important.

So I don't know if this definition is stable, is it up to your expectations? Good thank you, Mr. Luo. Well, that scene is very clear. I still have two questions to mention. That is, apart from sugar-free tea, this plant tea drink seems to be accelerating.

This includes all kinds of 100% pure juices, and the sound of the market is also enlarged. Then we unified the CCP, and there was also this 100% NFC juice. Then we also have this bear health tea in the group system. I don't know what the chairman thinks, this botanical machine is a drink development. Then, including our CCP future, we won't introduce this product.

That's what we've been worried about in the past few years, and this sugar-free drink will break down a growth of this sugar-free drink. But it doesn't look like this from the last two years. Including our own sugar-free tea drink is also growing fast. Then, it's also a resurgence of coca-Cola, which is also seen in the second half of last year. So I'd like to hear what the president has to say about our future sugar-free drink.

We have a lot of sugar drinks in the future, and we will continue to maintain a good growth space, in what way? Thank you, Chairman. I just answered you first about sugar and sugar-free, and I think this is basically good for everyone. So now, although the market is very popular sugar-free tea, we have to look at the whole amount of sugar, in fact, this is not just a market, the world.

So this is often us, one blind spot is when we find something, we will put other things in place to kill for a while. So my personal opinion is that there are some substitutes in the middle of the circuit, but at least until now it does not seem to be conflicting, it will fight each other. So I also see a lot of industry start a little bit into the devil, and even see chocolate companies also do not want to do sugar, I don't know if you want to eat it, you don't want to eat it, you can't make it too sweet, you can't make it too sweet, you can't because it's not taste sugar.

So I think this part should be able to move forward. So you just mentioned some of the health drinks, you just have a little contradiction, you ask me, the unity will not develop this product, but you just have to say that the unity of this product, so the problem seems no longer exists. But in terms of resource allocation, I can only say that we have this product, but at this stage we will not take too much time, we will make it normal to grow.

So for our company, we still want to say that green tea has made a very good market position, black tea we are full of potential, flower tea we also have products, oolong tea we started in the layout, milk tea that should not be said more, now is a very absolute monopoly in the market. So basically, we have all kinds of tea, but in the resource allocation and the company's priority, we still have a rhythm. Thank you.

I have two questions about the CCP. First of all, I just mentioned that the market is very big, we want to stick to our own way, we want the management to help us do some better design, and we want the management to share more. If we look at this space for a long time, we should be spending some effort on what aspects, or say which areas can be more effort, and may be able to maintain as much as possible in this case to avoid some competition, to get the market share of this face and drink.

I want to understand that from the perspective of consumer consumption, it is also our potential competitor in the beverage industry. How do we think about the section of this RTD drink, now the industry stage and the certainty of the future growth. Thank you. Well, the question you just asked is about our growth space. I'm back to a personal cultivation question, is that if you only care about consumers every day, you'll find a lot of things that you haven't done well.

But in reality, we usually spend a lot of time doing this, to care about what other people are wearing today, what hairstyle, so spiritually lost. So in fact, it is decided that the people of our fate, not our peers, are consumers. Consumers are faced with an infinite choice every day, so we should take more time to think about what consumers really need, especially when they have so many choices right now. It is a very interesting disaster, we are now asking.

So we think about that, in different scenarios, what is the most suitable amount for a consumer to eat, and we want to think about this. So even if green tea, my colleagues told me that now China is very popular to drink a litre of beverages, I just started to object, because our doctor also suggested that we drink 1500cc a day, I drink two-thirds of tea, then I have to drink something else. But later we found that we also had a myth that we went outside to see the takeaway brother, he had that capacity, and then we agreed to do this.

So sometimes, it's not that the product itself is a problem, it's a product, run the wrong place, run the wrong time, it has no way to show. This part is actually the most important thing we need to do to locate a clear place. If the positioning is clear, then I said a lot of waste actions in front of me, it can not exist naturally, it will have an appropriate remuneration.

What is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two, and what is the difference between the two.

The iron part is not what we can control, because the part of our iron is basically a raw material, it follows the world's market, so many investors don't understand, run to ask us, we're not clear, to explain why the same iron last year sold 10 pieces of money, this year can sell 20 pieces of money, and next year only two pieces of money, I can't explain, this is a problem of supply and demand around the world. So now the management team is very hard to find this iron structure to adjust, so the company recently started in some additional value of this iron, to start to be able to the goods of this raw materials, more refined, so we can be more control. Of course, this takes time.

The water plant is expected to contribute to the benefits of each year? And is this water plant only for use in Korea? Recently, we have seen Xiongjin products sold in Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Party, is the group in the future will drive the engine of health drinks through Xiongjin? Our logistics center is not bad, I think we all know that we are in operation, because this is when I started to run, we started to operate, it is this October, we started to operate very smoothly, because this is our own internal doing, that the outsourced business now becomes our own internal, so on the one hand, it is very helpful in cost efficiency.

We are now looking forward to extending the land around us, as it is very expensive.

There are many uses we can do in the future. The pollution of the water source must be done to make some imitation. The best way to do this is to clean up the water plant near it. So we continue doing these things. The water plant that we see now is not a pure capacity, we value the value of it. Because the good water in the future world is very scarce.

So even in the future we are in other markets, we are planning to make use of the good water. We are beginning to be able to serve as a center of supply. Thank you. We are going back to the scene.

There is also one about logistics here. We had earlier to share with investors. Last year we shared with investors the planning of the entire group's logistics park. It also included some planning for automated warehousing.

Thank you. In the planning of the logistics, we now plan for three different levels. One is called big logistics, one is called logistics, and one is called small logistics. The word for big logistics is that we have several major logistics centers in our group together.

It is not only a matter of changing things, but also a matter of changing things. This also involves the problem of many employees working from home, especially the lack of manpower in Taiwan. So we now have several large logistics centers, which are now being built all over the country, and are being built.

But this long-term benefit is very obvious. There is also a middle logistics. The middle logistics is with our group's original logistics, which takes into account the geographical nature, about two or three units, it was originally dispersed, then they can make up a middle logistics. Because the need is not much where it is, so it is more flexible in the number of points set up and distance above it.

This part of the story will continue to be maintained and then scattered, allowing it to be in the essence of the market. So the whole logistics is laid down, we will be a round-the-clock logistics, in every corner of the main market can quickly reach a function of this warehouse riding flow. Another thing is that large logistics centers can support each other when necessary.

This part will play a big effect in the future, then our logistics system has a more distinctive one, we are all temperature layers. This now with the outside logistics can only deal with a temperature layer, not us, we are always the temperature of the frozen, we are all goods. Even our logistics is now starting to enter the so-called medical logistics. This part requires a very dense operating system, but also through the government examination.

Thank you, Mr. Luo, for sharing, it is convenient to follow up a question. You just talked about the amount of investment, it may not be a short-term or a year or two of the fund planning, which can not be in the capital expenditure and possible depreciation part of the share with us. In this part, I have also seen this schedule, I probably started this before, about five years will be the highest capital expenditure.

This is the second time we have been working on a new type of logistics, so we have a big difference. Because of our time relationship, we also have the last question on the site. There is also the person who needs to ask questions. Well, I still have a question online, there is a lot of questions about Taiwan mergers and acquisitions in the past two years, and I want to ask if there is a plan for overseas mergers and acquisitions, that is what it is. I don't think we don't have a lot of mergers, we usually go into a company, and it takes a long time before and then, so I don't think it's likely that the media's talking about the same thing, so we all feel like we're dealing with every day.

There are no other questions at this time, thank you, and the QA session of today is over. Finally, Mr. Luo asked for the conclusion of today's performance. Thank you very much for your continued concern and encouragement for the unification of the group, and we hope that every year we can have better results and better results to respond to our expectations.

Thank you again for your time here.

We spent the afternoon with us, and wish you all peace of mind, peace of mind, happiness, and thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's meeting.
