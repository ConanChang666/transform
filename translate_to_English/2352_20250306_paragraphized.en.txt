In the fourth quarter of 2024, the chairman of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., Peter Chen, Joe Huang, and Jessime Hong, the chief financial officer of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., invited the general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., Daniel Xue, general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., Daniel Xue, general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., the general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., Mr. Xue, general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Ltd., Mr. Xue, general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Mr. Xie Lin, general manager of the Gazda Technology Co., Mr., Mr. Xie Lin, general manager of the general manager of the business of the Gazuda Technology Co., Mr., Mr., Mr., Mr. Xie Yang Hong Pei Yang Hong Pei Yang, general manager of the general manager of the general manager of the general manager of the general manager of the general manager of the future brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief brief about the company, Mr Mr Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr.

In addition to the layout of the business, in recent years we have also pursued an ESG performance and the best employer award in recent years, so we see that after 2023, we have won a number of awards, such as the six-time Asia Best Employer Award, the two consecutive years Asia Corporate Social Responsibility Award and the Finance Asia Best Corporate Award.

This is the distribution of revenue of the business group, which is the purple part of our so-called high value-added business layout, which in the green part is mainly our original business. Information business IT business revenue is 1105 million, in fact, in the information business in recent years we have also set up IT high value-added, that high value-added part also accounts for 14 billion. The medical sector accounted for 13% of revenue, so we look at the medical field below we have three areas: the first called medical service that is mainly we have two civilian hospital, one in Nanjing Minquan hospital, one in Suzhou Minquan hospital; the second is the new health channel in November 2024, from the equity law became a joint subsidiary of the Nobel, that is the Taiwan's Dingan pharmacies, and the second is the medical management consulting company, the second is Comcom.

This is the first focus. The second focus is actually the combined revenue in the group, from QOQ to YOY revenue in the first quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter showing a quarterly revenue growth, this quarter growth also shows in the information business revenue, also from Q1 to Q4 growth, high value added business is also quarter-over-quarter growth.

Netcom business revenue is the only major decrease, only 17%, but QQ has begun to gradually grow, the main or client adjustment inventory, so it has decreased its revenue and profit from the same period last year. In the whole fourth quarter, although the revenue is growing, but by some cleaning inventory at the end of the year, so the total net profit is 11.700 million, although the growth of 300 million, but belongs to the parent company is less than 2.400 million, because the net profit attributable to the parent company is to be listed in the proportion of shareholding, so the last performance of EPS is only 0.1 million, YY less than 0.1 million.

The following is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph type:. What about our fourth quarter last year? In the entire business layout? We just mentioned that in November 2024, the addition of Nobel Baby shares to 40.66, so the equity law was converted to a consolidated subsidiary.

In addition, on January 20, 2025, the good news is that BenQ Hospital must first obtain the record of overseas listing of China Securities Regulatory Commission and complete the record on January 20. Now actively in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which sent the 2024 financial report, and then waited for this whole review process. Then we now look at the profit and loss table. The revenue for the fourth quarter was 541 million, YY increased 7 percent, and YY increased 7 percent.

So, in the outside world, in the fourth quarter of 2023, there was some one-off profit, then the 4th quarter of 2024 did not, so this difference is probably 100 million. So the net profit in the whole scale belongs to the parent company is 100,9, the YY is less than 200,3500, and the PS is less than 0.12. So, QOQ's point of view this revenue is an increase of 3.3 billion growth 7 percent, and then the profit above OY is less than 82 million. So the third quarter because there is cash incentive income, so it is right in the 3rd quarter of 2024. So the whole talk is less than the 3rd quarter EPS.

Gross margin 16. 5, called 16. 2 increased 0.3 percent. In the net profit of $4.5 billion less than 4 billion, the one-time profit of the night in 2023 is more positive than 1.3 billion, the one-time profit of that part of 2024 is less than 1.1 billion, so that once again it is less than 0.1 billion. So the net profit attributable to the parent company is 2 billion less than 8 billion, the EPS is less than 0.41 million. Now we see the combined balance sheet, the total assets is 2064 billion, the total debt is 68, which is similar to the same as the 30th of September 2024.

QOQ has not changed much from the number of days of receivables inventory or payables week. The following financial trends Quarterly Chain can refer to you. Then the most important left-hand revenue will see that we have accounted for 5 billion billion since the third quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter is 541 billion, then the second left-hand gross profit margin, we have continued to be more than 16%, but we have also accounted for more than 2% in the fourth quarter, but there is still a lot of room to increase.

In the first quarter of 2024, roughly half a billion of revenues, the high value added IT business revenues are estimated to be three billion. The other is our original business information, which is mainly the part of the monitor revenue from the first quarter of 219, then rises to 240 251 to 25 billion, then the gross profit of the total unemployment is more than 2.1 billion. Then we talk about the range, so look at the yellow section. So we see the QOQ and YY in the fourth quarter of medical treatment, in fact, we see the high value added between medical BSG NCG and IT, in fact, in addition to the NCG gross profit margin is 15 to 20 to 25, the three other businesses are gross profit margins.

So there is a relatively low ratio, its gross margin range is 10 to 15, the same time last year was 15 to 20 is a slight decline, which is mainly due to the decrease in the gross profit margin of the polarizer of the polarizer. Then the company's revenue distribution below this page is more detailed, so please invest in the advanced reference. Then we listed below, the company's financial performance in the new listed companies, so you can ask for advanced reference. Then we are mainly divided into business units, in addition to the garda itself, just reported there are reciprocal and small code, then the left side, the shareholding ratio and the comprehensive shareholding ratio, then your own investment advanced reference.

So Nobel, was transferred from the equity law to the consolidated subsidiary in November, then this is Nobel's own revenue, then a small decline in a six-percent. So in the intelligent solution, there are Tongqiyang Luosheng partner, are all revenue increases, and the percentage increase, such as Qiyang Luosheng has risen, so these four, there are two numbers, then the profits are also growth, and these four have set a new high profit in the last two years.

There are three main companies in the network communication. The only thing I have to say is that Mingtai is on its own. Mingtai's revenue is on the decline. Profit is also on the decline. That Zhongfu revenue is a small decrease of 4 percent. That profit is also on the decline.

The interactive revenue is growing. The amount of profit you see is also rising. But the EPS is falling. The main thing is the interaction. In fact, the overall performance of 2024 is very good.

The last number of shares is increasing. The EPS is shown below. That's my report. What do you think? Good. Investment advanced and media friends.

Hello everyone, I'm Mr. Chen Xihong, Chairman of Gatsda. That's for our 4th quarter of the year. Here's what the Finance Minister has done. That's the first point you can see. I'm particularly addicted to it.

In the 4th quarter of last year. Although our revenue is 541 million. Compared to last year's 4 quarters. As we originally expected, our revenue was on the rise.

This is the only way we can see that there is only one God, and this is the only way we can see God's glory, and this is the only way we can see God's glory, and this is the only way we can see God's glory.

This is what happened last year at the overseas subsidiary of Medart. This management above. This is too high in stock. This leads to this list of items in stock.

We decided to beat it once at the end of the year. So last year it was. In this regard, it was also a bigger impact. So, eat this profit. There is also a special note that this stock is in accordance with.

"This is the first time we've done this," he said, "and this is the first time we've done it, and we've done it this year, and we've done it this year.

And if We willed, We could have made it clear to you what We have revealed to you, and then We could have made it clear to you what We have revealed to you, and then We could have made it clear to you what has been revealed to you.

This is the first part of our product line. For example, Netcom products. For example, Netcom products. This is the fourth year of this year.

The lowest point. That's also the case in the past. Two or three years of lows. It starts from the first quarter of this year. You'll see the spring back gradually. Because of the lows in the last two years.

So the net net profit in the fourth quarter, not ideal, so eat it.

The other part of this profit, so we see it in the big merger. This profit in the fourth quarter. There is only a distribution of 0.1. The revenue is indeed a new high. This is why.

So we have to wait until the end of the month for them to return to their former glory, and then they will be able to return to their former glory, and then they will be able to return to their former glory.

This is the first point of the story. Those two people will be concerned about the situation of this year's first quarter, or this year's general estimate. That's like the last two quarters of the year.

I'm pretty sure I've done the report with you all. It's 2025, compared to 2024. We're probably more optimistic. It's going to be better than 2024.

That's it. It's now visible from the first quarter. We're seeing this December's revenue. It's about February. It's about 6% higher than last year.

February is also 11% higher than last year's February. That's March right now. It looks like it's going to be higher than last year's, so it's the first quarter of this year. It's pretty obvious.

This is the first year in a row in a row, and the first year in a row in a row in a row in a row in a row in a row in a row in a row.

The third point. A special note is that this is a cut in value. Over the past ten years, uh. We have basically all profit. But our financial statements. As a year of profit has gradually improved over a year.

So, we all saw our entire stock market. It was maintained in 197 billion years ago. That same year, we made a small portion of the stock market to buy back. So, to the fourth quarter of last year, the share capital was more than 192 points. But after all, it is still 199 billion.

That is why we still want to reduce the value by 18%. Able to make a more reasonable adjustment from the structure of the share capital. The most important thing is to increase the return on our shareholders' equity.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I need to check the transcription content provided. It looks like it's a transcription record of a meeting or report, containing multiple speakers and speeches of different time periods.

My task is to organize these dispersed sentences into paragraphs in logical order, while keeping all the original content intact. First, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and the themes of each section. For example, the first section discusses the industrial landscape, the need, and then the progress of the medical profession, and then the report of the different business clusters, and finally the Q&A section. Each section may be carried out by different speakers, and these parts need to be identified and segmented.

In addition, the user mentions that the phrase "permanently worded verbatim" may mean that each sentence has a separate timestamp and needs to be combined into a coherent paragraph, but retains the order and integrity of the original sentence. For example, if a speaker says a few sentences in a row, these sentences should be merged into a paragraph, while the content between different speakers is separated. It is also important to note that there are some possible mistakes or coherent places, such as duplicate sentences (such as "that YY growth rate is more than 5%"), which need to be kept all the content, but may be formatted to avoid confusion when typesetting.

In addition, some sentences may contain non-Chinese content or spelling errors, such as "rebirthers", "sixth-gallon deep classroom", etc., which need to be retained as they are, without modification. During the processing process, I will gradually categorize the corresponding sentences into the corresponding paragraphs to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are logically coherent, while not missing anything.

uh-display demand is generally flat, but the commercial part is expected to grow. Industrial computers and information security demand is stable and growing. The chairman of the NETVIGATOR has just said that inventory has become healthy, and gradually back to temperature. From the case of various GST businesses, the growth of IT and medical care can be the most obvious.

As for the smart solution and the NETVIGATOR business, it has moved from the low point of step-by-step to the medium-to-long growth opportunities. The NETVIGATOR project in emerging markets has been mass production, bringing new momentum in the future, and continuously improving the performance of the plant. From rebirthers to promote market forecasts, and the new sixth-gallon deep classroom volunteer Away, what's left for the future Xi Jinping has announced in the past that we have set a target of 345, 2030 carbon reduction to 20402100, which is 100% renewable energy use, and 2050 to nearly 0%.

The rest of the board of directors is also in the social or corporate system, and we are actively implementing it. Because of our emphasis and efforts, and with the large fleet, our group of 7 companies have won a total of 35 awards, including the return of us to the S&P Sustainability Yearbook and the recognition of 5% of the world. In the fierce evaluation of more than 62 7690 companies in the world, only 780 companies have been selected for the Yearbook.

In addition, we received the highest sustainable award at the Taiwan Industrial Development Department, and the National Sustainability Award last year. On this page is the result of the Grand Fleet Partner award, and you can see the name of the award, whether it is overall performance or individual projects, performance or report of the quality of the disclosure, the recognition of the external units and affirmation.

Although the commercial market customers did not reach the original sales target, our display sales in the fourth quarter, the growth rate of the quarter was nearly 10%, then the growth rate of YY reached more than 5%. The sales rate of the global display in the first quarter was more than 10%, the growth rate of the YY was also more than 5%, and the growth rate of the YY was more than 5%.

In 2024, the entire demand in the projector customer side is conservative, and then the projector's demand is more consistent. The whole is to pursue the customer needs, and according to the needs of the customer, flexible production response.

In addition, in the industrial and commercial customers here, the new products are listed, demand maintenance is good, then YOY is a small growth. The part of the car customers, he continues to add orders, the whole demand is beyond the company's expectations, then YOY is two high growth. That in 2025 is the Q1 of this year, the entire projector customer part, is still a single project. However, starting from the end of February, you can feel that the customer's Forecast has gradually increased trend. That in the industrial and commercial customers, after the Q3 Q4 of 2024, the demand continued to grow in the second quarter of the year, is also becoming conservative, the market looking for demand.

The above is the report of the business and industrial sector, thank you. Next, please report to the General Manager of the Medical Group, Mr. Yang Hong-pei. I am the General Manager of the Medical Group, Mr. Yang Hong-pei. I am here to tell you about the health sector in the fourth quarter of last year and the outlook for the first quarter of this year.

The pharmaceutical retail channel is mainly the pharmacies, and there are some of our physical channels for health. The pharmacies we have merged in last November, and the pharmacies we have had 100 hospitals since last November, and the pharmacies throughout the country now have 100 stores, which are actually expanding. The overall health is quite good. That in the pharmacies section, through the pharmacies, we start to do some national synthesis of the pharmacies, and the pharmacies, because now the pharmacies, a single pharmacies and the pharmacies, in fact, are too many, that need to face this synthesis.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. We do some in-medicine channels. This is an extension of our current entire channel.

In addition, we are in the ultrasound, in Southeast Asia, Thailand, and especially in Eastern Europe, and the current outlook is quite good. As for the future, our entire equipment in China is also desolate. Overall, in the first quarter of this year and 2025 should be the whole medical business is positive. In addition to the pharmacopoeia, all other medical materials are spread as well as the market as a whole, so the overall is positive.

Thank you. Next, Mr. Huang Wenfang, General Manager of Wangtong Business Group. I am Mr. Huang Wenfang, General Manager of Netcom Business Group. So, Netcom is the industry, and since the second half of 2023 to the end of last year, I have experienced a year and a half of inventory mediation.

The Mingtai Group has been focusing on repositioning the sub-groups and avoiding repeated investments. This includes outsourcing the production of too many factories and adding value to the medium-term. The medium-term focus is on doing this brand and adding value, and there is a company SI interaction in the Mingtai Group in addition to the medium-term.

This is why we can all work together. So, of course, this is the one that makes us more efficient in our operations. So we set up India's subsidiary in July last year. Then, India's business cut-off was also successful last year. So Q1 is expected to start mass production this month. So at the end of December last year, we also acquired an interactive partner microwave equipment company.

This is the situation in 2024. So look at the current market situation we are facing, the mid-term period since June last month and the Q3 Q4 two quarters last year has been more than the same period last year. So it seems that the temperature of the limited broadband here is very clear. So the switch and other unlimited broadband product lines, our observation is not as clear as the limited broadband at present, but there are still some stocks at the moment, but some unspecified models have started to surge.

This growth momentum should be very positive in the second half of the year. For Ming Tai Group, in addition to the temperature of this scene, we just reported our own betting on the new market of India, and this part began to shine in March. So this is our next growth momentum. So the layout of the medium and long-term growth is actually a focus of our work in 2025.

I have just made a report on the current situation of the network business group and the problems I have asked a few friends online. Thank you. Next, please report to Mr. T'ang Wenxin, General Manager of the intelligent solution business group. All investment advanced and media friends, I am T'ang Wenxin, the intelligent solution business group.

In the fourth quarter, the three main business segments of the company's business intelligence, we continue to optimize our existing business and then assist overseas subsidiaries to improve operational performance. In the first quarter of the company's OT intelligent part of the industrial computer market gradually rewind revenue, we gradually increase the market to become a network security. There are some extreme surges that continue to grow, and we actively develop weekly market development progress in the ODM project development.

Thank you. These are the results of the fourth quarter of 2024 and the Q&A outlook for the first quarter of 2025. You can now start Q&A. You can use the Q&A section below the Internet to enter your questions.

There are a few questions I can answer here.

The first is to encourage the cause of all this, we have been making money in the past ten years, then basically our principle of allotment is about 50% to 100%, that is, we are very important to this shareholder's opinion and feedback, we still try to give back to the needs of our shareholders, so the principle of allotment is that when we say that our capacity is better, then we will match the proportion of distribution can be maintained about 50% to more than 50%. So you can see that in 2020, when we are more than 4 blocks in 2020, our distribution is probably more than 2 blocks, but when we have more than 1 block in 1 to 2 blocks, our ratio will be higher, especially like last year we do not show how much attention, so we will be able to do this, and we have a lot of shareholders in line with this year.

The second part is about our income tax rate. In fact, we have calculated our own effective income tax rate is about 27%, so why we see the quarter of the number group so high, which is mainly because the Gaza Group has more than 200, each company has different tax rates in different countries, so the first factor is because the profit he is in a different country, if the quarter is in a relatively high tax rate region, so his income tax amount should be estimated relatively high, this is the first. The first question about tariffs is that the US tariffs are our specific response, that in addition to the gastronomy in China, we actually have a factory in Taiwan and Vietnam, then now Vietnam is what we want from China plus 1 we move out of this part, then the second is that in addition to China plus 1, we are now evaluating what our next step would be if Vietnam were to be taxed.

[3034. 72-3035. 72] We are in the evaluation. [3035. 72-3036. 72] We will make a decision soon. [3036. 72-3039. 72] We will probably set up China. [3039. 72-3042. 72] The fourth plant outside of Taiwan and Vietnam. [3042. 72-3044. 72] This is what we are currently evaluating. [3044. 72-3047. 72]

[3047. 72-3052. 72] That IT business group actually before February this year. [3052. 72-3053. 72] We are zero tariffs. [3053. 72-3056. 72] So the proportion of mainland China is relatively high. [3056. 72-3059. 72] After February, it is now 10% plus. [3059. 72-3062. 72] So we move to Vietnam faster. [3062. 72-3065. 72] I believe that before the second half of this year.

[3065. 72-3066. 72] That is to say. [3066. 72-3069. 72] All U.S. products should be produced in Vietnam. [3069. 72-3071. 72] This is the first. [3071. 72-3074. 72] The network business group was taxed in the first round. [3074. 72-3077. 72] So there is no added China. [3077. 72-3079. 72] Actually, his results are the same.

[3079. 72-3081. 72] Most of that has been moved to Vietnam. [3081. 72-3083. 72] If Vietnam is taxed. [3083. 72-3089. 72] He will consider setting up a plant in the third place just like IT. [3089. 72-3093. 72] The network may also be set up in India. [3093. 72-3094. 72] Find out how to outsource the plant. [3094. 72-3095. 72] This is possible.

[3095. 72-3098. 72] It is likely that other business groups have little impact. [3098. 722-3100. 72] The report above is probably a thank you. [3103. 722-3108. 72] Well, there is another problem next about industrial computers. [3108. 722-3109. 72] Edge computing of AI. [3109. 72-3112. 72] Which companies enter what fields. [3112. 72-3115. 72] What is the growth of industrial computers this year.

[3115. 72-3122. 72] Ask the general manager of this AIOT business group, Mr. Tseng Wen-Hin, to answer. [3122. 72-3124. 72] Thanks to the media for the question. [3124. 722-3126. 72] Good that this wave passes through this DeepSeek. [3126. 722-3130. 72] This AI software is more cost-effective. [3130. 722-3135. 72] has contributed to some trends in the application of these AIs around the world. [3135. 722-3137. 72] Because of this edge computing.

[3137. 722-3140. 72] So we have seen some in the Edge project. [3140. 722-3143. 72] There are actually some opportunities for the future. [3143. 722-3149. 72] Our business group doing IPC-specific companies is on the go. [3149. 72] So it is probably since the fourth quarter of last year. [3152. 722-3154. 72] We have been actively planning. [3154. 722-3155. 72] There are two aspects.

[3155. 722-3156. 72] On the one hand, we are increasing. [3156. 722-3159. 72] IY company through this software. [3159. 722-3162. 72] plus this Edge IPC solution. [3162. 722-3165. 72] Develop some more customers. [3165. 722-3168. 72] So we have strengthened in this Europe. [3168. 722-3170. 72] We have developed a development with this market in the United States.

[3170. 722-3173. 72] That is because most of our products are made in the country. [3173. 722-3178. 72] So there is no significant impact on China taxation in this United States. [3178. 722-3180. 72] So the first is that we have increased. [3180. 722-3183. 72] The development of a business between Europe and the United States. [3183. 722-3184. 72] The second. [3184. 722-3187. 72] We are also actively developing some new products.

[3187. 722-3191. 72] Especially some applications related to computing power. [3191. 72] I just reported it. [3192. 722-3194. 72] We started this first quarter of this year. [3194. 722-3197. 72] We will enhance this software. [3197. 72-3201. 72] The computing power and services have a high gross profit portfolio, such as automation. [3201. 722-3205. 72] This is our AI application for deepseek.

[3205. 723-2209. 72] The edge computing IPC market brought our response above. [3214. 723-2220. 72] Well, most of the questions we've already answered. [3220. 723-2322. 72] That's the question of firmness. [3222. 722-3225. 72] I also ask shareholders to be able to support us. [3225. 722-3227. 72] For the past ten years. [3227. 722-3233. 72] We are gradually improving our financial statements.

[3233. 72-3237. 72] That our share capital has been very large. [3237. 72-3240. 72] 197 billion is almost 20 billion. [3240. 72-3243. 72] This after all is the case for operation. [3243. 72-3247. 72] Operating above is a very heavy shell. [3247. 72-3249. 72] There are some factors in this particle. [3249. 72-3253. 72] So we decided to improve our financial statements.

[3253. 722-3258. 72] This part of the hope that shareholders can understand. [3262. 722-3265. 72] This is a long and short time. [3265. 722-3268. 72] We hope that this arrangement can make the company profit in the future. [3268. 722-3271. 72] This is possible.

[3272. 722-3273. 72] This. [3273. 722-3275. 72] is a clear improvement. [3275. 722-3276. 72] Of course we will work hard. [3276. 722-3278. 72] coupled with these reductions. [3278. 722-3284. 72] This increases the return on the shareholder's assets. [3284. 72-32286. 72] This can be returned to everyone.

[3286. 722-3288. 72] I hope you all will understand. [3288. 722-3291. 72] This is also a must-have arrangement. [3291. 722-3295. 72] The general questions of today have been answered. [3295. 722-3299. 72] This is our question here. [3299. 722-3300. 72] Thank you. [3303. 722-3304. 72] Thank you.

[3304. 723-3310. 72] [3310. 723-3311. 72] [3313. 723-3314. 72] [3314. 723-3319. 72] [3319. 723-3320. 48] Description meeting. [3320. 74-3323. 82] We will upload today's video files.

[3324. 08-3325. 86] Thank you for your participation. [3326. 12-3327. 92] You are now offline.
