You are welcome to attend KGI's online corporate meeting. The chief executive of today's speech is the chief financial officer of the spokesperson, Guo Yuwen. We first ask the chief financial officer to share with you. The first quarter of operation overview. The chief financial officer bothers you.

Thank you very much. I would like to thank KGI for the invitation. Thank you for your continued investment. We would like to invite you to join us for a legal conference. We would like to share with you the latest development of the company. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Well, first of all, the Chinese Group consists of three main business entities. The Posiflex, PoWel and Kiask, which are the main components of the Pos industrial computer motherboard and the Kiask machine. After Acer Group officially invested in Zhenhua as the biggest shareholder, the future of the Group and Acer Group will be closer and more comprehensive.

That's why we work closely with NVIDIATEC. That's why we are one of the few companies in the world that can offer Android 13 Google EDRs. That's why Android devices are the chip that adopts NVIDIATEC. That's why we will continue to develop a product that meets the growing demand for Android products in the euro market in the future.

In the future, this plant will be used for the production, maintenance and operation of a whole North American institution, and the demand for the entire warehouse space. If we add more rent, the existing manufacturing and supply chain energy in Taipei, I would like to be able to effectively, and timely support the future expansion of Europe and the United States to respond to a variety of changes.

That's because of the uncertainty of the entire tariff policy. And the rapid growth of the terminal demand. The situation of the customer to pull the goods in advance is actually more significant. So the annual revenue is estimated to come from this part of the revenue. Under the high base period of 2024, there is still a significant growth.

We started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2024. We've been in Taiwan for two quarters. After deployment in 2024 and Mexico, we'll start to hit the peak of operations.

And a transition period for generational products. The next part of the new product platform. We are still in a positive preparation. That specific timetable. The specific timetable also needs to depend on the rapid changes of the division of labor across the ecosystem. So at this time we do not have a specific timetable yet.

Not yet confirmed. So the whole AI chip module was tested on the whole. It was under the high-end of 2024.

We also see the needs of customers. There is also a clear degradation of the performance part. But this is the same as asking the US tariff issue.

There is not a clear case. There is still time for the whole customer to restore inventory. There is still a time to be seen. There is a part of smart medicine. Its performance is relatively stable. It continues to profit by contributing to revenue.

This part is relatively stable. So comprehensive. The Group's revenue for Embedded Funding in 2025. At the high end of 2024. There is still a good growth expected. It is only under the influence of the overall economic situation.

This is the part of Embedded Funding. As for the part of O2O. In addition to the SCO and SOK that has just been mentioned. System checkout system order system. Because both systems are combined with new AI extensions.

There is damage to the object to recognize these value services. After the exhibition, the customer feedback is also good. It can further enhance one of our differences. There is also a certain advantage. It is believed that we can start to contribute to our revenue and profit.

We have also recently launched many new POS products. Those new products. There are also many large retailers. Especially one note here in Europe. There is also a lot of attention. Many projects are in progress.

That is the part of Kiask. Public transport. Because of the relationship made in the United States. So the U.S. government budget. There is a U.S. government budget. That is especially the part of the public transport infrastructure project.

San Francisco's gate system is approaching completion. So it is expected that the next season will begin. A project from the Los Angeles area will begin. The project is mainly after the start of the project. The main thing is to prepare for the 2028 Olympics.

Our main market is a chain store before CUHK, which in fact it is a need for dye printing integration and maintenance services. The general cloud POS, it is on the cloud POS, it is a small retail restaurant use, it is at the core of the payment, so it is a difference between our market. As for the company, the group's introduction of AI technology in Kiask, mainly just mentioned is the prevention and object recognition related AI services.

This is followed by a summary of the tariffs and exchange rate related issues. In response to the impact of tariffs, there are two major manufacturing plants in the United States, and that is not going to happen. We have just reported with you, and the new plant prevention we invest in is expected to be enabled in the fourth quarter of 2026. After the completion of the investment, the overall function of the plant will be more complete, and it should be able to respond to a large extent and reduce the potential impact of tariffs. That said, if the Chinese customers look at the U.S., the proportion of revenue is high, but most of our actual shipping in Asia, it is directly shipped to the U.S., which is relatively low. Kiask, because we are mainly manufactured in the U.S., so the impact of tariffs is relatively controllable.

But in the long run, IPC operators in Taiwan are substantiated in their respective areas, which will continue to protect against a change in the overall economy and a change in the exchange rate. Then again, it is a related question about revenue profitability. The main reason for the increase in gross profit in the first quarter is that a system brand medical and three-year definition of smart device revenues continue to increase, which contributes to more than 80% of the revenue of a group.

However, in the second half of 2025, due to the economic factors such as tariffs, as well as the impact of this first-hand product update reception, the overall situation is still unclear, and further observation is needed. But overall, the Group's performance in the year 2025, both in revenue and profit, will still have a good growth under the advanced period of 2024. There are some other issues besides the above, I also explained with you. The Ministry of Investment and Finance asked us about the progress of a merger and acquisition project that we will be talking about in March, our merger and acquisition is basically a strategy based on SDA, and we are actively taking into account many different targets in various domestic and foreign applications, this activity is ongoing.

So now if for the sake of a stream, you can go back and see some of them too all near here in Hong Kong. Thank you, Chief Financial Officer. Today we mainly only open this part of the text question, so if you have any questions, please ask the presenter if you want to ask.

As for the gross profit margin, one level of our long-term gross profit margin is about 40% or 40%, and in the short term, it should be maintained relatively high, that is, the above explanation. That is, if you do not have any further questions, please ask your question to our website, or find the speaker's chat window. That is, we have a large number of customers in the semiconductor field, and this business has started a long-term relationship since 2018, and this is a one-stop answer for AI-related customers.

It has always been such a change, it is in the late period it is once again deepened in the program to try some of the ren services.
