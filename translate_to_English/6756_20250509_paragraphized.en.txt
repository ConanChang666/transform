<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim fragments provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

It is important to note that some sentences may repeat or have timestamp jumps, such as skipping to [285. 24-286. 24] after [277. 48-280. 28], there may be omissions or errors in the middle, but according to user requirements, nothing can be deleted, so all sentences must be retained and arranged correctly. In addition, to ensure that every paragraph of the sentence is consistent with the natural oral expression habits. For example, the financial part of the data and analysis should be presented consistently, and the technical details of the product introduction part should be kept in logical order.

In addition, pay attention to the uniformity of punctuation and format, such as using the correct quotation marks and segmentation. Finally, check that the entire paragraph verbatim is consistent with all the requirements of the user, make sure that no sentences are missing, all the timestamps and contents are accurate, and that paragraphs are split easily and easy to read.

First of all, I would like to thank all investors for attending the Investor Conference for the first quarter of 2025. I would like to take this step forward, probably by Jason, our financial manager, to report the results of the actual operation of Q1 in the whole year 2025.

Thank you. We hope you all enjoyed the first half of 2025. We'll share with you how we're doing in the first quarter of 2025.

First of all, we can see the first quarter of the month's revenue is sitting between $200 and $400 million, accumulating about NT$39 billion in Q1. April's revenue had already been announced before, NT$5.2 billion, which is a 20% revenue rate of 20% compared to March, with a 20% growth rate. The overall revenue trend in 2025 is almost the same as that of 2024. The following is the part of the financial report.

As for the total operating expenses of OPES, this quarter is about 200 million yuan, and this quarter does not have much impact on the difference. Overall, the first quarter of the local municipality praised about NT$2.20 million, which can be seen that losses are obvious compared to the previous quarter. The outside part is about NT$2 million, which is mainly due to the evaluation of financial products, and there is a low interest rate deposit.

The average revenue in the past five quarters has fallen to about 3.6 billion to 500 million, which is mainly affected by seasonal and terminal demand. We expect a general demand for 2025 to slowly go back to a pace of seasonal growth, but between the current Q2 period, the size of the stock market and the impact of the second half of the year to receive tariff uncertainty, and the entire revenue variable in the second half is relatively unpredictable. As for the summary of the past five quarters with EPS, it can be seen that while Q1's revenue and gross profit are not too much a recession, but in the EPS and net profit performance has seen a decline in the past quarters. The main reason for this part is that Q1's contribution to the industry is not too obvious in the previous quarter, so the whole figure is showing a decline.

First of all, let's look at the current situation of the USB4 platform support, where we see there are more new platforms on this side of the AMD Apple. That actually continued before the situation is that the new platform basically supports USB4. One of the more significant progress for us is our VIO832, which is the USB4 device IC of the USB4 device certified by USB4. There will be a new platform that we push the USB4 VIO832 for a long time, and that is a new platform that we push the USB4 VIO832 for a long time.

The first is that the USB hub application series is very widely used in industrial PCs, and there is a part of it that is used in industrial PCs on the products above. That was before the Weiwei wind, then the products were mostly commercial, but we saw such a trend and customer needs, so in the second half of the year we will also launch a product that conforms to the public or wide temperature.

This basically supports four downlinks, it supports two type A and two type C, because the more and more devices in the USB type C, so the dumping station may have only one downlink, but the slow customer needs to put a C. So this VL832 will integrate the downlinks support two type Cs, it needs two type Cs it needs to have that USBCC logic and some DataMask, and here we are all integrating it together. In addition to our current VL822, its power consumption is about 20% lower, which is in addition to the low power consumption of the whole Bone cost will be more competitive for customers.

A new product is a 4 to 6 BPO mode mask. In fact, we currently have a breeze already BPE1. It is also a 4 to 6 mask. But it does not support a specification in Pin-a-3 door Echo. The Pin-a-3 door Echo refers to.

The direction of your cable connection is DP to USB type C. Traditionally we are USB type C. Received DP. But this Pin-a-3 door is more special. The DP head is attached to the notebook. Then the type C is received on the screen.

It is a very special connection. Such connection is basically in that monitor. It is the application of the screen here. It is already a required item. So we launched the VL172 to support this application. It is also the second half of the year.

The sample is now tested internally. It is expected that Q3 Q4 will be mass production. And lastly, we have a new DP hub. It is actually similar to the USB hub.

The TL610 is a DP hub. The TL610 is a DP. The DP is a DP. The DP is an DP. The DP is extended to the screen. You can either connect an HDMI or a DP connector.

Or the DP connector. Or the HDMI connector or the DP connector. Or the HDMI connector or the DP connector. Export it. We support the output of three screens. That's just the TL610.

We expect it to be this year. We have already pushed it out this week. It is expected. Q4 We can send it. That's basically our line up. It's the speed that supports HBR3 8. 1G.

We support three video outputs. You can connect it to two HDMI 2.1, one DP++, or two DP++.

We only need one feed. Then we can change it on the line. Two output specifications can be supported. That's the one. It can support up to one 8K60 screen, or two 4K144 screens.

Or three 4K60 screens. The package is QFN100. Currently, the mainstream on the market may still be based on VGA. Its cost is relatively high. We already have a QFN100.

Make the whole Bonecost more competitive. That's the current market. That's the video converter with multiple outputs. The main player is the new teacher of ZioTech and American businesses. That's what we've done. That's the Dice size analysis.

PowerConsumption analysis. We VL610 in both respects. Relatively speaking, it should be. Very competitive. Whether it is Dice size or PowerConsumption. Here are some new products that we expect to come up with in the second half of the year.

That's another part of the market. Last year we saw the high-end mobile phone. We have already supported some of the 3A games. In addition to this, we also saw that there is also a game in the market. That's the whole trend.

It should be from that Nintendo. Switch. It can basically be in the form of a handheld device. Or by taking that Docking station to throw it over the TV. It becomes a game console. Continue this trend.

The first was the Steam Deck of the Fab. Then we saw the traditional Notebook manufacturers. No matter whether it was Asus. Manfo MSI also had the game corresponding to it. The Acer is.

Finally join this section. This is the market. This game is the console. It is basically what he provides to the user. You can play the form of the handheld. Or you can use a docking station.

You can turn it into a gaming console. It's a screen that throws it to the esports screen, or the TV on it. That's why we're seeing this kind of application. There's a need for that Docking station. That's what you need.

Our breeze. We launched a GamingDock gamepad. This is a reference design. It's on this design. Use our USB4. VL832 It's our other PD3. 1.

3. 2 PD controller. VL109 It is a three-piece PD controller. One connector to the line. Then a connector to the charging port. Then a connector to Type-C. That image or data port.

It is a DP to HDMI converter. It is in this design. Basically it has three highlights. The first one is that it is very compatible with 2027.

EU regulation for energy saving. That's what it's called. It's called EUPERP. It's the regulation of 2025 when you're on standby. The entire device can't exceed 0.5 watts. That's 2027.

Its specification is more stringent. The whole device is standby. Standby. When the time is not more than 0.3 watts. We are the one. BAMbee DAG's reference design.

We basically cut the power of the VL832 and the VL605. We cut it off. We only keep the PD controller. The VL109 power. We can do it in standby mode.

Only 10mW. That's just coded 0.3W is 300mW. We left a lot of space. It allows customers to go cheap. That's the Power adapter. Or your entire design above.

You don't need to use very much. It's a very energy efficient material. Because we put the energy saving place. We're the ICs. It's very energy efficient. That's the customer's Bomb.

This is the first highlight of the game. Since you can play the game at the same time, you may not be able to connect the two screens at the same time.

Through a simple design, it is possible to use a MAS. It can support the HDMI connector. Or through Type-C to connect some of the current. Mobile screen. Because now Type-C screen.

Whether it's moving. Or the desktop is getting more and more popular. We're basically this design. It provides the user with two monitors.

The following are the rearranged paragraph-by-text texts:. Selection of the interface. ---- [888. 68-890. 28] Selection of the interface. But not through the MSD hub. -------------------- [890. 28-892. 76] But not through the MSD hub. The whole phone cost is OK.

---------- [892. 76-895.1. 08] So the whole phone cost is OK. When playing the game. ---------- [896. 92-899. 16] The third is when playing the game. There is an important feature called VRR. ---------- [899. 16-901. 28] There is a very important feature called VRR. It is changeable rate.

Thank you all. ---------- [1197. 92-1256. 92] Thank you all. I would like to invite you all to come up with your questions. ---------- [1226. 92-1254. 08] I would like to invite you to come up with your questions.

I have a few questions that I would like to ask about investors. ------------------ [1256. 92-1260. 24] I have a few questions that I would like to ask about investors. There is a little interest here. ---------- [1260. 24-1262. 12] There is a little interest here. The first, of course, is about Trump's tariffs. ------------------ [1262. 126-1266. 68] The first, of course, is about Trump's tariffs.

That's what I want to say about tariffs. ---------- [1266. 68-1269. 24] That's what I want to say about tariffs. Frankly speaking about Trump's behavior. ---------- [1269. 24-1271. 72] Frankly speaking about Trump's behavior.

In addition, of course, it is now another 90 days later. ------------------ [1281. 92-1286.92] Also, of course, it is now another 90 days later. In the past, we had the effect of these tariffs. ------------------ [1286. 92-1291.96] In the past, we had the effect of these tariffs.

Because our customers are not directly in our ICs. ---------- [1295. 88-1300. 48] Because our customers are not directly in our ICs. Go to Native America.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, converting them from a verbatim format to a paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original text must be maintained.

First of all, I read through the entire transcription fragment to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses tariffs, the impact of exchange rates on business, and the situation of new products such as switch2. Next, I need to identify the corresponding sentences for each timestamp and group them according to logic to form a coherent paragraph.

For example, the part of the tariff impact should be arranged consistently, while the part of the exchange rate impact is another paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to whether the connection between the sentence is natural, whether it is necessary to add a punctuation or adjust the format to enhance readability, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so you can only adjust the format.

For example, some timestamps may cross multiple sentences and need to check if they belong to the same paragraph. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences or timestamp errors to ensure that all contents are converted correctly. Finally, after the conversion, I will read the entire paragraph-based verbatim text again to make sure that there are no missing sentences, all the contents are arranged in the original order, and in the correct format. At the same time, check for any format errors such as incorrect punctuation using incorrect or paragraph separators to ensure that the final result is consistent with the user's requirements.

[1386. 28-1389. 20] In fact, there is no special effect. [1389. 20-1391. 80] I think this is mainly tariff here. [1391. 80-1393. 64] I think our guests. [1393. 64-1396. 88] Most of our guests are OEMs. [1393. 64-1396. 88-1402. 52] This is probably the arrangement of these things they do. [1402. 52-1406. 36] Of course, the tariffs will also be an impact.

[1406. 36-1408. 24] We don't really know. [1408. 24-1410. 72] Today is May 9th. [1410. 72-1413. 20] I think Trump's tariffs on the semiconductor side. [1413. 20-1415. 32] Or one of the other tariffs. [1415. 32-1418. 88] A Spread idea is not something that will happen again. [1418. 88-1419. 52] I don't know.

[1419. 52-1422. 96] But I think that most of our guests are arranged like this. [1422. 96-1426. 12] Of course, there are investors who say so. [1426. 12-1431. 08] This is an entire effect on the first half of Q2 here. [1431. 08-1433. 68] This is not a special effect on the second half of the year. [1433. 68-1436. 36] To be honest, [1436. 36-1438. 92] This is true in Q2.

[1438. 92-1445. 32] Because tariffs are from April 2 until now this is expected to extend 90 days. [1445. 32-1449. 04] So some guests are probably going to give it if they say it's true. [1449. 04-1452. 00] To sell the U.S. part of the product. [1452. 00-1445. 48] I think they will have part of this pull in. [1454. 48-1445. 24] Indeed. [1455. 24-1459. 40] So we can also see that the revenue in April is actually comparable.

[1459. 40-1465. 72] Our traditional April, or more than March, increased by about 27%. [1465. 72-1466. 32] So this part. [1466. 36-1467. 64] seems to have some effect. [1467. 64-1472. 00] That would not make this second half of this year or Q3. [1472. 00-1473. 28] Q4's revenue. [1473. 28-1475. 68] pull in this Q2.

[1475. 68-1477. 36] Then it turned into the second half of the year. [1477. 36-1478. 92] This statement is not true. [1478. 92-1480. 44] It is also uncertain. [1480. 44-1483. 32] It is, of course, the whole market. [1483 32-1488. 32] This year it was originally PC or notebook for this year. [1488. 32-1492. 04] Last year it was estimated this year's growth rate.

[1492. 04-1495. 04] There will probably be at least one growth of a single digit. [1495. 04-1496. 32] But now. [1496. 36-1498. 16] After the entire tariff impact comes in. [1498. 16-1502. 84] This will lead to the fact that this type of uncertainty is going to grow again this year. [1502. 84-1507. 88] The expected growth rate of the original growth rate is from the fact that the OS is actually coming in. [1507 88-1512. 80] WindowsOS 11 will come in.

[1512. 80-1514. 80] So basically, there should be some change in the tide. [1514. 80-1518. 88] Indeed, there is a state in Q1. [1518. 88-1520. 80] Of course, the whole thing is messy now. [1520. 80-1524. 88] To be frank, we are not very clear. [1524. 88-1526. 32] But now it is. [1526. 36-1528. 16] Q2 looks a little better.

[1528. 16-1530. 80] The Q3 Q4 will not be affected by this. [1530. 80-1532. 76] This we may also have to look into. [1532. 76-1537. 36] Of course, colleagues were asking about the exchange rate. [1537. 36-1542. 24] I think the exchange rate is also a very big factor. [1542.2 24-1545. 88] I would like to be at the end of April to early May. [1545. 88-1548. 40] I think these trading days.

[1548. 40-1550. 24] Almost two or three trading days. [1550. 24-1552. 92] In fact, the entire Taiwan dollar was up 10%. [1552. 92-1553. 36] I think no one could possibly escape this appreciation problem. [1553. 36-1553. 76] I think no one could possibly escape this appreciation problem. [1553. 76-1554. 36] I think no one could possibly escape this appreciation problem. [1554. 36-1554. 76] I think no one could possibly escape this appreciation problem. [1554. 36-1554. 76]

[1554. 76-1555. 36] I think no one can escape this appreciation problem. [1555. 36-1556. 64] I think no one can escape this appreciation problem. [1556. 64-1556. 96] I think no one can escape this appreciation problem. [1556. 96-1557. 00] I think no one can escape this appreciation problem. [1557. 00-1557. 04] I think no one can escape this appreciation problem. [1557. 041-1558. 36]

[1586. 36-1561. 00] It may be difficult to escape the effect of this appreciation. [1561] 00-1564. 52] That is to say. [1564. 52-1566. 48] We wind up here. [1566. 48-1568. 20] In fact, Q1. [1568. 20-1570. 44] When he came from Trump. [1570. 44-1574. 76] He had already declared that he wanted to degrade the dollar.

[1574. 76-1577. 68] So we are actually in Q1. [1577. 68-1579. 84] or referring to Q2 here. [1579. 84-1583. 12] In fact, we also try to reduce the dollar parts. [1583. 12-1584. 28] So basically. [1584. 28-1588. 32] This.

[1588. 24-1591. 68] But it should still be within control. [1591. 68-1592. 92] For that matter. [1592. 92-1596. 48] The value of the Taiwan Dollar rises by 1% to 10%. [1596. 48-1599. 60] How does it affect the total gross profit margin or net profit margin? [1599. 60-1602. 24] In fact, gross profit will have an impact. [1602 24-1603. 92] The effect of the gross profit margin.

[1603. 92-1606. 00] Of course it will affect the net profit here. [1606. 00-1609. 00] I would like to talk to you guys first. [1609. 00-1612. 32] This is actually our cost end. [1612. 32-1615. 20] In fact, most of it comes from [1615. 32-1617. 52] U.S. dollar parts. [1617. 52-1621. 80] Because our sales are in fact U.S. dollars. base price.

[1621. 80-1622. 32] There is no error. [1622. 32-1625. 12] But our cost ends. [1625. 12-1627. 20] is basically a U.S. dollar part. [1627. 20-1629. 00] The proportion is also quite large. [1629. 00-1632. 60] So basically the two buckles are behind each other. [1632. 60-1636. 28] May be a dollar appreciation.

[1636. 28-1637. 72] The number of possible effects. [1637. 72-1641. 08] may be substantially reduced. [1641. 08-1643. 44] So this is called natural hedge. [1643. 44-1644. 92] natural hedge basically. [1645. 32-1647. 00] So basically what we want to see is to say.

[1650. 28-1651. 88] My net USD portion. [1651. 88-1653. 64] includes AR minus AP. [1653. 64-1655. 36] plus cash portion of my hand. [1655. 36-1656. 92] This affects my water transport. [1656. 92-1659. 08] Also, of course, the revenue portion. [1659. 08-1659. 96] Will be affected.

[1659. 96-1662. 24] But I can't imagine that it rose by 10%. [1662. 24-1665. 36] We probably lost our gross profit by 10%. [1665. 36-1666. 32] That's not going to happen. [1666. 32-1669. 08] That's probably the case. [1669. 08-1675. 16] And of course, there are investors as well. [1675. 32-1677. 72]

[1682. 04-1682. 64] We have to try again. [1682. 64-1684. 72] Because switch2 switch2 switch1. [1684. 72-1688. 96] Basically we are the supplier of the main supply. [1688. 96-1692. 36] switch2 may become a secondary supplier. [1692. 36-1695. 88] So this part of our share.

[1695. 88-1699. 52] Now it is still relatively small. [1699. 52-1702. 52] So basically we wait until the whole switch2. [1702. 52-1703. 32] It starts. [1705. 32-1706. 52] After this market goes in. [1706. 52-1708. 60] Our products may come in. [1708. 60-1713. 28] So this part may take a little longer.

[1713. 28-1717. 32] There is another mention of this year. [1717. 32-1720. 44] I would like to see this year's revenue. [1720. 44-1724. 60] May currently look like the whole Q1 vs last year's Q1. [1724. 60-1727. 12] is basically the same. [1727. 12-1728. 88] May have a slight decline. [1728. 88-1731. 88] That Q2 may be better than last year's Q2.

[1731. 88-1734. 24] So we see just us this year. [1735. 32-1740. 32] The Director of Product Marketing has already made some reports with you here. [1740. 32-1745. 84] In fact, we have the time to launch some new products. [1745. 84-1747. 56] Our ongoing efforts. [1747.

This is about USB4 ducking, so this part of the Q3 of this year will probably start to enter quantum, so we think that there should be some reason for growth, I think this part is a good phenomenon. I just want to mention that in fact, all platforms, whether AMD Intel or SoC Apple etc., almost all of the so-called support USB4, so the adoption rate of USB4 is undoubtedly, but now I just want to say who will use these devices, and who will use these devices. I just want to have a use case, in addition to the USB4 ducking, in fact, is just about gaming ducking here, is a future opportunity, and also a future amount, so we are also looking forward to this part, and we hope that in this place, there is a more obvious penetration rate, and a space with a growth.

In the past, we spent a lot of time in the effort, and I think there will be some chances, but to do some cooperation. Well, of course, I said, I think there are some problems, I'll probably answer them together. I just want to say that in the second half of the year, Q2 here we see, about all of them. I think the combination of products is that we basically or in the USB hub, here is a type c hub, here the product range is the Lord, then, after that is USB 4 up, I want to weigh the product, there may be some difference.

In fact, Mr. Trump's tariff ratio will be adjusted to China's products. I think the tariffs of 145 are basically different from each other, so it's unlikely to be 145, so basically I want to go down. Of course, I just said to my colleagues that we are not going to sell our products directly to the U.S., so this section has no impact on our customers, but if he is in the U.S., it will certainly have an impact on us. Of course, it's the fact that each of my customers, he's in the U.S., in fact, we're not the same size as each company, and that's probably the least.

If there are no other problems with the online legal friends, then we will finish the spell today, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
