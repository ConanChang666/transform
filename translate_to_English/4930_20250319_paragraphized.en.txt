<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user, and convert it from the verbatim format to the paragraph. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the verbatim text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any of the original text, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

In the course of the conversion, special attention should be paid to repetitive or similar sentences, such as the parts of the business expenses, may need to be merged or adjusted, but all the original sentences must be kept. At the same time, pay attention to the coherentness of the timestamp, ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, without missing any information. Finally, read the paragraph-based transcription of the entire transition, check whether all the original sentences are properly preserved, without omissions or errors, and the logic between paragraphs is clear and easy to read.

We welcome you to attend the conference of the Industrial Innovation Netcom Co., Ltd. The presentation of the company's industry situation, operating results and future prospects is now presented by the company's management team. Now we will introduce you to the management team of the company and the accounting manager of the evening victory manager. Next, we will pass the time to the manager of the night win, please ask the manager of night win.

First of all I would like to thank Yuanta Securities, and thank you for your continued investment. That is why I would like to give you a brief explanation on the situation of the entire network in 2024, as well as some 25 years of general development. We would like to first look at the entire operating investment structure.

One of the main customers is European countries and American countries, of course, Asia contains Japan South Korea and Russia here, we have continued to expand our sales channels. That includes saying that the Middle East market here we are also active in the strategy. In the catering business section, Cotai Coffee remains a bakery within the group which is more important so-called coffee beans raw materials.

In fact, in the past year, the environment in Japan has been relatively less favorable, and our investment operations here in Japan are relatively conservative. This year seems to be some changes, and we will continue to observe. Next, let's take a look at the overall focus of a business pack in 2024.

First of all, in the revenue section, we are called to have a 15% growth in the same period, the main growth part is in the United States and Asian countries. The larger part should be in the Americas. In the operating cost section, as well as the absolute growth in the income section, we can see that the decline in the same period is mainly due to a relatively large increase in the current 2024 whole raw materials, especially the large Chinese metal part. This part really affects our profitability in the market.

In addition, the small home appliance market is currently in China, which is a relatively competitive industry. Therefore, in order to maintain a certain market share, some business strategies have been adjusted. This adjustment is still in a transition period, so there are some slight differences in business gross profit. In the case of business expenses, of course, it changes with a growth in our business income.

This part is reflected in some of our business benefits. However, we still do some of the work outside the industry. It seems that the amount is actually said to be better than 112 years of business profits. This is mainly because the area of Zhangzhou we are working with the local government to make a reorganization. This rectification will be carried out in 2023 and we will make a lease adjustment in the year 112.

In addition to this, of course, we are in some financial dealings with exchange rates, there are still considerable gains. This part is also reflected in our revenue outside our business. We have a relatively large portion of an advanced commodity in the past to operate a profit better long-term storage. Overall, an EPS of 113 years is probably 2.67. The industry is essentially maintaining a certain level.

This part of our financial planning seems to have a certain effect, of course, our revenues and the maintenance of our industry's profitability also have some benefit. This part of our revenue growth relative to our revenues will grow and then there will be no major expected price in the revenue accounts at the moment, so there is still a normal weekly shift. As for other assets, there will be a decrease in the amount of liquidity, mainly the last length of our electricians. We see the increase in liquidity liabilities here, on the one hand, because we have a longer period of supply, so we have a growth in the amount of money that we pays for, on the other hand, because we have made some short-term borrowings for financial order operations.

As for non-current liabilities, the main part is our electric locking debt and a change in the middle. Overall, the 113-year balance is a little 162 years or a stretch of our entire revenue. In the 25-year part is still a promotion to the marketing channel expansion and distribution business. This part is just beginning to mention that the main or the Russian market and the Middle East markets are part of the company's internal rather than the last 24 years we have been constantly on the strategy.

We have also developed a series of strategic preparations to see if we can make some better use of this year's Chinese market. Because after all, China's interior needs from the first quarter of the year seems to be a bit of a payoff, so we also look forward to saying that our strategy can come together. The part of the technology R&D and product self-worth, which is mainly due to the fact that some small appliances in the market, in addition to functional networking, can not be operated remotely or even some designs, and some current trends such as environmental protection and carbon reduction, etc., is also adjusted through technical research and development, of course, the introduction of some materials that say that are more environmentally friendly and environmental friendly, or even if it is possible to achieve some of the purpose of reducing carbon emissions.

In addition to the changes in the area, of course, we will also make an update and switch on the capital expenditure equipment, which will provide unit efficiency. So this part of the process is still in progress to expect the entire period of the entire site may take two to three years. So this area modification does not affect some of our original production plans and statement plans, so investment advanced is not required to speculate on this part because this is important for our shipping revenue, so we see some end-to-ends.
