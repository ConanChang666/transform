<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user to the paragraph. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that I fully understand the task. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all the original sentences must be retained. This means that I need to be organized strictly in accordance with the order and content of the original text, just adjust the format. Next, I will read the entire verbatim text to understand the overall structure and content.

The content is divided into two parts: financial reporting and operational overview, each with detailed data and comparison. Now, I need to consolidate these verbatim entries into a coherent paragraph. First, determine the subject of each paragraph. For example, the beginning is greeting and introduction, followed by the various parts of the financial report, then the quarterly data comparison, and lastly the operational overview and customer distribution.

For example, when it comes to data comparisons for different years, use "b..." or "compare..." to connect. At the same time, pay attention to the time order, such as the whole year 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 separate data processing. In addition, the user mentions the duplicate content need to pay special attention. For example, the sentences about gross margin in the first quarter of 2025 are repeated more than the first quarter of 2024, and must be kept all the time, which may need to be handled appropriately in paragraphs to avoid being redundant, but not in violation of the user's requirements.

Finally, after the conversion, read the entire paragraph verbatim to ensure smoothness and accuracy, while confirming that nothing has been modified and executed in accordance with the requirements of the user. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to re-arrange the original data to ensure that the converted text is consistent with the original. </think> Below is the compiled paragraph verbatim verb (fully retain all the original sentences, only adjust the formatting and punctuation): Hello everyone, today is a great opportunity to report on the operation of the first quarter of 2025 and the full year of 2024. The report is divided into two aspects, the first is financial statements and the second is an overview of the operation.

In terms of financial reporting, Goldstar Optics achieved an average gross profit margin of 56.1% in 2024, an improvement of 4.2% compared to 2023. In terms of operating profit, the earnings per share of $23.47 were also improved compared to $22.83 in 2023. If we look at the figures in the quarter, the first quarter of 2025 was down 11.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which is a normal quarterly uptrend. In terms of gross profit margin, the first quarter was 55.1%, and the first quarter was 11.2% lower than the first quarter of 2024.

The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower. The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower. The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower. The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower. The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower.

The first quarter of 2024 was 11.2% lower. The fourth quarter of 2024 was 54.6% better than the fourth quarter of 2024. In terms of net operating interest rates, 27.1% was equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2024. In the end, EPS in the first quarter of 2025 was 6.27, compared to 5.24 in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the first quarter, $6.54 fell, but the decline was not high. This was a quarterly operating condition for a report. The following is the operating overview report. The trend of revenue and profitability is as previously reported. Growth rate of revenue. Growth rate of revenue.

The growth rate of revenue is also expected in 2025. That profit, in 2025, seems to be better now than 2024. In terms of regional share of revenue, the rest of the region in the first quarter of 2025 refers to the region similar to Europe, accounting for 5.62 percent.

In fact, the revenue share of these three regions does not change much compared to 2024, which is a stable situation. If revenue is divided by brand and OEM share, the brand in the first quarter of 2025 accounted for 19.3 percent, and the foundry accounted for 80.7 percent. This figure is probably stable compared to the second quarter of 2024 even compared to 2023. The revenue accounted for more than 10 large customers, the largest customer in the first quarter of 2025 accounted for 25.4 percent, which is similar to the previous contract rate. The second-largest customers have reached 13.8 percent, the other customers accounted for 20.4 percent.

The rest of the customers account for 60.8 percent. This is an action that reflects a sophisticated optics has been doing to diversify the proportion of customers, and so on, and this action continues. Monthly revenues can be seen more clearly with a quarterly change. However, with the change in quarters and year-on-year changes, it is likely to be expected.

This is a list of things to do and to be thankful for.
