[77. 56-82. 68] So we should have been established today for 57 years. [82. 68-87. 56] is a really long-standing channel. [87. 56-89. 12] I first explained to us. [89. 12-95. 60] If this is the first time we hear about our company or first contact with our company. [95. 60-96. 44] So-called advanced. [96. 44-98. 52] I first report to you.

[98. 52-101. 64] Ornate is a so-called channel. [101. 64-108. 60] Basically we do not manufacture or process any ingredients in it. [108. 60-118. 70] We are simply importing this advanced high-tech upstream raw materials from Japan or other countries. [118. 70-119. 08] Then. [119. 12-122.8 88] To Taiwan and Greater China for sale. [122. 88-125. 78] We will do some additional value-added services.

[125. 78-128. 06] Increase the value of our own. [128. 06-131. 68] This will be introduced again. [131. 68-135. 94] It was just a story that we had 57 years of history. [135. 94-138. 36] It was the last forty years. [138. 36-147. 08] We have always maintained a very good relationship with our supplier partners in Japan. [147. 08-148. 44] These.

[148. 44-158. 10] Japan's supplier partners include manufacturers of some very large raw materials in Japan. [158. 10-159. 84] just to name a few [159. 84-162. 12] Example.

[212. 52-214. 56] We make money every year. [215. 08-219. 42] And then we continue to pay dividends for cash dividends. [219. 68-222. 76] Then we grow with EPS.

[223. 26-226. 34] Dividends returned to shareholders are also gradually growing. [226. 60-228. 38] This is mentioned later. [229. 42-234. 54] The third point is our so-called capital. [234. 54-239. 14] There are currently close to 2.6 billion Taiwan dollars in capital. [239. 40-243. 50] This should be in 2023 24. [243. 76-246. 58] There is a slight difference in the two-year period.

[248. 10-252. 20] Growing up about 9 o'clock more party. [252. 46-255. 02] There was a slight arrest in the vicinity. [255. 28-258. 86] Faster 9 o'clock more party less than 10 party. [259. 12-260. 66] This is because we. [261. 16-264. 50] Four years ago there was a 2 billion issue. [264. 80-265. 56] Convertible.

[266. 08-267. 86] That's because of the stock price. [268. 38-268. 90] Good. [269. 40-272. 22] So these convertible bonds are all converted into share capital. [272. 48-274. 52] So the share capital has a slight expansion. [274. 78-278. 10] That's also because the share capital is slightly expanded on our relationship. [278. 36-279. 38] Marketcap [279. 64-281. 94] You can see that there is one here.

[282. 20-283. 48] Marketcap project. [283. 74-286. 56] Our current market capitalization is about 8 billion. [286. 82-288. 34] Multi-dollar. [288. 60-290. 90] This is me. [291. 16-293. 22] Should have been a couple of weeks ago. [293. 46-294. 50] Calculated.

[294. 80-295. 56] A little information. [295. 82-299. 14] That's because we didn't announce our May revenue yet. [299. 40-301. 96] I haven't updated this version of the slide yet. [302. 22-305. 80] That plus the last few days our stock price should be some ups. [306. 32-311. 70] So we should now be closer to one billion dollars in market capitalization. [311. 94-312. 98] Marketcap [313. 22-217. 06] In fact, we've also been breaking through in the past.

[317. 32318. 34] A billion. [318. 60-322. 18] is a threshold for a market value of USD 1 billion. [322. 70-323. 72] We. [323. 98-324. 50] uh. [324. 80-326. 08] The company here is certainly hope. [326. 34-328. 12] The stock price of the company can.

[328. 38-330. 68] gradually reflects the true value of our company. [331. 20-335. 04] Then it can reach a threshold of more than 1 billion USD. [335. 54-337. 60] This includes investors. [337. 86-339. 38] Some domestic investment legal persons. [339. 90-343. 74] When we look at foreign investment, we will feel like our company. [344. 00-345. 54] More aggressive.

[346. 04-346. 82] Because. [347. 06-351. 16] Basically there are some foreign or domestic investment funds. [351. 42-354. 50] The company they want to invest in basically needs to have a basic. [354. 80-355. 56] threshold of market capitalization. [355. 82-358. 12] Otherwise, the liquidity is with this. [358. 38-359. 40] Shareholding ratio.

[359. 66-360. 68] will be too high a problem. [360. 94-361. 70] This is possible. [361. 96-364. 78] Impact their investment decisions so we. [365. 04-366. 32] would hope our Marketcap. [366. 58-368. 10] can be gradually carried out.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: 368. 366-372. 46: A billion US dollar goal to buy.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph transcripts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription provided by the user in a few sentences, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

Then the next part is about the interpretation of the added value, which may require a separate segment. I need to identify the subject of each paragraph and combine the relevant sentence together. For example, the role of a FAE engineer and the part of the logistics service should be handled separately, as they discuss different added value.

In addition, the user mentions that there is a large time interval between some sentences, such as [923. 22-932. 70] and [950. 10-950. 86], which may mean the beginning of a transition or a new topic on the content. It is necessary to confirm whether these parts belong to the same paragraph, or whether they need to be segmented. During the process, I will check for duplicate or redundant information on a regular basis, but can not delete anything according to the user's request, so even if there is a duplicate, it is necessary to keep the structure. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of the sentence, ensure that the logic between paragraphs is smooth, such as after discussing with a FAE engineer, then discuss logistics services, and then turn to financial performance, such as is reasonable.

The following is the collated paragraph verbatim transcription (completely retains all the original content, adjusts only the paragraph structure): First of all, let's talk about revenue. From April to April. I want to report on this page that I just mentioned at the very beginning that all of our gorgeous add-on value can give us a steady foothold in this huge supply chain, and then become an important add-on value for our business partners, which is highly dependent on both our customers and suppliers.

The first is the role of a so-called FAE engineer at the top, where there is written to the role of FAE engineer, this is just what I just said, if today, for example, the suppliers of Japan to sell some advanced materials to the main production base in the Greater China region for manufacturing, if they go directly to the customer's site, they become the customer's FAE engineer, that is, the so-called manufacturing engineer, because our sales engineers, sales staff before introducing the products, they will also be Japanese factory to teach, they will understand all the materials in and out of the knowledge, product knowledge, they are also the role of PM. After returning to Taiwan, they can provide technical consulting services to customers, it is a very important role, this is a value-added service on the first technology.

As we all know, customers now almost do not leave the stock of raw materials, the stock of raw materials of customers is basically placed in the gorgeous here, we are gorgeous basically we will maintain the stock of raw materials of the month, is about a month of raw materials, customers always have a collection order, whether it is a collection order or a normal discharge of the single, he started production, as long as a few days, or even a week before we have a week before us gorgeous land, we can in a few days, we can look back at our province, even in China, we have our warehouse service system and office, can be close to provide services to customers, materials above the process. So basically, the customer can free, is not to prepare the stock of the stock of the stock of the stock of the year to us, is a lot of money, that we can not only pay back in 2014, if we need to get a lot of capital to buy a lot of a lot of the next year, we can do a lot of the next year, we can do a lot of them.

That was the only exception in 2022. The third quarter of 2022 was not a high revenue. So you should understand what happened in 2022 because of the disruption in the supply chain due to COVID. The first half of 2022 started to raise interest rates in the United States, so since then, the entire demand has declined rapidly, so the third quarter of 2022 has not been a high revenue. Then the second half of 2023 started a slight recession, and then the first quarter of 2023 also reached the bottom of this revenue, but by the second quarter of 23 began a slight recession, and we began to see the gradual rebound of revenue, which is a seasonality pad.

We can see from this column chart that we have several major revenue areas, the first is the blue ICT, the following legend, the first is the blue so-called ICT, basically the so-called information and communication technology, is our Chinese self-communication, the biggest industry in Taiwan is the so-called self-communication industry, then we are gorgeous in this industry, we are also a block with the highest proportion of our revenue. The second segment of the revenue is to grow to 30% by April, you can see that he still about 25% of the high-end semiconductor, Semi red, semiconductor industry, this year to April revenue he has reached 30% of the proportion, so you can see that the fastest revenue growth in this year to April is probably the semiconductor industry, and this is the next part of the green block is Apto-Electronics, here we write about the name of our internal sales department, but in fact, the business department of these products are basically LCD-related upstream raw materials and then there are some downstream and downstream parts of the product sales, that the proportion is about us to April, and that is less than that, I don't further describe it. The lens is more and more fluid, including this picture in the upper right corner of the lens module, because there are many lenses in the lens module, we know that the phone's pixel is more and more, the number of lenses needed in the lens, all these lens modules will be with us gorgeous here, the so-called optical-grade plastic to create a mold as the lens, so we know that the demand for this lens is more and more, whether it is a phone, or a variety of monitors, or even a variety of cameras on the car, the range of lens applications on the car is more and more, so this optical-grade plastic, the so-called parts used on the car will use more and more of this engineering plastic.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcription: Because of its lightweight and high strength, it can replace the previous metal as a replacement for auto parts. So there are more and more parts in the car, especially electric vehicles, there are a lot of connectors, relays, or power distribution pads, or motor pistons on your electric vehicle, and these will be used for our high-end engineering plastics.

The high-end engineering plastic I introduced here, and then I just came up with the PCB material that I would like to introduce. This is the PCB industry that accounts for 25% of the revenue in our ICT industry. The PCB industry also provides a lot of material, because the PCB manufacturing process uses a lot of film, film and some things that prevent it from connecting with each other, such as discrete film and so on.

This is a very small number of manufacturers in the world that can provide this high-resolution dry film, which is said to be a oligopolistic market. Basically, we are the exclusive leader of Huali here, Aae Cassette, or other Japanese manufacturers, basically by the two high-end manufacturers of dry film in the process. We are the exclusive leader of this Aae Cassette, the second important product is the so-called high-end substrate, high-frequency substrate.

This is a very high-level low impedance coefficient, they need this very high-level cobor substrate to do on their board, because this way they can do the fastest data transfer, then reduce the minimum data loss, and then the least power loss. So in this very high-level communication device, or server AI Server, like I just said, will use the high-level cobor substrates in Japan that we represent. So these two products account for roughly more than half of our PCB material revenue, so I don't do more of this product introduction here, but let's mention that in the PCB sector we also began to do some of the total solutions of some of the factory automation of some of the so-called factory automation 4. 0Factory Automation.

It is important to understand the importance of this, because the process of the semiconductor exposure line to do this is the circuit map, if you do not have enough precision optical resistance, you can not reach that wire ring, now you talk about several nanometers, two nanometers, the future to a few nanometers, this generation of this fine line width, you do not have to use a very high-level optical resistance to do so. Our JSR is the world's two or three, that is, the oligarch occupy the market, one of the manufacturers who can be able to provide such high-level optical resistance.

And then, finally, the advanced packaging material, which our JSA factory supplies to the customer's latest COWAS process, an important packaging material. Then, the advanced packaging material, which last year's growth rate was up to this double-digit growth, even to the three-digit growth, can see the customer's demand in this part of the demand is very strong. Semiconductor I first introduced here, it took a lot of time, and I tried to get a little faster. Then, the fourth industry is our so-called photoelectric industry, the flat-panel industry.

I just mentioned the next generation of electronic products, so the introduction of the next generation of electronic products, in fact, this electronic whiteboard. The electronic whiteboard is basically an electronic whiteboard, if you go to schools to observe, you can see that the school is gradually replacing the previous blackboard. In the past, you have to use the chalk to write something like dust, and then there is no interaction with the students, and now the progress of the times, all of them are gradually adopted this so-called electronic whiteboard. Basically, it is a large, probably more than 90 inches LCD display, and there will be even touch module.

As long as you have an HDMI connector connected to your video, you can make a slideshow right away. This is widely adopted in the enterprise or academia, so this e-whiteboard sales, we help customers to promote this sales channel around the world.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim provided in a manner that pays attention to the timestamp and the corresponding content. In the example given by the user, some sentences may be separated due to the interval of timestamps and need to judge how to merge into a natural paragraph according to the context. For example, [2652. 12-26566.656. 46] The above is an introduction to the product, and then [2656. 46-26567.2657. 24] The last, the two sentences clearly belong to the same paragraphs and should be merged.

At the same time, it is important to note that some sentences may be separated due to the pause or repeat of the speaker, such as [2664. 40-2666. 20] Southern Logistics Center and [2666. 20-2668. 24] This should be introduced to you, both of which should be together to form a complete sentence. In addition, users mention that there is a gap between timestamps, such as [2714. 12-2716. 68] and [2717. 24-2719. 28] There is a 6-second interval between [2714] and [2714. 12-2716. 68], which may indicate that the speaker has a pause or correction that needs to be in the same sentence.

For example, [2891. 52-2895. 36] Take a closer look at the absolute amount of money after this tax benefit and [2895. 36-2896. 64] Our growth rate is one, where there is an interval of 0.32 seconds in between, but it belongs to the same sentence and should be combined. After completing the initial merging, read the entire paragraph verbatim to check whether it is logical and smooth, and make sure that no original statement is missing. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to refer to the context or repeat the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the converted text accurately reflects the original structure and content.

This is the main source of our capital expenditures over the past three or four years. This is what I would like to show you in order to cooperate with the south logistics center, along with the development of semiconductor high-tech industries to the south, so I don't do much more. This is a very obvious trend. So why do you need to do this is obvious to the customer to the south to do the design. In the south, we are basically a base in Tainan, which covers more than 10,000 square feet, then we have seven warehouses, which even includes the cold storage and normal temperature storage.

So we are in the south of this logistics warehouse system to supply the future customers in the south of this very large development and a large part of the development. In fact, we also found that the south also has a need for this logistics. In fact, the south of this complete and advanced warehousing system is scarce in the south. So there are many manufacturers in the south, especially those in the chemical manufacturing industry, or other manufacturing levels, and they do not have a perfect warehouse space and logistics system for them to ship.

It is expected that the Southern Logistics Center should be able to be completed this year. Well, that product introduction and some qualitative introduction I will probably introduce here. Then I quickly brought some of our financial data, because it is the first quarter of the financial report, and now it is just published to the first quarter of the financial report, I think this is all public information, all available on the public information observation board, and I quickly skipped that part of our income statement.

So I believe that many of our customers in various industries will see that this attitude is relatively conservative. Therefore, the first quarter revenue performance is probably only in the number of revenue growth. That is, our EPS growth is probably the same as the growth of revenue, and there are about 7.8% growth. In fact, we take a closer look at the absolute amount of money after this tax return, our growth rate is higher than this figure, and our earnings growth is 16%.

We are the largest shareholder in the company, and we currently own about 57% of the company. The other is the owner of Nagase, the U.S. base engineering plastics, the agent of Nagase, the agent of Nagase, the agent of Asia, and the joint venture with him to establish a company called Changhua Plastic Priced Plastics, which is a subsidiary of Savik, which is a subsidiary of Savik, which is a subsidiary of Savik.

In the end, this consolidated balance sheet should be simple for our balance sheet, not too complicated for some of the subjects, we are basically a channel operator with receivables and inventory, then with payables, we can see clearly, and then the proportion is also the most important. Receivables inventory, everyone can see that about 6 billion, almost a portion of our current month's revenue. Then our debt ratio is about 4% of our total assets, I think we can do a comparison with our peers, the debt ratio should be relatively conservative, we are a relatively conservative financial operation. This page refers to the return of our shareholders, we can see that we grow EPS every year, our cash dividends are also the annual growth, basically our cash distribution ratio is about 55% to 60% of EPS.

1. Reorganize paragraphs according to semantic and stream. 2. Undelete, rewrite, or consolidate anything, only adjust the order of the statements to conform to natural reading habits. 3. Keep all repeats, pauses, and statement intervals (such as "this is very large"), in line with the original text of the script.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript: [3134. 58-3136. 64] Cash dividend per share 5.3%. Although our EPS did not grow last year, we have raised this year's cash dividend to 5.3. Basically, we hope that we can provide a better return on investment to shareholders, and hope that we can improve the parts of our stock price.

This is a change in the gross profit margin, the top is the change in the gross profit margin, and our gross profit margin is basically within the range of 7 to 8%. The net profit margin is probably also maintained at this level of about 3%, so the ROE has a slight decline trend due to a small expansion of the share capital in recent years.
