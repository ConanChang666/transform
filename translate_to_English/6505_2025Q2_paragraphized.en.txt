In the first half of this year's tax year, the total profit reached $181.1 billion, and as of the end of July 2007, it was the fourth largest in the industry to maintain its absolute leadership among public equity financial institutions. The bank's subsidiary, as of the first half of the year, reached $163.69 billion, and the business indicators were very prominent. The steady expansion of the exchange business increased by 5%, mainly benefiting from the increase in the credit demand of government agencies, public sector and large enterprise groups.

Foreign exchange A5 is also very strong, the first half of the year has increased by 9%, mainly due to the increase in demand for trade settlement in large multinational technology groups, as well as the contribution of fixed deposit projects. The financial management business is in line with the government's Asia High Asset Management Center policy, and the performance is also very good. The AVM has reached 211.2 billion yuan in the first half of the year, and the financial management business first step will increase revenue by 3%, and the profit dynamic continues to improve.

In the first half of the year, the net profit of the sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub

In the second half of the year, Hwang Financial Holdings will continue to deepen the digital financial services, help SMEs to maintain the exchange rate risk, and actively promote the new business of Kaohsiung Jade Center, expand the global supply chain, and actively cooperate with the government's financial policy, and strive to become the integrated financial services partner of customers' choice. Next, let's take a look at the financial and business profile of Hwang Financial Holdings as the second quarter of this year, and explain the three key indicators: L1, LA and EPS.

The annualized L1 of our company reached 10.02 percent in the first half of this year, with an annualized LA of 0.79% and EPS of 1.23 per cent. The capital adequacy ratio of 133.84% was significantly higher compared to the previous year. The other double-run ratio was 119.04 per cent. Some of our subsidiaries had a capital adequacy of 16.97 per cent, low class adequacy adequacy adequacy adequacy ratio of 14. 69% and a normal equity capital adequacy ratio of 14. 55%.

In addition, the Sub-Fund's capital adequacy ratio of 13.4%, 583. 57%, and 317. 65% of its securities subsidiaries are substantially above the minimum standard, indicating that the Group's capital strength is solid. As a result, the balance of our loans in the second quarter of this year was 2.3 trillion and the growth rate of YY reached 2.7%.

In fact, the loan performance to date is good. That's the annual growth rate of 4.5% for mortgages. There is also a 7% growth rate for other mortgages. For the lending trend in different industries, we observed the current domestic capital demand and balanced distribution.

The annual growth rate of loans in the transportation and communications industry is 10.3%. That is, if we look at the region, the needs of overseas funds, as we have just mentioned, because it is a part of the US dollar, will be affected by the depreciation of the US dollar in the second quarter of this year.

The growth rate of that quarter is also 1.4%. That part of the foreign currency is due to the US dollar, as mentioned in the second quarter because of the US dollar depreciation, then the loan is converted to Taiwan dollars, and the growth rate is actually changed from negative. If the exchange rate is negative, then the US dollar has a good YY growth rate of about 7%, or half has a growth rate of about 5%.

The overall survival of the second quarter also increased significantly by 1. 77% compared to the previous quarter, up to 47.97%. This increased the performance of NIM by improving the cost structure of the entire fund. The second quarter held more than 76.92%, mainly because of the increase in the balance of the loan, which led to a decline in the balance of the deposit. The balance of the dollar held remained at about 39%.

That part of the NIM, in fact, is quite stable to keep up with the quarter. The NIM showed a growth trend, up by 6 BPs from the previous quarter, up by 1.19%. The wealth management revenue in the second quarter of this year reached 11.03 billion yuan. Now, if we look at this product line analysis, the silver bond has grown significantly by 30% over the same period last year, and the storage costs have also increased by 13%.

In the first half of this year, the bank accounted for 42.4 billion yuan for the first half of this year, and the second half of that year there were about 20.1.9 billion yuan for the first half of the year. If the number of revenues for the first half of this year, in fact, the first half of this year, there was a growth rate of about 1%. If the quality of assets, the current NP ratio was 0.2 26%, which was a decrease of 1 BP in the previous quarter, about 4.7 billion. That coverage has reached 648.76%, which has risen by about 39 percentage points from the previous quarter.

The above is the second quarter of this year's financial and business overview report, followed by some financial reports and appendix information, please investors and media friends reference, thank you. The present briefing is here to tell a paragraph, then go to the next stage of the Q&A. Please ask the investors and our media friends, if you have any questions, you can enter your questions in the lower right-hand column of this screen, we will be waiting for a unified reply, thank you.

I want it here.

** Introduction to the China Merchants 2025 development plan**. In this fierce market competition, China Merchants Group decided to adopt a strategy to strengthen the cooperation of double-engineer banking documents,.bank subsidiaries will remain at the core position, and the document subsidiaries will gradually increase the importance. According to the group's objectives, the profitability of the bank subsidiaries should be stable to 80% to 90%, and will continue to adjust the conversion results.

In addition, we will focus on high-growth industries such as TSMC, supply and AIS. The exchange of funds will focus on products such as financial services and loans. ** Diversified profit and capital structure optimization**. The document subsidiary will become a key enabler of the Group's diversification of profit, and will be more active in IPO underwriting and in-depth in high net worth customer wealth management. Long-term goal is to achieve the G-Percent Group's profit contribution weight. ** Cross-border cooperation and data sharing**, we expect to continue to improve the efficiency of the Group through cross-border cooperation and data sharing.

In addition, through overseas and strategic transformation, we will be able to expand with volume in 18 economies and 39 seasons. **Business optimisation and talent training**. In particular, Trump tariff policy and supply chain restructuring have brought us three major shifts: Taiwan's investment in credit demand, cross-border financing services and overseas safekeeping business growth.

Other subsidiaries will optimize the business strategy and resource allocation through the financial management company. **Sustainability and commercial banking layout**. China Merchants Group will use a robust operation as the cornerstone, through commercial banks to launch overseas deep-distribution layout, to optimize the allocation of resources, and create a stable profit growth momentum. **Future outlook and market evaluation**

The Bank's Vice President said that in terms of the bank's production progress, the bank had already pre-approval to complete the general remodeling part of the country at the end of June last year and reviewed it using the FIRB law. At present, the progress is smooth, and the field review is expected to be carried out by next year. But in terms of business application, the FIRB law can further categorize the credit risk of corporate customers by internal credit equality models, so that more accurate risk assessment and pricing capabilities to optimize the efficiency of the risk-based pricing and capital utilization.

**Investment momentum and business outlook**. China Merchants Bank Vice President, said that in 2015, loans will focus on project financing, supply chain finance, and more.

The future will be more aggressive towards AI supply chain migration, project financing, large-scale public infrastructure, and high-yielding projects. Finally, we will continue to monitor market dynamics to prepare for future risks and challenges.

Cathay functions as well as expansion. Important cases such as the southwest. The remaining balance for leaving the feudal letter as of the end of July 2025 is close to NT$2 billion.

The future will continue to be a bank subsidiary. Even with the focus on business development, there are many media friends and legal persons. For example, Starfish, Business Times. All the questions are related. We recently released overseas branches.

Some consolidated news follow-up. Want to know what we have for this. Some detailed planning of the censorship program. And especially for overseas businesses. The trend of profit and growth can be shared further. For example, a supply chain like a Taiwanese business.

There are also a few supply chain migrations. I don't know if there are plans to add an overseas branch. About this question. I also asked the bank to take the vice president to answer. Well, first of all, the bank's subsidiary.

The main focus is on improving overall business efficiency. As well as strategic considerations of resource utilization efficiency. Consolidation is mainly focused on the same location as the blockchain business.

And the ability to expand the market. The future business of the raw materials base will be received by the management of the same block or branch. Ensure that the service will not be interrupted. And continue to support local brands and existing customer rights. It is also the second quarter of this year overseas branches and treasury branches.

The most advanced gold medal is 37.1 billion yuan. Compared to the same period last year, gold medal is 54.5 billion yuan. It has reduced gold medals 17.4 billion yuan. The growth of overseas profits is the main driving force. It is from Hong Kong and New Southbound countries. Mainly due to the cooperation of bank subsidiaries at home and abroad.

Guide clients to manage their funds using our cross-border platform. Increase deposits and make good use of their funds in a credit-worthy business. Maintain a certain margin, while overseas profits are relatively backward. It is the fourth U.S. business.

Mainly because of the increase in commercial real estate schedules. And the U.S. interest rate is still high. This business borrowing demand is relatively weak. Bank subsidiaries in the United States, Japan, India.

In the future, Sino-Taiwan companies will move to capital demand for stocks. Evaluate planning for new locations. In addition, with the increasing demand for digital services in recent years, the bank's subsidiaries continue to optimize the global financial network. Cross-border funding overlap. Financial services to meet the needs of overseas investors.

What is the impact of our bank on the financial. What is the strategy above risk management. This question again asks the bank's dealing officer. Try to answer. In terms of financial impact.

Bank subsidiary OBU and overseas bank profit account for about 30% of the near-term. However, due to the proper allocation of assets and liabilities, the overall effect of the appreciation of the currency is limited. According to the exchange rate sensitivity analysis. If the appreciation of the currency is 10%. The estimated impact of the year-round profit is only about 3%.

The exchange yields for the first quarter of this year were NT$7.4 billion and NT$7.3 billion respectively. The exchange rate fluctuations did not significantly affect the short-term rate. The average monthly net profit for foreign currencies in the first half of this year was approximately NT$25 million. The net profit after the average monthly tax of the US dollar parts was approximately NT$15 million.

The proportion is 60%. Assessing the impact of NT$1 appreciation on US dollars on monthly profit of approximately NT$25 million. The total annual impact is only NT$300 million. Therefore NTNT has little financial impact on bank subsidiaries. In terms of risk management strategy.

Foreign currency assets are mainly subject to foreign currency liabilities. They are operated through FXDOT. Ensure that the asset liabilities are risk-free. Foreign currency assets extend near interest income.

Finally on the quality of assets. The expected amount of leave at the end of the second quarter of the bank's subsidiary is approximately NT$5.9 billion. The reserve ratio is 0.2 26%. The reserve ratio is NT$4.47 billion lower than the first quarter. The reserve ratio is down 0.1%. The quality of assets continues to be improved.

The bank subsidiary will continue to pay attention to the value of the USD exchange rate. As well as the changes in the international economic situation, and adopt a prudent and financial response strategy. To maintain the stability of the asset quality.

There is also an investment strategy. It is not possible to share further. Good question I asked the bank manager to answer. Well. In the size of the securities investment section. As of the second quarter of this year, we have accounted for the total asset portion of the securities site.

7% in terms of the allocation of the securities position. The Bank invests in foreign currency positions to account for approximately 75% of the entire securities position. The overall allocation ratio. The transitional part within 5 years accounts for 77% of the shares.

In addition to the investment strategy. Consider the current currency sensing environment changes. Therefore, the Bank adopts a flexible way of dealing in securities. The U.S. Treasury Bonds. It is expected that the suspension of the five-year tax reform bill will increase the next day of the U.S. fiscal year.

The long-term bond rate is expected to grow at a high level. That is why we operate our strategy to shorten the deposit period. The tighter the process is to make capital gains with volatility operations. Properly coupled with real-time interest rate bonds.

Pursue stable income. Control interest rates and credit risk. Meet shareholder expectations. Above. Good.

Again, a lot of investment media friends have asked us about some of our views on mortgage land. Ask. Ask. Ask. Ask the VP of the bank to answer. In response to the ongoing implementation of real estate loans by the competent authority this year. The bank continues to reduce real estate.

The performance part of the mortgage business. The balance of the second quarter of the mortgage is $42.5 billion. The balance of the small credit is $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year. The balance of the small credit is $1.4 billion, which has grown 3 billion.

For the provisions of Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, the Bank adopts a whole line of business coordinating planning to govern. Mortgage-free purchases are given priority to mortgage-free purchases. Ensure that the customer needs for hand-made purchases are up-to-date with the number of control lines. Our approval policy is developed by participating in the industry. The highest credit score in six is 80% equivalent to that of the industry.

As our mortgages are hand-purchased by our customers, they are less affected by credit control measures. The recent mortgage prevention ratio is maintained at a stable low level. The U.S. tariff policy may affect the employment market in Taiwan.

All mortgage cases are in line with the five-P principle of trust. Observe the data for nearly three months. The Bank's upfront mortgage payments do not increase significantly. Show that the Bank's lockdowns work well. Modern products strictly control the trend of revitalization. Avoid being used to expand the loan to protect the borrower's credit overarching.

Well, again, there is a counter-questioning that we're on a deposit this year. For example, a growth strategy like this one. What kind of idea is going on with how to absorb some of the low-interest funds in the future. This question still asks the bank to build the vice president to answer it. That's the part of this deposit asset rate performance.

NT$3.03 trillion Increases by 1% compared to the same period last year. Maintains a stable level. Foreign exchange deposits are 1.7% higher than NT$1.21 trillion. To maintain poor storage capacity.

The water level of the deposit will maintain a steady growth. The strategic focus of the deposit business will be on three fronts. The first is the natural energy deposit. Increase the competitiveness of new customers. Expand the freighter channel. The second is the SME deposit.

Increase your account opening and business operations through our supply chain financing platform. All natural and SME deposits are low-interest deposits. Its capital costs are relatively controllable. The third is that we add different levels of deposits to our TMU business operations based on liquidity needs.

The legal person has asked questions such as unified, KGI and UBS securities. The question is about our current performance of NIM. Follow the strategy of the future, follow the optimization strategy. There is also some impact on our NIM if the interest rate decreases.

The average NIM of a good bank in the first half of this year was 0.95 billion. Compared to the same period last year, it was down $0.03 billion in percentage points. The main interpersonal figures were higher than the net deposit ratio of the U.S. dollar. But a block rate in the U.S. dollar has declined.

This leads to a decline in NIM. This results in a performance that affects the Bank's NIM. We will start with three major aspects to improve the NIM performance.

First of all, we need to continuously optimize the conversion structure. Expand small and medium enterprises and individuals who have better profits and trust businesses. To increase the margin of deposit.

Second, a shift trend that is met. Actively grasp the opportunities in the Tokyo overseas market. Expand the high-interest business. Thirdly, in terms of bond investment business.

Bonds with variable interest rates at the same time. Gradually increase the yield of foreign currency portfolios. And receive stable interest income. Quantitative impact on NIM and central bank rate cuts.

We will pay close attention to the trend of interest rate changes. The fact of adjusting the strategy of asset-balance allocation. In a low-lying environment. The ability to maintain stable profitability.

Now the legal person has asked. Some of the differences received in the first half of the year. Looking forward to the future.

This year. As of the second quarter. Earnings were $42.1 billion. The same period last year was 10.04 billion. Mainly affected by positive factors. That is, the compensation for a one-time high-speed rail interest received in January was 10.4 billion.

But this year is no longer. If this one-time discount. If this one-time discount. If this one-time discount is a factor, take a look at this one-time discount. In one of the procedures in the business. On the performance of the handling fee. On the performance of the handling fee.

The 2025 year-round financial management asset size target is NT$6.7 billion. That reached NT$28.7 billion at the end of June. The yield was 45%. The competitive yield target was NT$6463 billion. That has been achieved at 617 million. The yield is 96%.

The Bank will also continue to optimize its operating platform. It is located in the Southern District of North Central. It works closely with branches to develop the power of licensing. As for participation in the Asia-Pacific region, the Bank is actively responding to the policy of the Asia-Pacific region. On April 28, it applied to the HKMA for five regional demonstrations.

June 19. That's July 1. The private team has moved into the Hong Kong Governor's branch. The business covers the Telecommunications Trust. Cash policy financing and other projects. And it has been evaluated to select 30 fund commodities.

Private equity. Private equity. Currency funds. Diversified commodities such as foreign exchange strategies. A private model is demonstrated through a dedicated demo. A more complete asset solution for high net worth clients.

Ok, I asked for this question to answer. Well. The bank's trading revenue for the first half of this year was $967.72 billion. That was a decrease of 14.32% compared to the same period last year. The main reason is two. The first is a Taiwan-based weighted index in June.

At the beginning of the year, 779 points fell. A decline was 3.38%. That was a rise of 5101 points in the same period last year. A rise of 28. 45%. To make a comparison to form a strong contrast.

That year's operating position of 900 million yuan. That compared to the same period last year, it was a decrease of 13.08 billion yuan. That second factor. This factor mainly led to a decrease in interest rates in the United States and Taiwan.

That was a decrease of $41.9 billion compared to the same period last year. Another uncertainty in the face of the U.S. added. There are several aspects to our response. That is, in terms of financial operations.

A dividend can be collected for one purpose of investment. It is also a principal. The other part of the transaction is for the purpose of a part. It will be maintained at a lower level. The operation of a range is carried out. To earn capital gains.

Avoid a volatile market to impact a profit. That's on a recurring investment strategy. Consider that every generation in the future will present one. A trend of high-end volatility. A more cautious action will be taken. A flurry of fixed interest rates.

Reduce the duration of the activity. And match the activity rate to the change. Take into account the risk of income and ventilation.

In addition, in response to Trump's policies. A policy of government-to-equity tariffs. Intensifying market volatility. The strategy adopted by the Bank is a prudent selection.

This is the outlook of the industry. Market conditions and liquidity. Actively reduce the CLO position in batches. Closely market fluctuations have an impact on earnings.

At the same time, the positive reassessment of the new investment case. The opportunity to maintain a profit-making momentum.

In the first half of this year, the amount of such debt is added to the current year. The amount of such debt may need to be withdrawn in the future. Or some amount or opinion of the expected recovery, etc.

OK about this question. I ask the Director of Banking and Lending, Mr. Lai, to answer the question. It is a case of negotiating invalid cases. We will act in accordance with the law to protect the debt. Or start a single high selling process. That goes through this multiple channel.

It is expected that there will be no other need for the second half of this year. There will be a significant increase in the deposit-taking lending case. The lender has been credited with a steady trend. The bad debt may be recovered in the second half of this year. There is also a salary of $21.6 billion.

This will create a contribution to the life of the broker's filtering. The broker is rigorously audited with confidence. The perfect single insurance management. With active collection policy. That effectively controls the risk of the asset's emergency. The metal integration demand is relatively limited.

That's the expected recovery amount. This will keep the credit cost above the reasonable level. Well, today's Q&A time. Let's go here first because of the time relationship. We can't answer all your questions.
