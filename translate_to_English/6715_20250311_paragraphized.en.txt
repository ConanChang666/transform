Hello everyone, thank you for your visit. I am very happy to invite you to this forum. First of all, I would like to introduce you to the team of Jiaqi: this is Mr. Hu Zhiqiang, the vice president number. Hello everyone.

This is the first part of our comprehensive income statement: the combined revenue in 2024 is 2.2 billion 4, the 2023 is 2.4 billion 5, the annual decrease is 2 billion, and the YYC payment is 29. The main reason is because the transmission part, we here because of the need of the entire PC, so we become the output of the output of our electricity transmission is slightly lower. The light communication part, also in the server's light communication cable, because the needs of our customers here, so there is a growth in the portion of the light communication, is probably a double-digit number, the revenue ratio is about 10 of the principal value of the last year.

The gross profit in 2023 is 36%, and the gross profit in 2024 is 38% growth. The main part is because of the change in the entire national transmission, which is mainly due to the optimization of the whole production process, and then there are some improvements in the process, so in that part of the consumables, there is a decline in the working rate, and there is a decrease in the amount of the gross profit in the whole product.

That is, there is a one-off cash increase employee compensation fee list, and that is because we just mentioned that our factory here in Thailand has officially invested in a production line at the time last year, there is some business expenses generated here, which is probably the cost of this level of more than 20 million. So the whole point of view, business benefits in the last year was 3,400 million, so the entire tax before last year was 4,7 million, the net profit of that company is 3,4 billion, compared to the 2023 part is a slight decline of 5,5 million. The net interest rate part is 15%, or less than 15%.

This is why we bought this plant at the end of the year because we bought an existing plant at a neutral plant at the end of last year, which was about 713 in response to the fact that when we raised money at the beginning of last year, it was mainly used to operate the plant in our own part, because at the end of the year we saw a more suitable existing plant at a neutral plant, so we bought a 518 in the end of the year. That is why we bought a real estate at the end of the year.

And then I'll report to you the analysis of the cash flow statement: the cash flow of our current month to the end of the year is 80 million, which is just mentioned here is that our issuance of convertible bonds and cash increase here is 713, which was around 2002 last year. In the whole view, our business activity last year was net flow to 6006 million. That's just mentioned in the investment part, we have to buy the plant and some automation equipment, where the investment activity here is net flow 7 billion, net flow is 9004 million million. The whole overall is to the end of the year's cash flow to the end of the part is 1.488 million, which is now our cash status.

This is as explained by the Chief Financial Officer, we have built this plant in this factory.



The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. I just want to change it to playphone. Change it to the so-called big head of the DP. This is also being tested with the Visa location. The current situation is whether it is the Type-C connector or the DP connector, the specifications for Visa are all in line with its specifications.

Of course, this part of why it goes to DP because of the free-line time mentioned earlier Luster, it is more efficient when it comes to production. This is what it does, it can get a cheaper solution for guests. That's what we're doing in support of some guests, including the AMD they're going to do some of the testing of that graphic card, which we're now saying is that we're already working with them for docking and testing. Of course, Pentagraph runs at a higher speed, because it's already up to 120G, so it should be something you've already mentioned before.

In fact, frankly speaking everything is ready, now is a small place with Intel's whole process and its found resource to test. The current situation looks good, but at the moment it is not meant to be launched in Q2. But I feel that it may be put to Q3, because some guests of the monitor is not completely good, so its time has become a bit more pressure later. So it may be put in the future, so this part of the fifth monitor should look like we only know that there are two RFKs out this year, so it really isn't so early.

This is the cable list of mass production, so in fact, four parts should not be without problems. Five parts are to see when the Acid part will be good, and the other one is to say that the support specification is a bit different. One is Vendable 4 Acid, it is supported to DP1. 4a, and the other can support to DP2. 1, so this is just to supportDP2. 1 of the Data Rate, we will use this to DP Certified.

But to be honest, the price of this one is still high, and the use of this scenario in comparison to this particular situation doesn't seem to be completely broken at the moment, because Nuser's flat ring is not so high. This is some special use, but you can see that it is all part of the growth of the ring, because all of the commercial customers are Generation a Generation fixed in the elimination model or upgrade. So the most part of this growth curve can be seen is that this portion of the Dunking Cable and Adentum are equipped with cable, so in this part we see that when we look at this picture, it looks like there are no cables, because the cable we are part of it is going to Adept there.

Now we can see that there are other Adenum cards, such as the Graphic Card, which is also estimated in the region, which looks to be the largest, because after all, in the North American part, they push the switch slot and the big business and government departments that the switch slot is fixed. So it looks like North America will still be a large proportion, which is actually a breakdown here in the planning.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to confirm each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. Then, I need to group these sentences in logical and contextual contexts to form a coherent paragraph. For example, the price considerations may need to be merged into a paragraph, while the product specifications may be separated. Next, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sentences in each paragraph are coherent over time.

In addition, technical terms such as "Stingloss Products" and "DP2.1 Specification" mentioned by the user need to retain the original, without any modification. During the processing process, I need to avoid any personal explanations or summaries, only structural adjustments. For example, the term "DP54" and "DP80" mentioned by the user must be preserved accurately and arranged in the order of appearance. At the same time, pay attention to the connection between the sentences, such as "So", "Of course", etc., to maintain the original logical relationship.

In addition, the user-provided transcripts have some time interval between stamps, such as [1620. 40-1622] to [1622. 40-1624. 40], which may indicate the transition of the topic and need to be noted during the segmentation. For example, from a price discussion to a product introduction, it should be separated by empty lines or paragraphs. Finally, after completing the initial segmentation, I will read the entire paragraph transcript, check if there are missing sentences or wrong paragraphs, and ensure that all sentences are properly preserved and in accordance with the user's requirements.

The second is also because of the price consideration. Because the 140W Power Deliver is cheaper, so when they are sold together, it is a 140W.

The trend of the market. Of course, 240W will do it. Because the price of the whole price is rising. So we are now observing. Fendable 4 part. Then 240W is done.

It's time to do the 240W directly. Make this module for Fendable 5. This is really Dependent on. The price is on the side of the panel. It's the same as DP2. 1.

Now we see the price of this monitor, no cost. Good thing this is another new one. It's our new Stingloss product. That's what we're using now.

That's what we're talking about. Big DP head. It can now be Mit's specification. There are three kinds of DP2.

One is called DP54. One is called DP80. One is called DP80 Low-Rose. Of course, DP54 is the most basic specification. At present, the most customers will push this monitor.

Compared to this panel, it is more effective. It is acceptable. Then again, DP80. The DP80 is common. This 80K 60Hz.

10K 30Hz. That is the part. The number of millimeters is generally longer than the number of millimeters. It is certain to be Active. If it is test, it is very rough.

That is what we do for our clients. That is what we do for our clients. When we do for our clients, we can make our production easier and talk to our clients as well.

It's not too bad to persuade a guest to flat lines. It's the Conformance above. It's OK to test a customer at the moment. It's OK to persuade him. Use habits. Because the usual habit is circular lines.

There is no mention of this in the Qur'an or the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but there is no mention of this in the Qur'an or the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

He has a certain amount of it, but if I do, he is a single source, so we also try to convince guests that there is no problem with the guest test.

This is also in the effort at the moment. That is why there is DP80 Low-Loss. This part is mainly in line with the MVE there. It sets out the requirements required for Visa. It cannot tell the specification.

That part is about the Low-Loss part. Its length can be 1 meter from the original. It becomes only 0.65. The specification that it requires is higher. This part is actually. We are not sure what is going on behind it.

But what we can say is that the demand is yes, but not necessarily, it will be done in the short term, because of the specification. In fact, the customer has been adjusting.

This is the dharma of the dharma, and the dharma of the dharma is the dharma of the dharma, and the dharma of the dharma of the dharma is the dharma of the dharma of the dharma.

For example, the Data-Loss section. But it looks like if you want to do Low-Loss. Use Active. Because it is active.

It is written on PayPal. At least it is 0. 65 too short. It may be the machine to use the machine. But you have to go to In-User's hand.

Currently, as mentioned above, we have been up to 800G. Currently, we are following customers.

That's 800G. In fact, I opened two Playforms. QSMP, DDT and OSMP. But at the moment it looks. It will be accepted by the guests.

It's probably going to OSMP. The QSMP part is actually used. It's not very much. That's because the AOC part is what we're seeing now. That's ProCAM.

Or the one. Some Component at Mavio. It's a bit slow. So, let's not let guests. Idle is too long. With its testing, the soft part.

We will use this DECK. To go to a fullfill customer's needs. In fact, part of the DECK we will also use. Point to do.

This output performance. Efficiency is relatively high. That is, of course, some Post. I can give free days to guests. But the most important thing is that. For high-frequency performance performance.

We're going to try this now. The point line is good or bad. But the same. We're the longest right now. It's supposed to be 2.5m. That's the part of cashing.

We will also try to do it. We hope it can be done with this general tradition. This TuneX thread is processed. That part of the 1. 6T should be there. We will have some samples in April.

This is the guest. SERVER on the verifier. That's true right now. 1. 6T to test. There are some difficulties, because there are a lot of devices out there.

It's not perfect either. So I can only use it. We can only use part of this instrument first full guest. The idea above in this performance. After that, the machine took it.

Let's go back to the previous test and compare this one to the previous one.

[1932. 40-1934. 40] Summarize [1934. 40-1936. 40] This is actually a brief summary. [1936. 40-1938. 40] The following is a brief summary of what it is like to write about 1. 6T to 224G. [1938. 40-1940. 40] The main thing to mention is that we have another part of the inner line, no matter the outer line. [1940. 40-1942. 40] These internal lines also use similar materials to this design to meet this client's end-to-end needs. [1942. 40-1944. 40] This link is good.

[1944. 40-1946. 40] This is what we will do for this part of the internal line. [1946. 40-1948. 40] The left hand side of the talk has two lines, one called TuneX, and one called SlimLuster. [1948. 40-1950. 40] One is a point line, and one is a conventional line. [1950. 40-1952. 40] That we actually do in the MCIO's Interface according to the needs of our customers. [1952. 40-1954. 40] Genz SlimLusterSource or our own SlimLuster Connector. [1954. 40-1956. 40] is the Optical Engine mentioned later.

[1956. 40-1958. 40] The recent one or two customers at push we made a sample to make this machine match. [1958. 40-1960. 40] This will probably be repeated later. [1960. 40-1962. 40] This part is what we said earlier in support PCIe. [1962. 40-1964. 40] The current limit should be to PCIe 6. [1964. 40-196. 40] To 6, the specification is almost exactly what the PCIe Association requires. [1964. 40-1968. 40] Therefore, it is also the most aggressive test for customers.

[1968. 40-1970. 40] Well, here I mentioned the length I could do when I was in PCIe 5 and 6. [1970. 40-197.2. 40] That's the part that looks like 5 I can do with 0.9 9m, and 6 is about 0.8. [1972. 40-1974. 40] That's why I had to test PCIe 7 with some customers before. [1974. 40-1976. 40] In fact, the customer also didn't think that I could only use the existing performance to estimate it. [1976. 40-1978. 40] That's the fact that you really need to shorten the length of your PCIe 7 is only 40cm. [1978. 40-1980. 40] That's what we've seen is that we've been talking about before about whether you're going to optical.

[1980. 40-1982. 40] That really doesn't seem to be a big conclusion at the moment. [1982. 40-1984. 40] That's right, we're assuming we're doing this flat line design for a few guests on the app. [1984. 40-1986. 40] This is the practice that Intel had proposed three to four years ago that he'd put in the board-to-table connection: CPU in Nodebook to the coastline. [1986. 40-1988. 40] In fact, he said that it was a long time ago that some customers bought this design, including the connector's design and Cable's design. [1988. 40-1990. 40] I've found that it's going to be divers too expensive because Intel's Initial design I're now trying to make some Fyteam and revisions. [1990. 40-1992. 40] Let's be able to use this design to apply it to the client's specification that it to include performance and the space.

[1992. 40-1994. 40] That's what we're talking about right now, but we're still confident in our Cable, but the Connector now has to re-open or find a ready-made Mit client. [1994. 40-1996. 40] Because it's the board that's on the board that I'm going to cover with my Cable. [1996. 40-1998. 40] This is what we're currently working on with with this special design. [1998. 40-2000. 40] This is what ForNodebook was mentioned before. [2000. 40-2002. 40] The ForServer part of the ForNodebook is actually focused or our comment line is able to go to the ForFuel client's design on this server. [2002. 40-2004. 40]

[2004. 40-2006. 40] Because there is a silver line in front of the thickness. [2006. 40-2008. 40] The thickness is about 6. 5mm the traditional TwinX TwinSpare line is actually about 8.7mm. [2008. 40-2010. 40] So if it is to use the traditional line to do it the entire height of the entire height of the whole including space and wind-flow cooling will be affected. [2010. 40-2012. 40] This Emerging Cooling should have been mentioned before. [2012. 40-2014. 40] This cold test is currently in progress. [2014. 40-2016. 40] The material should be adjusted by PFAS.

[2016. 40-2018. 40] But the current status of the test includes the three customers in the different oil bubbles for the car is OK. [2018. 40-2020. 40] This is only a question that customers really need to use. [2020. 40-2022. 40] It is a trend that some of the exhibits and seminars have seen. [2022. 40-2024. 40] But no one has a focus on how to damage repairs. [2024. 40-2026. 40] There is a certain level of maintenance in your back and you need to have a machine like a tank inside. [2026. 40-2028. 40] There is a lot of mass production, but I have heard that the corporate image to mass production shows that I have a useful oil cold that this so-called green indicator is not wasted energy.

[2028. 40-2030. 40] But that is a small part of what we are doing so we are also looking at how long to get results. [2030. 40-2032. 40] Because it may be better for you to talk about it outside. [2032. 40-2034. 40] Because we are also hesitant to do this. [2034. 40-2030. 40] Because so many oil products are going to do what I want to do. [2036. 40-2030. 40] Because every customer chooses oil that is different is called CPC. [2038. 40-2030. 40] Because the last discussion about the CPO is why the article is copper.

[2040. 40-2042. 40] The main reason is the cost plus the acceptance of the guest and its application scene. [2042. 40-2044. 40] This is done with the domestic switch manufacturers.

If we have some design, whether it is CPC interconnect, then it has transparent type and steel loss type, that is, like our internal line, we talk about it will do some conversion, the conversion is the same material, what can I do with it, of course, it is in this part of the material, we still focus in these two, because it is better to control, that is, the progress is now done, is that we are doing a comparison EVV design, the test situation, then it will be discussed, what is the next step with the customer's design team, that is to change, that is, because now every customer's request is different, will be like this, the preliminary idea is, the reverse do not connect, is gold finger, and then my line is directly attached, this solution, here to overcome the customer can not be able to accept, because assembly is to overcome, but this is to the same thing, but is a lot of the problem, if it is the same, if it is the same, it is the same, but because it is to do it is to do it is the same, it is to do it is the same, it is the same, if it is to do it is to do it is the same thing, it is the same thing, if it is the same thing, if it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is to do it is the same thing, it is the same thing, it is to do it is to do it is to do it is to do it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is the same, it is a new, it is a new, it is the same, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is to do it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a way, it is a new, it is a new, it is a way, it is a way, it is a way, it is a way, it is a new, it is a new, it is a new, it is a If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your needs, we can provide you with the information you need. If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your needs, we can provide you with the information you need. If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your needs, we can provide you with the information you need.

If you are looking for a product that is suitable for you, please contact us. If you are looking for a product that is not suitable for you, please contact us.

Some customers need to be a little bigger, then a little bit more, then a little bit more, also called plug. The design is not the same, it is called plug, the mold is also back, so the cost will be more, in these places. But also to see there is no way to a few customers unified, to do it in a pattern, which is also in an effort. That is the part of the copper wire.

It will be very close, will do two things to each other this cover. CPC part, the previous mentioned CPC, it will only do this paragraph, the end, so it is not long. So if I do this here, I am here light engine, I directly help you to turn to the light, it goes to the coastline pull, the coastline outside this side, I use standard, for example, NTP head, or MPO head, direct to the next server, is the external contact area. So it can save all the middle of the low, with some of the inside, including some of the FileControl.

I made a phototype test, then adjusted the size of the front CPC, so I will talk about CPC's practice with this OBO application, there is a very large correlation. So I will talk about CPC's practice with this OBO application, this is actually made a phototype, it should be 400G test, the next stage is to do 800G. 800G is also done, the hope is Q3, because it corresponds to the guest, its EVB Port, it is some PIN confirmation, so this is at least now the customer is acceptable.

This is the size that we have in Initial, so you have to put a few light pianos inside. Here we see this is the light piano. Well, this is the actual, the actual picture that we do in the guest room, that is, I'm connected here, connected to my light, this POPIO, straight to the opposite side of the coastline. Of course, I'll have two forms, one I'm a gold finger, and the other one I'm going to pull out of this comment line.

That's at least the proof that this app works, and of course, the advantage is that I can put the light piano as close as possible to the so-called side of the board. Assuming it is a lot of this line on the board, or a problem of heat dissipation, I can pull it to the side of the board, or even he can do heat dissipation, I can put it directly into this water-cooled loop. This is a guest quote, in fact, we have made a phototype, so that he can make some confirmation.
