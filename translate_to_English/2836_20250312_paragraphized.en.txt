In the fourth quarter of 2024, the General Manager of Bank of Kaohsiung will be invited to give a speech to our guests. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs.

First of all, we would like to thank you for your continued interest in the Bank of Kaohsiung in the fourth quarter of 2024. Since the Bank made a cash value of $5 billion last March, the Bank has made significant growth in its various businesses. The net profit of this bank was $4.3 billion last year, which is about $1.3 billion from the previous year to the previous year, and this growth is about $64 million from the previous year.

In addition, our pre-tax surplus last year was 1.3 billion million, an increase of 1 billion million compared to the previous year, which grew by 9.61%. In addition, our net income after tax, about 96 million compared to the previous year, this growth also reached 11.1%. Second, we are listed in this book through other comprehensive profits, according to fair value measurement of the distributive benefit of this tool, last year we also reached 2.5500 million, this year compared to the previous year of the $1 trillion million, but also increased by about 76.26%, so we have the whole of this year, including net income, net profit before tax and net profit after tax, will come to this new high, I will have a more detailed report. Now let's take a look at a detailed number, please see our presentation.

The first page presents a performance of our entire operation last year, then we see that our pre-tax net profit is 1.3 billion million, which is 1.2 trillion million compared to the year before, net increase of 100 million1, which is a growth rate of 9. 13%. The net profit after the tax we have reached 9.61 billion, this year the net profit is net increase of 96 million, the growth rate of 11.1 The special report is that we see the last column of POPLIN, this OCI equity tool, this is the disposal benefit of the fair value measure of the other losses, this last year we reached 2.5 million, this year we have increased more than 1 billion million, the growth I just reported, 76%.

First of all, we see a state of our assets and total debt, which we see every quarter of every month, then you see this is our quarter of every month number, then you see this is our quarter of every quarter of every month number. First of all, we see the asset portion of the asset we have last quarter of last year, this total asset is up to 3.57 billion, compared to the same period of the previous year, we have a net increase of 438 billion, that is because it is an asset, so the main part of the net increase in our loans, we can see that we have to increase about 336 billion, there are some financial investments, and that part of that part is also part of this part, mainly this part.

First of all, we can see the equity, the equity is called net worth, we can see that at the end of last year, the number is to 250.26 billion, which is about 1.5 billion million, compared to the same period of the previous year, we are probably an increase of 64 billion, which is mainly due to several factors. The first one is that we made a cash value of 5 billion in March last year, that is because we are the premium issue of 10 pieces 7, so we will receive this 5.3 billion, this is the first factor. The second factor is that we have just reported earlier, we have the whole year after tax year, the net profit of 900 million, this is the second factor, so that this net value will be an increase.

Next is a more detailed analysis of the asset structure, then we see the largest part of this plot, or the orange part, that is, the advance of our discount funds, that is, the 2172 million, is not the part of our back deposit deposit, that is, we have to deduct that, the amount is about 455, about 2.6 billion, this is probably the main part. The second is our financial investment, which is, of course, some investments in Taiwan foreign currencies, and some assets as liquidity preparation. Well, let's look at the next page. Next is the analysis of our debt and equity structure, then we see the debt, which was last year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

For example, users may want each paragraph to correspond to a topic or topic rather than to a timestamp. Next, I need to determine how to segment. Usually, when the speaker is discussing the same topic, the sentence will appear continuously, and when the topic is converted, a new paragraph may be required. For example, when the original text mentions different topics such as bank liability, equity, profit and loss, each topic may need to be segmented separately.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, ensuring that the converted paragraphs do not disrupt the original sequence of time. Each timestamp corresponds to a sentence, so it is necessary to keep these timestamps in place and make sure that they are in the correct position in the paragraph. In addition, the user mentions "do not delete any sentences", so it is necessary to ensure that all the sentences are included without missing.

Finally, after the conversion, I will read through the whole paragraph verbatim to check if the user's requirements are met, to ensure that there are no omissions or errors, and the transition between paragraphs is natural and logical. </think> is 3256 million. We know that the bank's largest liability is our deposit, because the bank is an intermediary industry, our main capital is from this deposit, so this is the largest part.

We see the right is our equity, that is, the net value of this part, that is, the largest part of our share capital, this part is 183 billion, then I specifically mention this retention benefit, because this account retains a profit of about 50 billion, that is, the main component of the 50 billion, the first is the statutory debt, the statutory debt is actually the most important part, and the other part of the special surplus amount is the last year, because we can not distribute this cash dividends and stock dividends, a special surplus, because at the time we just reported this comprehensive benefit, such as fair value is a loss, so the profit at the time is to list this special surplus. We can see why at this 2Q in 2024 every year we feel that this curve chart is the highest point, because in the second quarter there is a lot of dividend distribution, including one of our long-term equity investments and the dividend distribution of listed companies will be concentrated in the second quarter, so we can see that this, whether it is after tax surplus will be the peak of this 2Q in the second quarter, this peak is likely to recover, which after the peak, it is likely that the relatively normal state has been restored.

The second curve is our net profit after tax, then we are the same as the previous one before tax is 3.4.8 billion, then the fourth quarter of our tax is to 2.0 billion, compared to the same period of the previous year 1.71 billion, there is also a net increase of 7600 million, probably. In addition, this is a surplus of $700 million, we can see that last year's fourth quarter of the same year compared to the previous year's previous year's same period of the same year is basically the same, but in fact, the structure is different, because in the first quarter of the last year we actually did this cash value, a great value, in fact, we have actually increased 40%, so after the tax, it looks like the surplus of the US stock, but in fact, it is a lot of money to make more money, because this is really large cash value, because it is very much more. Well, let's take a look at the next page, so it's good to see a situation in our earnings for each quarter. The graph of this presentation is divided into the first half and the second half, which is one of the relevant revenues for the entire year, including the source of the earnings and how it is distributed.

That is, we can see that Falun Gong in the three pie charts, we first see the green plot, above is a 2024 of our whole situation, the second part of the whole situation of the previous year, we see this green part of the whole situation, then we see this green part of the whole situation, we see the net income, net income? last year's total amount was 43 billion 850 million, that is, we only increased by 5 billion 2100 million, this growth has also increased, that is, this 5.64 million removal of this 38.21 million, the magnitude of our growth is 14. 76, nearly 15 percent, so how it was just mentioned earlier.

Our net income is mainly based on three pillars. The first largest or net interest income, followed by a net income of our handling fee, and then our financial operation. We first saw this blue plot of this part, our net profit, we can see it as a percentage of the total interest, accounting for the previous year, about 67 percent, compared to the previous year 66 percent, the gap is not large, the gap is not large.

This is the second part of our plan, we look at the second part of our fee, the net income of our fee, then you can see that we last year's net income is 900,2 million, that compared to the previous year's 70,2 million, we have increased about 1 billion, which is the main increase in what part of our fee, in fact, we are now the most important part of our fee income, the main two parts of our fee, or the first one of our wealth management, followed by some of the fees of the lending business. Of course, there are a small part of our fee, including foreign exchange exchange exchange exchange, there are some remittances, and some such fees, etc., the most important or the first two parts of the first two, one is the wealth management, the wealth management, the last year of our wealth management, the revenue, compared to the previous year, the previous year, that is probably more than the previous year, that is about 1, 1, 1, 1, 13%, that is 1, that is more of our revenue, that is 13%. Last year's operating expenses we can see that last year's operating expenses are about 300,400 million, compared to the previous year's 2.7,80 million, about 200,960 million, which is mainly to increase, of course, because just reported, the largest part, of course, the largest part of the operating expenses, is a staff salary.

In the past year, the net increase of this 200 million, mainly because we donated to the credit insurance fund, about the previous year, that is, we donated more than 113 years, which is about 86 million more than 112 years, in addition to our sales tax, because we have a large increase in the amount of deposit, that is, due to the income of tax, because the income of tax is also significant growth, so our sales tax portion, compared to the previous year, about 55 million. Then we have a cash increase in March last year, employee subscription, that is the amount of this, that is the actual price difference between the issue price, is to calculate an employee's salary, so this cost is probably also accounted for 29 million, so why we will increase more than the previous year, the main reason, 86 million, then 55 million, and that is the staff's increase the cost of the same amount of the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the year, we have paid back.

One of the 35 million, because we made a lot of money last year.

An increase in the amount to be paid. Must be listed as a fee. Of course, there are different types of distributions. This percentage is not the same. If it is 2nd of Article 72 of the Banking Act, this is a fee to be listed as a 1.5% deposit.

That's because last year's loans grew significantly. That's why we mentioned last year's reserve pending accounts. More than 5,9 million inside. Of these 3,5 million. That's because of the increase in our loans. And that's because of the increase.

This is a huge increase compared to the previous year. In the previous year, we increased the amount of this contribution.

But last year, we were about 3,5 billion. About 1,003 million more. This is the part to be accounted for.

This is the net profit of our tax revenue. We are 1.205 million compared to the previous year. We have increased this billion. This growth is probably 9. 61%. Let's take a look at it.

Next brief. Next is a state of an average booking of a business with a deposit. It is reported by the following.

We do have a deposit last year. It really has a very long progress. First of all, we see this. Green is an average booking of our deposits. We can see the quarter last year. Our number is up to 2 million.

2 thousand eight hundred and sixty-one billion. That is the same as the same year of the previous year 2 thousand eight hundred and eighty billion. We have increased 31.7 billion. So there is no verbal supplement in this table. If you see that we are all year round. That is, last year 113.

The average deposit of the year. Compared to 1,10012 years. Our deposit has probably increased by 31.5 billion. If we look only at the balance of a deposit in December 113.

We also increased the average balance of a 38.7 billion deposit. That is, if we see the peer-to-peer. That was at the end of December last year. Compared to the day on December 31, 2001.

That's why this deposit, no matter which average point of view, we've increased by 3 billion.

In addition, we see this red curve chart. It is a situation in which we have a growth in our loans. We see last year's fourth quarter. Our number is up to 2,182 billion. The same period of the previous year.

We have also added 31.42 billion. So you can see this number. Whether it is 31.76 billion deposit, or 31.42 billion we make our money. In fact, there are more than two numbers of growth. If you look at the single season.

The deposit grew by 15 percent. That said, it also came to nearly 19 percent. This growth was very impressive. It also complemented the report. If we see a number of our loans. We see one of the numbers.

An average balance for the year. That is, compared to 112 years last year. We also increased the average balance for the year. That is, if we see last December. Compared to the previous year.

The average balance has also increased by 348 million. That would be if you saw the end of December. That was at the end of December of the previous year. The amount also increased by 339 billion.

We've made a lot of adjustments to the structure of the content of the loan. That is, we prefer to use the money market rate to calculate the interest rate. That is to say, this part of the loan is relatively low-yield. We've also adjusted it to 48 billion. So if we put this in the numbers we just talked about, we'll look at the average of the month to month.

About the average balance of last December compared to the previous year. The estimated amount of money was increased by 396 million. This is also because of the cash increase. Let's have a bigger business momentum.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: [1856. 54-1857. 34] This is actually something that is Pla Humano Play. [1857. 34-1858. 20] Pla Humano Play. [1858. 20-1858. 34] Pla Humano Play. [1858. 54-1859. 82] 377 billion. [1859. 82-1862. 12] The foreign currency is less than 100 million.

[1862. 12-1865. 20] So this is the main increase in our last year's deposits. [1865. 20-1867. 50] Most of all. [1867. 50-1872. 88] It can be said that all increase in a single deposit in NT dollars. [1872. 88-1878. 00] After this, our share is more than we can see, and the proportion of a deposit in NT dollars is about 85%. [1878. 00-1880. 30] The foreign currency is about 15%. [1880. 30-1883. 88] Compared to the same period last year, the NT 83 and this nearly 17 adjustments were made.

[1883. 88-1886. 18] You can see very clearly from this chart, but the absolute number is increased a lot. [1886-1888. 74] This is a change in our one-year-old last year's fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of the previous year's deposit. [1888. 74-1891. 30] Next we take a look at the next page. [1891-1893. 60] We can first see that the left-hand loan we split into our principally debits and a municipal loan. [1893. 60-1894. 62-1886. 68] We can see that this loan is about 66% by the end of 2024.

[1896. 68-1898. 74] This is about 32% of our government loans. [1898. 74-1903. 58] This is about 2. 57% of our government loans. [1903. 58-1906. 14] This was zero when compared to the previous year. [1906. 14-1908. 92] We had a municipal loan since April last year. [1908. 92-1911. 70] That was zero at that time. [1911. 70-1914. 38] The structure shows that the previous year was 65.5 percent of a BNP loan. 46%.

[1914. 38-1917. 14] In that year, we could see that our entire increase in the contract increased by $2.8 billion and that part of the municipal loan also increased by $2.8 billion. [1917. 14-1920. 90] This is an object-oriented view. [1920. 90-1925. 64] Next, we can look at this picture on the right hand side of the coin, and we also have a coin-based view. [1925. 64-1928. 46] We can see that our loans are mainly or part of the NT dollar. [1928. 46-1929. 78] This is because the amount of foreign currency in our bank's view is very little change. [1929. 78-1934. 58] This means that it represents a significant change in the proportion of the entire loan.

[1934. 58-936. 62] In recent years, there has been a difference between 9% and 11%, which is the part of the foreign currency. [1936. 62-1938. 66] This is probably the range. [1938. 66-1943. 54] The portion of our Taiwan Dollar is relatively high, which we can see at the end of last year is probably 90%. [1943. 54-1946. 10] The sum of that is indeed a lot higher. [1946. 10-1948. 92] Is an increase of 342 million, which is the amount of 340 million at the end of last year's fourth quarter. [1948. 92-1950. 70] This is an increase of 342 million.

[1950. 70-1952. 50] Let's take a closer look at the next page. [1952. 50-1955. 58] The next line is a condition of our profit margin and net profit margin. [1955. 58-1958. 38] We can see that this blue curve chart above is our total profit margin. [1958. 38-1961. 98] The spread of our total deposit is about 1.65, and the 1.63 of the same period last year was about 2 points higher than that of the previous year. [1961. 98-1967. 10] If we see this part of the net profit margin margin, the average value of the net profit margin is called this MIP. [1967. 10-197. 96] That is the net profit margin we can see that our net profit margin margin was reached 0.995.

[1971. 96-1973. 24] That we have increased by 10 percentage points compared to the same period of the previous year. [1973. 24-1975. 80] This is a good thing, that the whole of our interest-earning assets have all gone up and down this spread. [1975. 80-1979. 94] It is also reflected in our net profit margin. [1979. 94-1982. 50] I will then report on the next page. [1982. 50-1988. 14] This is a situation we have seen first of all that red is a profit margin difference in our foreign currency, so you can see that this is a profit margin difference from 2012, and that in 2023, there is a 2. 5 all the way down to the fourth quarter of last year.

[1991. 20-1992. 74] This is mainly the U.S. after 3Q last year, he has a downward interest rate, about a total downward interest rate after 3Q, that is, 1%. [1992. 74-1996. 06] In fact, the downward interest rate is basically floating rate, so this will correspond to the U.S. interest rate, or other countries' interest rates correspond to our downward interest rate. [1996. 06-1997. 34] This is about 40 percentage points. [1997. 34-2004. 78] The negative part of our dollar we see is about 1.75 which we see at the end of 2020.

[2008. 36-2009. 64] But one of the good things about this financial industry is that we are on this average. [2009. 64-2016. 30] Let's go back and look at the next page. [2016. 30-2018. 10] This is the quality of our assets. [2018. 10-2020. 90] So you can see that the first blue curve of our two curves is our cover coverage. [2020. 90-2024. 74] This coverage we had last quarter of last year reached 514. 8 compared to the same period of the previous year, 481. 42 we have increased 33. 38 percentage points. [2024. 74-2027. 56] This is also in a good direction.

[2027. 56-201. 90] The red curve is our pre-set ratio. [2030. 90-2036. 02] Our pre-set ratio was 0. 23 in the 4th quarter of last year compared to 0. 25 at the end of the year, and we probably have also dropped about 0.02 percentage points. [2036. 02-038. 36] This is also a good way to go about it. [2038. 36-2041. 18] The additional report also added that if we really want to cancel something like this, we now have a balance of 25.75 billion if we need to cancel it at the end of last year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check the contents of the provided transcription to see if there are any obvious errors or formatting problems. For example, if the timestamp is correct, whether the sentence is coherent. Note that some sentences may have a wrong word because of speech recognition problems, such as "verste can't" or "verste can't", need to confirm that it is correct.

For example, when referring to "capital genitality" and "capital genital trilogy", it may belong to the same paragraph, and the next "credit equality" may start a new paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp and make sure that each sentence corresponds correctly to the timestamp.

In addition, it is important to note that some duplicated or redundant sentences such as "true" and "good" may belong to the same paragraph and need to be merged into a natural paragraph. At the same time, checking whether a sentence is wrongly separated, for example, "old" may need to be merged with the next sentence, "luminos tooling", to form a coherent sentence. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read through the entire paragraph script to ensure that no sentences are missing and the transition between paragraphs is natural. At the same time, make sure that all the timestamps and content are consistent with the original script, without adding or deleting any information.

We have the ancient luminos tooling, a carving of a man, a good one, a good one, and an increase.

He said, 'This is what you used to do; this is what you used to do; this is what you used to do; this is what you used to do; this is what you used to do.'

And the earth is full of dust, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it, and there is nothing like it.

A comparison of the capital tri greens. You can see from this graph. Last year. Last year. 3Q is not 3Q. Last year was the end of March. You can see that we are the capital tri greens.

It's up to the top. That's because we made cash at this point in time. So it made us either capitalist green, or class 1 capital ratio. Or common equity.

But it is also reported with you. Even though we made this 5 billion cash value last year. But this figure is proportional to the national average. In addition to the first type of capital there is a slight proportion. The national average is a little higher.

Whether it's our capital or our common equity interests, it's either on average or low compared to the industry, or it's low. This is the first quarter of last year. That's what happened at the end of March.

We are back. We see it at the end of last year. It was the end of last year. It was the capital clan green. You can see.

oscillate to 13.28. This is why it is falling. This is because it is reflected in the substantial growth in our business, because it is whether it is a loan or our financial investment.

Banks only do this risky asset. This capital clan green will fall. It will fall. So unless you don't do business. You can stop here at this peak. But as a business sinks.

This part is going to drop gradually. Although we have to say it again and again, reducing this risky asset. An increase in speed. For example, we do some risk checks. That is to say, take some guarantees.

Or send some more trust funds. Or ride a relatively high quality. That is, sex is better. Higher grade. This risk factor is less. But.

As long as there is a business. There is still a coefficient of risk. There will be a decrease in this analogy. As I have reported with you, even if we ride the government. The risk factor of the government is still 20%.

Unless you are a central government. For example, the city of Kaohsiung. Municipal loans. He also has a risk factor of 20%. This is a factor like this. Our first class capital is also the same.

That was 13.32 from this peak period. Now probably. At the end of last year, about 12.21. The proportion of ordinary equity. From that time 11. 01. By the end of last year, it was probably 10. 13.

But compared to last year. The same period of the previous year. We have seen that. This is still a lot more. The capital city's main rate is probably increased by a percentage. If this is the T21.

That is to say, the percentage of the first type of capital. It also increased by 1.27 percentage points. This common equity ratio also increased. It also increased by 1.66 percentage points. There is still a very long progress here.

Although there is a certain distance away from the lower limit of the law. But that is. Because this ratio is higher. The higher the ability for banks to take risks, the higher the ability for banks to take risks. So this appropriate increase this capital trirate. It is necessary.

Let's take a look at a page. OK. Next is our credit equality. That's the word of credit equality. This is the principle of credit equality.

It is done once a year. It is not three days or two. Unless there is a major accident in the bank. It is a year. Otherwise, this principle is probably once a year.

This Fee has given us this rating of credit equality over the past three years. Basically it is maintained. There is no change in the three years. We can see this part of international equality. This part is also maintained.
