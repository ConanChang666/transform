Here are the rescheduled paragraph transcripts: We are pleased to invite Taiwan Digital Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. to hold this year's first corporate briefing session.

First of all, on behalf of Mega Securities, we are very grateful to the Chairman and the team for their age. We also hope that today, through today's legal meeting, we will be able to understand more about the company's operations and future outlook. We also hope to have more interaction with the company.

First of all, I would like to introduce our management team. The first one we all know is our beautiful chairman, and today we are honored to invite him. Thank you to Chairman Liao. The second one is our vice chairman, Lin Vice Chairman, and the third one is our Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Operating Officer, Cheng. The two are very beautiful.

Our Vice President of Operations, Yangtze River. Finally, we are the Chief Financial Officer, and we are honored to be invited to the Chairman and to present our presentation today. Thank you to the Chairman. We still have good friends in Hong Kong. I haven't been out of the market for a long time.

Our chief financial officer was very attentive, and we had a briefing with our Mega Friends. I think that you should be able to raise your head to see the chief financial officer in Taichung. Today we are going to take a look at the stock of Tai Shuke. I don't know how many companies I'm talking to, but this one of our Taiwanese legends is not awake when he hits you. I don't know if everyone wakes up when you wake up.

If you have a lot of industries that have not been converted yet, I think you will be very sorry for the market in Taiwan. It is probably a good idea to count the days. We look at the performance of Tai Shue in this period, but it is still very robust and feasible.

Let's take a look at this 6464 code. The company has a future direction. Let's take a look at the company profile. After we got a lot of medals from the previous year, our new ship was officially listed last year.

Another one of the three swords and one of the other one is our hardware. Our broadband. We will wait for you to report on the long progress of broadband. After the new boat has made this listing, the stock code 6656 has recently acquired this company.

When we were young, we often used this great organic product. We also received a lot of awards after the acquisition. I didn't say much about that award. Maybe you'll see our Tai Shuke and a new boat in the media often wins. Then we bought Line TV's cash increase. Now we have the entire group holding this local OTT platform in Taiwan.

I don't talk about Netflix in my native country. I talk about this OTT platform in my native country of Line TV. We are the largest shareholder in Taiwan. We own 38.1% stake in Taiwan. He is the current shareholding in Taiwan's largest online platform for entertainment.

That's our current investment structure. Maybe the best friends are familiar with cable TV. Yellow is the one. That's why our hardware is in light blue. TSMC is the ratio of our broadband growth so fast. So let's introduce TSMC as well.

The new boat, which is a subsidiary of our company, will also be a demonstration. The new boat was also very active after the stock of 6656. Last year, his overall performance grew about twice as fast. We hope that he will soon be able to give us a baby.

Our broadband growth is relatively small in our industry. Let's take a look below. Our business is three swords. The left is our company's new boat group. The middle is our broadband into the telecom business. The cable range is from the central area to Chiayi and Tainan.

We are the largest company in this range. That's the part of the TV. That telecom, our broadband penetration rate, now everyone has reached 67.70 percent. In fact, it's a very high penetration rate. It's the same as Chunghwa Telecom's very competitive broadband base network locally.

The basic network is very important to know. Especially now there is a lot of competition under this geopolitics. So this broadband network lends itself to all households that have become a very important microvascular in Taiwan. Let's take a look at that industry, of course.

That's what we're looking forward to in the future, and we hope that Taiwan will be able to take us overseas. Those of you who see our TV recession is indeed there. There are about 0.9percent. Taiwan's cable photography is probably like that on the right.

That's why we've come down to the four major cable companies. That's why we've seen the part of our hardware in which we do a lot of the circuit services and broadband internet in the optical fiber network industry. That's why we know that this network in Taiwan is no longer enough to satisfy this kind of 4G that it's now 5G.

There are a lot of people who have contributed to Taiwan's number of users over the years. Of course, the government's line of business, etc. are all of our important services. Well, there is no Chunghwa Telecom today. That Mega should be there when they invite you, and it doesn't matter how much people communicate with each other.

There are a lot of areas outside of the country that we can now help them to implement the infrastructure in the industrial zone. You can see that there is not a very red industrial zone called the phalange after the phalange. There are a lot of sensors inside the phalange to connect to the drone. That is the important infrastructure of the phalange. That includes this intelligent monitoring is also an entrance monitoring now more and more and more timely.

That smart rod connects to 5G factories. These are important investments. That includes this 5G smart factory. We are now also investing in a company. We have also worked with Advantech.

The company is also quite beautiful. It is also expected to be listed in 2028. This is the scene of our telecommunications. We can work with many companies. Our media business is waiting for us. Our news reports.

This is our telecommunication business, including the original programs and commercials, shopping and satellite business, and the development of AI and digital development.

We don't have to see it. I'm talking about the number of winners today. Maybe you'll see it on TV. It's a very well-run media company. Our EBITDA. This should also be seen in the earnings report.

I don't have much to say about this. Everyone knows our margin. EBITDA's margin is still around 40. It's pretty good. Our cash flow. Free cash flow is around 1.3 billion every year.

Although we all see TV in recession. But it looks like an earnings report or in the top ten reasons. It is the process of the entire stock market is very volatile. You will see that we are stable. And the performance is good. We see this important financial ratio here.

Our gross profit margin is still above 50%. The net profit margin reached 20% last year. The growth rate was derived from the Meya Body Shop. The company's growth ratio is not small.

The debt is also our cash. The debt is also declining. The dividend is good. It is a stable telecommunications stock that we all see this year. We are the average after the announcement this year.

Our current yield is probably as high as 7.1%. Relatively stable. We don't have this floating sensation. But this is what we do in telecom stocks every year. Maintain this yield rate of more than 5%. It should be very long.

For more than 20 years. We've all been very good. So we're now looking at the dividends below. So we're seeing the proportion of a wide variety of products. Just in the photo on the right. You can see our video revenue.

From 80% we made the cake all the way up. The bigger we do, the bigger it is then diluted to the present time. It gives us only 53% of the risk factor. That's our revenue from the TV.

The other biggest growth comes from broadband. It is now up to 16% of us. The more we use the Internet, the more we use it. The income of the product is also the income of the product. The product income comes from our TV shopping.

The rest of the channel rental is stable. The original income is almost the same. But our video revenue has been placed in the remaining 53%. That's our ratio so far. Our group has four strategies.

The first is our broadband Internet of Things. We were involved in the construction of a lot of smart cities. Maybe you've seen the newspapers in the previous one. We've got smart cities like them. Gold medals are good to see. I'm so honored we're standing here.

Chunghwa Telecom is next to us. There is also our city leader award, and so on. It's hard to say what I'm good at. You can only tell us what we got. Let's take a look at it yourself.

It's part of the smart city. We can make a lot of contributions. It's also a smart service, including rural digital learning. This affects the performance of the company's ESG. We also do pretty well in the digital rural areas.

The NCC member of that teacher also holds our report. In the overseas teacher also received the award. Our content is the same. We will report on the cooperation with LINE TV. The expansion of our e-commerce.

And if they do not, they will not be able to do so; and if they do not, they will not be able to do so; and if they do not, they will not be able to do so; and if they do not, they will be able to do so; and if they do not, they will not be able to do so.

Data if you don't. There's no whole land now. If you live in the rural areas of this data. You're rural. How many people are using it now? Many are using it in English when it's big round model.

How we are here. In this big round model. We can develop our own fitness. We can stabilize the data black mirror. Using our AI technology to develop technology. This is our current four strategy down.

And the Lord said unto him, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for we are many: for the Lord thy God is with thee.

These big companies take us to a relatively small and medium-sized company. Together we went out to sea. We built a smart city in Bangkok. It is called Smart City in Taipei. There are many campuses built in this Smart City in Taipei. Then we brought Taiwan's high-tech technology to overseas.

He is the One who created the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who made the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who made the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who made the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who made the heavens and the earth, and He is the One who made the heavens and the earth.

Do more to follow the service. Come down. Well, that's our family's OTT service. OTT is a service that no one will ever have with me in the future. OTT and TV are really a very fast growing platform.

Here we are betting on Line TV. Why bet on Line TV? The first is the largest social network platform in Taiwan. It is also very large traffic.

It's a platform. It doesn't need to spend money to do journalism on its own. It's all the news rolling on it. It's that millions of people are reading every day.

This is why we use Line TV to provision Taiwan's largest entertainment platform. The TV after the recession, or more people watching the video, the longer time, where to run? Running on this many platforms to turn the video above. So here, we hope that all of the numbers on the left side of the number declines in the number of OTTs, so we have our own OTTs, and the number of OTTs dropped off on the left hand, we can pick it up, so we can fully invest in this smart video, and on Line TV.

Well, let's take a look at the production of the news, this content industry, we will tell you, it represents a company's brand and culture, this piece of new short video, there are a lot of stress, you may see us on other platforms in the near future, such as social media platform LINE TODAY, there will be a good show out.

We have a lot of government policies, we are now investing in smart manufacturing, smart manufacturing, we are working with the chairman of Advanhua Liuzheng, he will add this company, overseas its original location, we can add our AIoT, or we are in the sensors on the infrastructure, we can work with him, we can work with him in overseas development.

We also invest in this intelligent UAV park. I just said Amata this area, he is a Taiwanese student studying in Taiwan, but he is now a big real estate agent in Thailand, so he has a company called Amata, please go to Google search for it, then we also have a joint venture with him, with a number of big companies, I just remember these red sea research and development, we can build this smart park overseas, Taiwan books are not appropriate, each of us should be brave enough to go to the world, so we went to overseas.

The 5G campus, which I have just mentioned, is that our members can even get this award, holding this award, we in the rural areas make up its digital gap, Tainan the whole child, he can also get a lot of English, in his school, Chen Jin, can see many of the collections of the Palace, etc. These new 5G network innovation applications. So I think that Taiwan is a small place, as long as we can reach the network, we can provide better service, and we are also responsible.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the verbatim texts provided by a sentence to confirm the timestamp and content of each sentence. Then, I need to group these sentences according to logical and contextual relationships to form a coherent paragraph. For example, the beginning part mentions not to mention the names of others, followed by discussion about Arizona and Nokia, and then turn to corporate cooperation and 5G construction.

In the Q&A session, users' questions and answers need to be kept as they are, but they may need to be segmented according to the process of the conversation. For example, questions from the questioner should be segmented separately to maintain the clarity of the conversation. It is important to note that users specifically point out that they can't delete anything, so even if some sentences don't look consistent or repeatable, they must be retained. For example, "Don't say someone else's name" and "Arizona" and "What Nokia" may be in different contexts, but must be in place.

In addition, timestamps need to be retained, but users may want them to be presented in a more compact way, such as at the beginning of a paragraph or at the end of a paragraph. It is necessary to check whether users want timestamps to remain in each sentence or to merge them into a paragraph. According to the example, users may want timestamps to remain at the beginning of each sentence, but the line separators between paragraphs are separated. Finally, check whether the entire converted paragraphs are smooth, meet the requirements of the user, make sure that no sentences are missing, and structure is reasonable.

[1269. 46-1261. 46] Don't say the name of someone else. [1261. 46-1263. 46] Don't say one thing every day. [1263. 46-1263. 46] Arizona [1264. 46-1265. 46] Nothing Nokia. [1265. 46-1266. 46] We don't need to. [1266. 46-1268. 46] We have a very good vendor. [1268. 46-1270. 46] Can help us provision this 5G field.

[1270. 46-1273. 46] Can also do good security. [1273. 46-1275. 46] Do a good network transmission. [1275. 46-1280. 46] Is the resilience of the network we are talking about now plus the Rainbow supply chain. [1280. 46-1281. 46] This piece is what we can do. [1281. 46-1282. 46] Down. [1282. 46-1283. 46]

[1283. 46-1284. 46] We see this is what we are building. [1284. 46-1288. 46] See it. [1287. 46-1288. 46] Bargue is right. [1288. 46-1290. 46] opposite is Bargue. [1290. 46-1293. 46] We also see the identification of wisdom in Bargue.

[1293. 46-1295. 46] There is also a car coming to the city well, etc. [1295. 46-1299. 46] This is of course a very important case of overseas practice. [1299. 46-1300. 46] Go down. [1300. 46-1301. 46] Okay. [130. 46-1302. 46] This is a picture of what we have just come up with. [1302. 46-1303. 46] Let's take a look at it.

[1303. 46-1305. 46] We want to be right in this Taiwan. [1305. 46-1307. 46] We also want to. [1307. 46-1311. 46] This is the area of Amata in Bangkok. [1311. 46-1314. 46] The buildings in the smart city we build. [1314. 46-1316. 46] The government often shouts. [1316. 46-1317. 46] We want to come to the port.

[1317. 46-1319. 46] Gehhot Science Park. [1319. 46-1320. 46] Bangkok Branch. [1320. 46-1322. 46] What economic days do not come to an end. [1322. 46-1325. 46] The case of implementation is like this. [1325. 46-1327. 46] We really do it. [1327. 46-1328. 46] Not just talk.

[1328. 46-1329. 46] We really did it. [1329. 46-1330. 46] Go down. [1330. 46-1331. 46] Okay. [1331. 46-1332. 46] This is our ESG. [1332. 46-1333. 46] We all know that book. [1333. 46-1335. 46] It was carried out in Abel 97.

[1335. 46-1347. 46] is a lot of integration. [1337. 46-1340. 46] There are about twenty-three years of companies. [1340. 46-1342. 46] It is now about 27 years. [1342. 46-1344. 46] In the past 27 years, we have been listed for about ten years. [1344. 46-1347. 46] We have a lot of ESG in this society. [1347. 46-1340. 46] In fact, the company is very sustainable.

[1350. 46-1353. 46] That includes our commitment to inspection. [1353. 46-1355. 46] then responds to the matter of this ban. [1355. 46-1355. 46] Although Trump doesn't pay much attention now. [1357. 46-1359. 46] But we do it ourselves. [1359. 46-1361. 46] My friends often tell me that the transformation will die. [1361. 46-365. 46]

[1365. 46-1367. 46] It is difficult to die for the transformation of the company. [1367. 46-1369. 46] The turn of the head will not die. [1369. 46-1370. 46] Because you look at my head card out. [1370. 46-1372. 46] Trump's celebration ceremony was over. [1372. 46-1374. 46] He was not killed. [1374. 46] Just when we were in the chat.

[1376. 46-1388. 46] This egret of our trillions speaks to us. [1378. 46-1381. 46] Oyo, the celebration of that time is not afraid to die. [1381. 46-1383. 46] This is us. [1385. 46-1388. 46] We have long-term promotion of this ESG determination. [1388. 46-1390. 46] We hope to be in this process.

[1390. 46-139.2. 46] By a lot of force of the company. [1392. 46-1394. 46] Or we are involved in a lot of activities. [1394. 46-1397. 46] Can let us quickly transition. [1397. 46-1399. 46] Go down. [1399. 46-1400. 46] Good. [1400. 46-1401. 46] Not the greatest.

[1409. 46-1409. 46] I would like to wish you all a warm welcome. [1403. 46-1409. 46] I would like to thank the Chairman for the detailed explanation. [1409. 46-1413. 46] I think the company must be the light of Taiwan. [1413. 46-1414. 46] Then let us know more about the company's goals. [1415. 46-1417. 46] We also hope that we can make the company.

[1417. 46-1419. 46] There are some future plans for the operation. [1419. 46-1421. 46] Next is the time for QA. [1421. 46-1423. 46] Is there an investment advanced. [1423. 46-1425. 46] If yes. [1425. 46-1427. 46] Some questions can be raised. [1427. 46-1432. 46] Or send us some speaking notes directly to us.

[1432. 46-1433. 46] Yes. [1433. 46-1436. 46] We would like to ask for advanced investment or not. [1436. 46-1439. 46] There are some questions that can be raised. [1439. 46-1442. 46] Rare companies come from Taipei. [1442. 46-1443. 46] It is also a very long time to hold the entity. [1443. 46-1446. 46]

[1446. 46-1451. 46] It is not known where investment advanced can ask questions. [1451. 46-1451. 46] It is possible to invest advanced. [1453. 46-145. 46] It is good to have a dude to ask questions. [1456. 46-145. 46] Ask the Chairman. [1458. 46-146. 46] You just mentioned the overseas development. [1460. 46-1464. 46] We have not met with legal persons for a long time.

[1464. 46-1646. 46] You mentioned a lot of cases. [1466. 46-1647. 46] I don't know if this is because of fermentation. [1473. 46-1647. 46] I don't know what your future revenue planning will look like.

[1478. 46-149. 46] This is the first one. [1479. 46-1480. 46] To that one we said we did this piece. [1480. 46-148. 46] Of course, the original TV was lost. [1484. 46-148. 46] What will happen in the future. [1487. 46-149. 46] This question is called Nine TV. [1489. 46-1490. 46] I don't know about Nine TV.

[1490. 46-1492. 46] Because I didn't see this Nine TV. [1492. 46-1494. 46] I don't know the size of the year's revenue. [1494. 46-1496. 46] We have our position in the future. [1496. 46-1499. 46] We don't know what the future shares will be like anymore. [1499. 46-1501. 46] I don't know what the Nine TV can do. [1501. 46-1502. 46] Thank you.

[1502. 46-1503. 46] Thank you very much. [1503. 46-1506. 46] The overseas does have a lot of layout. [1506. 46-1508. 46] Those who see these cases. [1508. 46-1511. 46] To make a lot of profit in the short term. [1511. 46-1513. 46] I dare not say that. [1513. 46-1515. 46] But its future profit is stale.

[1515. 46-1519. 46] In particular, this government is promoting a lot of policies. [1519. 46-1520. 46] Inside the world. [1520. 46-1522. 46] You see the government's policies. [1522. 46-1524. 46] It is probably through the research of that think tank. [1524. 46-1525. 46] These policies. [1525. 46-1529. 46] It is a very important industry in the world.

[1529. 46-1531. 46] How our think tank can not win it. [1531. 46-1532. 46] So, there is a lot of government calling policies. [1534. 46-1535. 46] We are very important. [1535. 46-1536. 46] This overseas. [1536. 46-1539. 46] is a small company with us.

[1539. 46-1541. 46] Compare SMEs to overseas development. [1541. 46-1543. 46] I think this is for us. [1543. 46-1545. 46] Standing on the shoulders of a giant. [1545. 46-1546. 46] We can see even further. [1546. 46-1548. 46] We take this conservative strategy. [1548.

[1614. 46-1634. 46] We are now discussing a very important goal, which is Kumamoto. This goal is very important to us because we want to go out and expand our business. As long as the business goes out, we are able to expand our market and increase our revenue. [1634. 46-1647. 46] We are now facing a global era, but now even if we say that globalization is dead.

Of course, the strategy is different, but we think going out is a very important strategy, especially after the Trump tariffs, and we found that overseas is a very good market in Taiwan. [1647. 46-1662. 46] We are now trying to build a smart park in Bangkok, which is a very important point for us. Of course, we have other countries and we are willing to serve and try. [1662. 46-1670. 46] Second, we are going to talk about the recession rate of television.

This is a very good future development point, because we now have a penetration rate of seven percent, to eight percent, and then we are to provide more application, in this channel, so that it can grow its contribution, which is very important point. Therefore, we have a broadband growth confidence in this area, so most of us in the South Island, and in the area of Chiayi, Tainan, Taiwan, our recession rate may be a little bit less. [1684. 46-1733. 46] Our broadband growth rate, the complementary, is a backward one, about a third of the revenue, because the rural area is relatively low compared to the RPU contribution of this broadband.

[1756. 46-187. 46] We are now trying to focus on OTT, Line TV is probably Taiwan's native, Netflix don't talk, Disc don't talk, that is the world, that is very big, that we really do, but Line TV it is a local company in Taiwan, although it feels like it is the original, but this is all its accounts in Taiwan, it is a very important video and entertainment platform, we have a lot of tandem with it, but it takes time. [1787. 46-1905. 46] Because our colleagues want to go to digital, it needs to change a lot of brain and work habits, so Line TV this time, if you don't look at it, I can get a lot of it, because it's not high, but it can help jitter in our broadband, tied to the broadband, with the customer marketing, if you use the broadband, if you can give us a lot of it, it, it, we's a lot of it, it, it, we's, it, it's, it's a lot of it, we'll, we's, we've got a lot of what we'll, we've got a lot of it've got a lot of what we'll, we've got a lot of it, we've got a lot of it, we've got a lot of it, we've got a lot of it, we've got a lot of it, we'll be, we'll, we'll, we'll buy it, we'll be, we'll see it, we've got a lot of it, we've got a lot, we'll, we'll get a lot of it, we've got a lot, we'll get a lot of it, we'll see it, we'll, we'll, we'll see it, we'll, we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll be, we'll, we'll be, we'll, we'll

Your financial control can all come. I think this channel is important to us, so this is our competitive strategy, in which we are a small and beautiful company, to develop the most important strategy.
