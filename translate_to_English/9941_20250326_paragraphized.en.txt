Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. We welcome all the representatives of legal entities and the media to join us. In 2024, we will continue to strengthen the quality of our assets and respond to the government's compliance policy as the basis for our business operations.

In addition, we are more committed to developing Taiwan's corporate finance business and France's corporate finance, and deepening the development of energy and mobile services, with a diversified business, so that the future can continue to grow momentum. In 2024, the combined revenue of Taiwan's agricultural enterprises reached 41.71 billion yuan in the previous year, and the combined operating profit was $6.94 billion, down from 19.7 year-on-year. This is mainly due to the fact that Taiwan's capital costs are still high, China's economy has not recovered, and Southeast Asia and energy business is still in the early stages of investment, resulting in less than expected earnings performance. However, in the direction of dividend distribution, we have maintained 55% dividend yields in the past three years to ensure financial stability, support the growth of the financial level, as well as the interests of investors.

Looking ahead to 2025, we still have confidence in Taiwan's market, increasing the advantages of sales and commissions in Taiwan, and further enhancing the scale of assets and performance in Taiwan's market and domestic business personnel recruitment. In terms of overseas market layout, we are more focused on the development of Southeast Asia market, and are committed to improving profitability and scale. Our diversities in medical equipment in the Philippines have made good progress, and we have also launched a market outside of the capital circle of Manila in 2025. Malaysia officially opened in May last year, covering a variety of products such as medical equipment, commercial vehicles, etc., and expects that this year's business performance will exceed expectations. In terms of energy business, in addition to having 329 solar power plants, the device capacity has reached 100MW; in energy storage, the total storage capacity has been reached 110MW.

In addition, we have established a complete industrial chain and ecosystem for mobile services, with more than 8000 capacity fleets, and will continue to integrate mobile and vehicle services in the future. NineGo has been the third largest sedan platform in the market, and has introduced 7 services, users can enjoy convenient operation on Nine, such as taxis, sedans, airport transfers, car rental, shared car sharing, cost, car rental and charging. We will continue to optimize the service experience by 2025 to create diversified and efficient services for consumers. This year, we will continue to calculate and calculate institutions at a steady and resilient pace, and in 2025 we will continue to continue to carry forward and fulfill corporate social responsibility.

I want to invest in legal entities also understand that we have been sanctioned in Hangzhou's Yugro auto finance last year, because the total amount of its assets is about $8.5 billion, after the project, our change is flat. Similarly in the mainland, if the project is excluded, the total amount of assets in the same period last year has been slightly increased by 1%. The Taiwan part is that the balance of the assets of the dealership companies is a decline, but in the gas is a growth, the net said to be a slight decline of 1.2%. However, it can be seen that our proportion of China is only about one-tenth of a level.

The combined revenue of the year was $14,47 million, and the same as the same period last year was in a state of flatness. That was also a part of a structure of revenue, and the proportion of overseas continents was about 10%. As for a part of a set-up before the merger, a tax before the year ended at $6.93 trillion, which was a 17.7% reduction compared to the same period last year. I think that the amount of sales, including the balance of TAC itself and the company with the prepaid digital number, decreased by 17.7%, resulting in a significant decline in revenue. The EPS for the year ended at $8.8, which actually decreased by $2.19.

The ROA part is at 1.73%, the ROA part is at 1.73%, and the ROE part is at about 13%, and the ROE part is at about 13%. Then look at the 30 days of the development rate, then look at the 30 days of the development rate. The development rate of the Q4 part, the development rate of the Q4 part in Taiwan is about 1.6% of the range, but after that we can see that the absolute value of the Q4 part is about 4% of the decline in the Q3 part.

In addition to the TAC's own four-wheel passenger car, including new cars, used cars, and the other 100% invested prepaid digital to be responsible for the second round of motorcycle and goods business. The overall asset balance at the end of the year was 1169 billion, which decreased by about 4.9 billion compared to the quarter, and the decrease was about 4%. Although the balance of our total assets, including the intellectual convention and the quality of assets, is said to be these issues.

It looks like the balance of the asset is high. That balance is a decrease in the present. However, this decrease has been reduced for the third quarter in a row. The change in that year is about 241 billion. That decrease is about 17%. It is a much larger structure or a used car.

It is probably the amount of money in 761. That is the part of Taiwan. This is mainly in the emerging 100% investment this company is operating. The investment at the end of that year is in the amount of $760 billion. The asset balance at the end of that year is 886.5 billion.

The part of that season was an increase of about 2.3 billion. That increase was about 2.6%. That increase was an increase of about 1.8 billion that year. That increase was about 4%.

That may look like a situation that can maintain growth. That is part of corporate finance in mainland China. That is mainly Suzhou Yuli Leasing. It is also a company that is 100% invested by enterprises. That asset balance at the end of the year is about RMB6.1 billion. So I think we all know very well about a political and economic environment in mainland China.

In fact, it is relatively complex. There are some issues that include tariffs, etc. The company is also more concerned about. The company is also more concerned about the issue. But we can also prioritize the quality of assets in such an angle in operation.

This is the quality of our overall product. It is mentioned in Taiwan that we have this ratio about. It is maintained at about 1.6% of a range. It is then possible to see the expected amount of our Q4. The previous quarter's 34 billion was down to about 32.80 million. It is about a 3.8% range.

That's part of the continent. The Q4's expected ratio is 2.4. That's part 2.5 with Q3. There's a slight decline in a situation. That's part of the absolute number.

A decrease is probably a 4% increase. Take a look at this year's one. The profit-making performance of the parent company belongs to the parent company. It was around 5.1 billion. That was a decline of 18% compared to the same period last year. That's just what we mentioned.

It is mainly due to this factor. The EPS is $8.88. That is part of a performance in the ROA. Is 1. 73. That is what we can do.

One of our company's algorithms is to go directly to the net profit after tax. One of our entire assets. An average of one sum. That does not add to one of the fees for this interest. Because we mainly think it is.

Because interest is part of our business. So we didn't add this part. If it is based on the general standard of the company's ROA, it will be more than 3%.

With an increase in the overall average shareholder equity, so our ROE is down. About 13% of the size. Then look at us. That's last year's Q4 pair. The previous year's was the single Q.

The amount of our gross profit is about a sum of about 44.7 billion. Our gross profit margin is from 53.1 last year. In fact, it is down to about 44.44%.

That amount. This change reduces by 1.2 billion. A magnitude. A part of this change. Mainly in financing.

There are about 11 billion influences, so the main factor is probably the result of this. That is, we are in a subsidiary. This part of the cost. There are fees from other.

This cost. That also leads to our gross interest rate. This amount has been reduced by about two percentage points. That ratio. That amount from the classification is probably about $1.9 billion. That's why.

So it made us, too. This other business expense is the same as last year. There is a relatively large decrease. It decreased by about 5.7% compared to last year. A 517 amount is about 21%. The decrease is about 21%.

That can be seen. Regardless of the other rate, or the expected rate of loss. This is the percentage of our Q4 fee. All of this is a downward situation. That is another 23 years here.

The cost of our Q4. Our out-of-pocket expenses are relatively high. Mainly this objection to some tax in overseas, so make our out-of-pocket. Changes. There are also relatively large differences.

That said, the net profit after our tax is 8.3 billion. That's down about 100 million from the same period last year. A sum of 73 million. That's the part of the year to the year.

Gross margin is around 201 billion. Our overall gross profit margin is also from. Last year was about 54.7%. Our overall gross profit margin was also from. It was down to 48.6%. That part just had a part.

That's why the amount of gross profit is reduced. That's about 400 million. That's how Q4 compares to the previous quarter last year. The overall gross profit margin is probably down from 48% to 14%.

Overall, the gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%. Overall, the gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%. The reclassification of the gross profit margin was roughly two percentage points.

That part. That is, the comparison of Q4 last year compared to the previous quarter. The overall gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%. The overall gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%. The overall gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%. The overall gross profit margin was also reduced from 48% to 14%.

That's another part of the continent. That's the comparison of last year's Q4 compared to the previous quarter. That's the overall gross profit margin, about 14% from 48% to 14%. That's the overall gross profit margin, about 48% to 14%. That's the comparison of last year's Q4 compared to the previous quarter. That's the overall gross profit margin, about 14% from 48% to 14%.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the general structure of the content. It looks like it is divided into several sections: financial performance, ESG-related activities, corporate governance, future plans, and Q&A. Users may want to group these sections logically to form a coherent paragraph, not a sequential sequence. Next, I need to identify the timestamps for each sentence and sort them in chronological order.

It is important to note that some sentences may repeat or need to adjust the order to ensure smoothness. For example, repetition of the "mirror and dot column" may require a merger, but the user requests not to delete anything, so all duplicates must be retained. In addition, some sentences may be erroneous or repetitive, and the original "uh" needs to be retained. During the processing process, I will check every step of the way to make sure that nothing is missing.

Finally, I read through the finishing paragraphs to ensure logical coherence while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the original sentence. If there are uncertain places, such as the attribution of certain sentences, it may be necessary to determine the most appropriate paragraph position based on the context.

That's probably what we're looking forward to in Q3, but our Q4 is more seasonal than that. That includes less recycling, and our auction car will try to sell it out in Q4 as much as possible. Some of the out-of-the-box revenues on the Q3 are paid off here, so the 5105 amount is relatively large. The profit we've had in Q4 is about 8.3 billion in a single season, which is about 47% less than the same period last year.

There is also the signing of the MVV, which is shared by the Cultural Affairs Bureau, which continues to support us. There is also a part of the support car, which also provides support for the needs of the support car, and the amount of more than 30 million people. In addition, we may continue to strengthen the internal part of the corporate governance has strengthened this uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hu hu hu uh hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hu hu hu hu hu uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

In this case, I would like to briefly explain that with the hard and strong subsidiary i-electric and new heart, at present, there are 329 units of photoelectric power, at this time in the photoelectric power, the total electricity generation in the photoelectric power generation is expected to reach 8160 million times this year, the total amount of electricity sold should be good, should we still have some of the remaining construction in this year to complete, and then start with some of our electric power can be used to sell the power, the price will be better than we sell the electricity, so the whole amount should be expected to estimate this because at the beginning of the year, I think we should be in about 400 to 500 million, about 400 million to 500 million, about 500 million, which we can have a total of 329 units in Optoelectronics, 114M, a total of Optosphere of RAG, a cloud, one in Taipei, a Hualien, it must be on the watch the watch, and the watch the table.

In addition, we ask that we are a profit reduction of the main reason, this part is that we are outside the industry is the issue of the CB, the CB of this evaluation loss caused by the change of the industry is likely to reduce about 21 million this amount, that is, it is said that the portion of the interest income may be rectified when, just to mention that our next year's overall this standing should be the opportunity to show this growth, that the portion of the interest income may be rectified, just to mention that this year's overall this standing and is still the opportunity to present this growth, this part of the interest income may not be certain, but I think that the change in the amount should be narrowed down, and then there is a part of the import tariff reduction, the issue should be discussed in the media, but that the possible portion of tariff may be the brand may be the answer may be a bit more appropriate.

The following is a re-routing paragraph transcript:. That's what we assume is the impact of this performance because the total of this new car now is about 6 billion. But we have less than 7% of the total of 2000 billion of the outstanding balance. That said, if the total tariff is actually a downgrade, then the number of imported cars should actually increase.
