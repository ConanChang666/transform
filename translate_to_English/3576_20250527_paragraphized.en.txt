Thank you, everyone, everyone, everyone.

All of you, all of you, all of you, all of you.

All of you, all of you, all of you, all of you.

A. These cases start next year in the choice of products. Now everyone is a more panic situation. In Taiwan, we speak in the supply chain. Our double counter-tax is advantageous.

Because we only have a few sales tax. The average sales tax in Taiwan is about 7.9%. The URE is the lowest in Taiwan. Our sales tax is 1. 27%. So there is an advantage with double anti-tax rates. But it is still necessary to wait until the tariffs are clear.

The supply chain in the U.S. is still relatively clear. Also, it was passed in the U.S. last week. A bill from One Day Critical Fail. This affects ITC policies. It is expected that there will be a bill in the Senate in July.

If there is a correction or a say to pass or an objection. This is something we are constantly observing. That is to say, Evolving is an estimate. This year the U.S. has its own native module. It is probably 50.5 BW. But the U.S. native battery has only 2.3 BW.

The module that excludes molds such as thread solar. There will still be a battery capacity gap of 37 BW in the United States. So this part of the global supply chain is still being observed. That part of India. Bluer seems to have installed 39 BW this year.

India has seen a 19% increase over the previous year.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user's user-interrupted format to the paragraph type. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all the original sentences must be retained. This means that I need to check the verbatim fragments in a sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. Next, I will read the verbatim fragments provided and pay attention to the timestamps and content of each sentence.

For example, part of the maintenance and big data analysis of the URE should be merged into a paragraph, while the part of the EPC business strategy changes needs to be separated. During the process, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical process. For example, several sentences about AI-driven maintenance management should be linked, while the discussion of the storage part also needs to be integrated. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, without compromising the original sequence of time.

In addition, the user mentions "not deleting any sentences," so I have to make sure that each sentence is included in the final paragraph verb. This may require adding a link to some place or adjusting the punctuation symbol to make the paragraphs smoother, but it must not alter the original or delete the content. When dealing with technical terms and terminology such as "URE", "EPC", "AI", etc., to ensure consistency and proper use. At the same time, paying attention to the syntax of a sentence, it may be necessary to adjust the punctuation symbol (such as periods, commas) to separate different sentences, but cannot change the structure of the original sentences.

We are going to use AI to figure out what problems can occur in the flow and what happens in a preventative operation. That can improve the efficiency of solar power generation and reduce the cost of maintenance. We have also developed an energy-using carbon tracking system, which is mainly to help our customers monitor the efficiency of energy and make a carbon reduction effect. This is also an integrated solution for our customers.

We are not going to change our strategy. We will no longer make an investment in the case we develop with foreign companies or other joint ventures. This will improve the efficiency of the use of our funds, can diversify the risk of an asset, then our financial flexibility will be relatively high. What is more important is that we can bring in the development and the EPC income and profits.

This is why the government plans to achieve a 20MW energy storage capacity by 2030. However, we all know that Taiwan's manufacturers are very strong, and Taiwan's energy storage system is saturated in the energy storage market in a very short period of time.

The future of our meter thick storage energy is based on high-voltage users and high-voltage users as the target customers, we are estimated to assume 10% of the high-voltage users, the use of energy storage system to participate in the load power management and the power market, which is estimated to reach about 30 billion Taiwan's meter thick energy storage market output value will be about 30 billion, which will be a major source of revenue growth of URE.
