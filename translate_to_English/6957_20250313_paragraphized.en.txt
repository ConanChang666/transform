Hello everyone, thank you. Next we welcome overseas general manager, who is the CEO of our country in the United States. Hello everyone, I'm Susan. Next we have to ask for the chief financial officer. Hello everyone, I'm Luke.

Next time, we will give the expected managerial session to help us with today's legal briefing. Thank you. Let's get started. This time, let's make a simple description of the content. We will have about six parts of the briefing.

The first part is to follow it up. Today we are going to have all of it, and it doesn't come to fruition. Then we're going to look at last year's results.

Again, evaluate it because of the choice. The tariffs that you are most concerned about today, how much will the tariffs affect the company. And what is the strategy that the company is dealing with. The third thing is that if we are in geopolitics now, how do we keep an advantage.

How do we adjust our sales strategy? Go out of our own way. The fourth word is, we are currently developing products that are being shipped. The fifth is about to be developed. And then it is about to be shipped.

Finally, we are looking at this progress. We first look at the financial part. Our revenue in 2024. This is our revenue in 2024. At that time we mentioned that we had the opportunity to exceed 10 to 41 billion. Then the result was 4 billion.

The ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 4 to 6, and the ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 45 to 55. The ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 4 to 6. The ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 4 to 6. The ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 45 to 55. The ratio of Q3 to Q4 is 45 to 55.

Maori part. That's when we arrived at about 42% of the Maori low-label belt. High-label belt 44%. Then we settled 43. 4%. To be honest, my clay card was 44. 5. I think I should get 44. 5.

But later due to the loss of the whole store package. It may not be possible to get it back in balance in the fourth quarter. So the whole production capacity and order is reduced. It will make the entire gross profit budget a little lower. Then the ODM ratio will be more than 7.5%.

Then we settled about 72%. The Pash rate is not less than 80%. That is, the current Pash is a Pay13 stake. In QIN terms, our total revenue is 40.100 million. That's about 4% growth compared to 2023.

But unfortunately, that's what we do. Our operating expenses are over $1.9 billion. This is $1.9 billion. 99% of growth is around 4% growth. So we're in 2024. We're in 2023.

Our container is 3,200 pieces of money. So only the rate of shipping is this whole sea freight. Under the influence of the adjustment. That is to give us the proportion of the entire operating costs will be raised. So we have to be based on such a strategy. How we are important in layout 2025.

And if we do, we will be rewarded for it, and if we do, we will be punished for it, and if we do, we will be punished for it.

We were in 2025. We were in 2025. We wanted to add one atos to other global citizens. Any of our industrial accounts. We got starred. It was removed automatically.

The same goes for growth. It was in 1930. We also asked. Your income from global businesses. Your global market is who.

Your money. Your money is whom you are in the global market. Your money is whom you are. So when we come out in 2025, we can only inefficient. So we can just set up one.

It is a system of the original. This chart tells you what to report. Our revenues have a very special image. That is, it comes up after a period of braking and then goes up after a while. This is our basic pattern.

That is to say, the growth of each of our revenues. All of us have a representative customer to enter. So it will allow us to grow our entire revenues significantly. It takes three years for each customer to grow. So our revenues are based on growth. It will not constantly climb up.

I'm not afraid of that optimism. It's like you're going to rest after you're up and then you're going to go up. I think that's not the case. In this decade, we've grown the whole load by about 18%.

We see the entire product portfolio. Orange yellow is the so-called long-term price of ODM. It can be seen that from 2020, we have grown to around 2.7 billion by 2024.

That is, from the highest 1.4 billion to around 700 million. So last year, our ODM increased by 3.6. Unfortunately, it was eaten by the bed. Otherwise, our revenue could go a step further.

You can also ask why the revenue from this bed goes up. The main reason is the basic interest rate in the United States.

The U.S. spends a bed. It is a credit card to pay for a credit card. It pays the maximum interest during the credit card process. So you can see that. After 20 years of violent consumption. Slowing it shrinks very quickly after the violent rise.

After that, we'll adjust it first. Then we'll report to you. How do we deal with this? How can we pull it up?

The ODM portion is 67%. The bed is about 8%. The total capacity of the ODM is about 85%. Therefore, 85% of the gross profit of the company comes from the growth of the entire ODM.

This is because the price of the ODM has a good performance. Then look at the growth rate of the transfer load over the past four years. This is our total revenue.

The interest rate has been on the market for the past year, us, us, us.

But he spoke to Trump, at least, and he told you. I ship to the United States in March or a few months later, but I can't do tariffs. So he has a very clear point.

This is a clear sign that the customer wants to pay the difference, but at the time of Biden, we can't pay the difference. You can see clearly the customer's calculation, so this is a great loss.

"Today is the day when the wicked will be taken away, and the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire, and the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire, and the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire, and the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire.

So I'll be waiting for you to explain. That's right. The horsepower to see. Basically, we're constantly increasing. That's the future. The ODM's main driving force for growth.

That's the whole of last year. The universe's growth trend. It's basically YOY all the way up. It's higher than this green line. It represents our YOY. It's better than 2024 than 2026.

So you can see 12 months inside. There are 9 months to defeat 2023. But you may think. It looks like the company's revenue may be. The volatility is a bit larger.

They do not have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so, nor do they have the right to do so.

We've had a hard time following it. From last January's fall down 63%, we've flipped it back to the end of December. The refurbishment grew by 4%96. And then there's often a question. There's no pattern in every season.

Let us know if it's good or bad for the third quarter or the fourth quarter. It's a pity that we're talking about it. It's obvious that 2024 is. Basically, we're talking about it except for the second quarter.

It's a little different. It's basically a high season. It's not the same as it was in 2023. It's a low season. It's a slow season. It's a slow one after the first quarter of 2022 when there's a new high.

Basically, except for this season. It's basically the difference between the season highs and the quarter highs. So in general, we don't have a clear point in time for forgetting. But a more clear view is that it should be the probability of forgetting the third quarter versus the fourth quarter.

It's relatively high. It's a statement. That's what I'm all about. It's a report. It's a company with a few consumer markets, or a U.S. market. It's not the same industry.

That is to say, the market is relatively similar companies. Do some comparisons. To Yifeng to speak of. Of course, these are the most gorgeous. Tax advantage management is the highest. But you can see.

Our company is a company, basically or not. Relatively speaking, the performance is not too bad. That is, of course, at ROE shareholders' equity returns. We also see that we are the highest in ourselves.

That's the whole revenue load growth rate. Basically we are too. It's a good performance. It's lower than we are. Then we have the highest yield in stock yield. Of course, that's not fair.

Their industries are much larger than us. For example, it could be billions or two billions. Of course, we just report to everyone. We don't stop at it. We will continue to explore our markets.

If we say we are outside the United States. We have another possibility. Let's create our revenues. That's a look at the impact of the entire tariff on the company. Maybe someone for the first time. I'll explain it first.

That is to conclude, the company's price is basically the cost of the American industry. I will give you a once-in-a-lifetime look. That is, the cost of 100 pieces inside. There are 64 pieces of material.

2. 7 can work. 2. 9 can work. 2. 9. 3 can work. It is so-called advanced personnel and utility bills. Rent those supplies to 2. 9. 3. That's what the U.S. says.

Its material is 1. 6 times that of China. So the price is 60. The labor is 5 times that of China. I don't think that's too big a problem. That's the manufacturing cost we simply count. We multiply people by 5.

We don't have to pay for anything else. Basically, the cost of the United States must be higher than China. But we don't have to. We simply calculate. It's better to cut people down 5 times.

Its cost is 200, if the gross profit is 50%, my selling price is 200 pcs.

50% of gross profit. My selling price is the same as its cost. That's asking. Is it hard to sell as a U.S. company? It's impossible. It's taking at least 30% of gross profit.

Why 30%. Because the operating fee is at least 20%. Our company's operating fee is 22. I don't believe that the operating fee will be lower than our peers. So the operating fee is 20%. Net profit is 10%.

So it's at least 30% up. So, in other words. When tariffs rise to 87.5, basically we don't have any advantage. Now we have the advantage because we control the capacity of Taiwan and mainland China.

We created our rates, but the price is not the only consideration for the customer. Even so, the price is a bit of an advantage.

Let's take a look at how we deal with the entire tariff. We have several levels to look at. The first is the simplest one. The rest of the products are all add-on value. That's what we're talking about in the branch pack and the branch pack.

Or solve the pain point of the customer. Automated business system. Help the customer to reduce his cost. This is what our housing has been doing.

Another word. Make a manufacturing diversion. That is, part of the process is done in mainland China. Part of the process is done in Taiwan. Let the whole cost come to an end. Guests can go down.

This is what I'm going to show you. And then, that's what we mean. We reduce costs. We raise prices with suppliers. We raise costs.

At the same time, we exchange rates for some of our customers. And here in our continents. We have added a full process. We can adjust the cost to go down again. We can go down again.

The last word is, the customer is not really concerned at all. The price of our so-called price, why we sell the goods, he sells the service.

He sold the price.

The following is a re-routing paragraph type transcript:. What we sell is the price, basically the seller. Their 70% cost is from the price, sorry. 70% comes from the cost of translation, the other 10% comes from the labor, the other 10% is from the rental of the venue, the water and electricity those that do not have. So basically, the price is they are very much a small segment of the cost.

So the customer has a strong pricing right. Of course, when you wait to see this news, woomai is because he wants to rise, woomai wants to rise, he wants to reduce the price, is the import cost of commodity storage goods. So what he does, must be for large, if you have a company, you want to do what you want to do, you want to do, so commodity costs, you will find a lot to fall, you will not find that small bratina thing to fall, that does not make sense, it does not save your cost. So let's take a look at how much this 55% of the impact on the customer?

This is the reason why we do not want to sell our products to the Chinese market. Therefore, we will lock the domestic market, we will lock the domestic market, we will lock the domestic market, and we will lock the China market with the Chinese market. If we do not want to sell our products to the Chinese market, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market. Therefore, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market, we will not sell our products to the Chinese market, and we will not sell our products to the Chinese market.

In the end, I heard the President of the United States of America receiving the award, and I heard the end of 90 minutes. In this 90 minutes, I only found a very important thing, I want to bring this one to everyone's hope, I want to make money, I started making money, product design, I've been building the whole store in the United States, and we're making money now. So here we can also save everyone's money, that's what we're doing here, because I'm Taiwanese, I've been in the United States for 40 years, so when I'm in Taiwan, it's called the Galaxy, for a while, we're going to move to mainland China, now, I'm happy, I'm going to go back to Taiwan, to make these things like this time, I'm going to develop, OK, we've been here, we've got to the next year, OK, we'll show you, OK, we're here, we'll develop, OK, we're here, OK, we're here, OK, we've, we've, we've, we'll develop, OK, OK, we've, OK, we've, we're, we're, OK, we're here, OK, we're here, OK, we're here, OK, OK, OK, OK, we're here, we're, OK, we'll develop, OK, OK, we're, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're here, OK, OK, OK, we're, we're here, OK, we're here, OK, we're, we're here, we're, OK, we'll, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, OK, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, OK, we're, we're, OK, we've, we're, OK, we'll

So, this is what we started from the product development, until the installation design in the store, OK, the second, we see this one, this is called Pricing Tag, that is, when he went to every place, he used this to see how much money, print out, re-, so he went to every store, we have a total of six Pricing Tag in the way, so, we went to last year, that is, we started last month, we have about a year, there are 1720 stores, we all have this Pricing Tag, so, it's OK, it's very simple, but I like our design, it's here, we're here, we'll do it, OK, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it, we'll do it. This is Coca-Cola, we are designers, with Coca-Cola, their designers, design a lot, so very simple Fiction, show them Coca-Cola new products, water, OK Coke, OK, so now he is in, Coca-Cola has been placed in CBS, Family Dollar, OK, Dollar Tree, this family Dollar, in the United States there are three thousand stores, if every store, now we are now, we are usually two to three, simple design, but this includes his advertising, we did, Trekker, now look at this, it's a pity.

Trekker: OK, at this time of COVID, we have installed 300 stores for him. OK, this Counter, this Counter, what will we do next? We'll do it again, we'll do it again. OK, help him install his cash, OK, his Cash, OK, how to put it? So here, all the other side of Carharttt, OK, sell clothes, we made him an advertising design, so we're doing some things for the designer. OK, we have a strong design department, we've started from the beginning, we've been with the customer in generating this connection, and then from the design, until the factory's production, to the in-store installation, where we'll make money.

OK, this one is the one I feel most proud of, this family farm and home, OK, what we made for him, what we made for him, what we did for him, OK, they told us, because of our design, all because we brought him a lot of customers, so this is one of our strongest projects, we have a good design department, we have to do these services for our customers.

If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start. If you are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start, we are looking for a place to start.

Ace, Ace Hardware, this is all DIY, so this time we were at Ace Hardware, he invited us into the inside, in his Ace Hardware Show to attend the exhibition, OK, we helped him do Countertop, OK.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained.

First of all, there are multiple timestamps and corresponding sentences in verbatim scripts. The user wants to group these sentences logically to form a coherent paragraph, but each sentence has to keep the same. I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or the same topic, and then merge them into paragraphs. For example, the section about Home Depot may have multiple related sentences that should be put together.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that each paragraph is in the correct time range. For example, sentences starting with [1972. 92-1974. 92] may belong to the same paragraph until the next topic begins. I then deal with each sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the user mentions "We have done Countertop in Show", and then "Then", which may be a transition sentence that needs to be retained. At the same time, pay attention to the interval between timestamps, if the time interval between the two sentences is shorter, it may belong to the same paragraph.

In addition, specific items such as "CVS Pharmacy" and "Towel Set" mentioned by the user also need to be properly classified. There is a need to ensure that each item related sentences are grouped correctly to form a coherent paragraph. For example, the CVS section may involve design demonstrations and product placements, which should be put together. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as discrepancies between timestamps, or logical relationships between sentences are unclear.

For example, the user mentions "OK" multiple times, which may be a marker of the end of a sentence, but needs to be judged according to the context. Finally, after completing the preliminary segmentation, I read the entire finishing text to check whether the textualization is consistent with the user's requirements: without deleting anything, all sentences are logically grouped, timestamped correctly, and maintain the integrity of the original text. At the same time, make sure that no additional content is added or modified to the original sentence, and it is organized entirely according to the user's textual textualization. In summary, the process requires careful timestamp analysis, logically grouping judgment, and strict text retention to ensure that the final output of the paragraph typed text is consistent with the user's requirements, and is readable.

[1974. 92-1975. 92] Then. [1975. 92-1976. 92] We also do this. [1976. 92-1978. 92] Because of the system of sprinkler. [1978. 92-1980. 92] is BI designed. [1980. 92-1981. 92] OK [1981. 92-1982. 92] is BI designed. [1982. 92-1984. 92] So we have this permission for this design.

Where did we go from here? where did we go from there? where did we go from there? where did we go from there? where did we go from there? where did we go from there? where did we go from there? where did we go from there?

So this is a very large amount, this year, we may do with him, tens of millions of yuan, there should be no problem.

He gave us four million RMB for the first time. The two thousand RMB. The two thousand RMB. The two thousand RMB. The first time he spoke to us. How much is the amount of water he absorbs.

That's why it's why it's that way for the electric car.

The market will be so big. Because China's electric vehicles are the biggest market. It is also very difficult to enter this supply chain because it is an oxygen.

We have been using them for a few months now, and they have been using them for a while, and they have been using them for a long time, so we have been using them for a while.

This company Oxygen it throws out something out of the year. It costs $30 billion. Not only that, there are many things that we do, but now we do it first.

There are a total of eight products to do so, so we have always been doing this, because first, the United States tariff problem is not affected, of course.

"We have been doing this for years," he said, "and we have been doing this for years.

This is because the first, because the second, there is no question of profit, because he is responsible, we do not have to be affected by the cost of Feng Shui.

He is also responsible for the whole family. That's why the company came to market after. We've always reported with you before. We have a lot of questions. We have a plan to go. There's just something we can't talk about.

And we have a promise that we will never be able to meet again, and that we will never be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again, nor will we be able to meet again.

We have a contract, and then we have a family. We have a contract with an economic supplier. So let's report with you today. Sometimes the market has been telling the same thing. A thousand years of results fluctuate.

I think it is. I often report it to you. A thousand is different from another company. My company is a thousand a day. There is a water line in the production line every month. We are not.

Because we rely on design. We can't go with others. If we do the same thing as others, I think a lot of people will not know. A thousand companies may be one or two or three.

"I do not know," he said, "that we have a thousand things to do, and we have a thousand things to do, and we have a thousand things to say to you.

Why is it so good for you? They don't want to know. I've been talking about it. Our company's gross profit has always been this high gross profit. Don't look at this gross profit can also be high. It's hard to do.

It's not a good thing to do. They end up looking for someone else to do it. They also go to Qingdao. Find out which one to do it, but the quality of each one is not necessarily. Sometimes this is the case.

It's a layer. It's not a layer. It's not. It's not. After it's done, it's looking a little bit smaller. Then this engine is like that. It's done all the time. The engine it's done is always inside the warehouse.

So its full traction. mobility. Precision is enough. Otherwise you plug it in. It may stack up to five layers. Stack up to six layers stack up to eight layers.

The time has come for a great fall, so it's a very good design, so I think it's what I've been looking for.

There are a lot of new things, so I believe, all investors to some comparison, to a lot of confidence.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

I don't say it. It's like a company that makes a lot of money. Then put it in the bag. It doesn't work, but I don't think.

Investors want to invest in us. Encourage us. Or else you can invest in us. Look at the stock. Of course, there are people who want to make money on the stock.

You're going to have to buy stocks now. People can't make money on this stock. How the stock money goes. We're going to stick to the principle of listing. We're foreseeing that we'll get something new every year.

We will also create a lot of new niches. That's what we believe is our entire business this year. Our business goals will be the same as last year.

That's what we do, because our company is very different from others. It's like a product. You've always been an estimate. That's what we do.

So we are going to keep up with the progress of the report, and it will be done, so I believe that the future, no matter what the next year will be, there will be a good development.

We have a lot of things to do, and we continue to improve. It's like the entire sustainability of ESG. We're like this year.

This is also the whole. China's electric power is also on the line. So we will continue to push forward. What to do after listing. That's the whole goal for investors. We say we'll do it.

Thank you all for your support.
