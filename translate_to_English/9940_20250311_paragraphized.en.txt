Investors are welcome to participate in the online investor briefing session of Xinyi House in the fourth quarter of 113. Today's meeting will be explained by CFO Chen Zhi-Hsiang and Project Manager Chen Jing-Hsien. During the meeting, you can use the blanks below the slides to enter your questions, and we will write you a reply after the briefing.

In the past year, it was 29%, business interest is 1.7 billion million yuan, business experience rate is 14% yuan, revenue outside the industry is 400 billion yuan, income tax fee is 400 million yuan, experience is 1.8 billion yuan, experience is 14%, that belongs to the company's experience, that is, we are concerned about the EPS calculation of the part of the experience is 1.7 billion yuan, the last EPS is 2.42 yuan, that look at the right side of the 2023 figure, as in the previous quarter, sales income is the part of the income of the house, is about 25 trillion yuan, that is the first time in the year of 2023, there is a fixed amount of $900 million of sales revenue, and then the whole sales situation in the mainland part of this part of sales is also in 2024, so the whole sales revenue is not much is worth more than that is worth more than a lot more than a new revenue. In addition to this, we have invested in some of the invested companies that are using other comprehensive profits to measure the value of the supply value of a equity instrument, the value of the supply price has increased, so this place has increased 67 million, and the change in the amount is the following place is the exchange difference of foreign operating institutions financial statements, this is the illusion of the adjustment and conversion adjustment of the number of gains, compared to the negative of the year 2023, the number of more than one billion, the number is more than one million, that is mainly comes from the US dollar and the currency of these RMB, so there is a significant increase in the exchange value of the next year. That to the 9th part of the investment friends see in the merger balance sheet, the cash and cash listed here about 8 billion more money, the main reason we have to report to you before we made some investment, including the purchase of U.S. bonds investment, the U.S. bonds now about 5 percent of the interest rate, to do such an investment plan, and the other is that there are some changes in the flow of other financial assets, the main 40 billion other financial assets, most of the flow of only a fixed order or more than three months of that data, then the detailed numbers please refer to the information above, about 40 billion is mainly from here, the relatively small two or three billion dollars of the amount of money in the pre-sale house, there are some changes, but not much, the main is reflected in the work in the work of some of the home products, the engineering put into these.

There are, of course, some parts of it that are sold. But the amount is not very large. The other part that is below is. Some of the investment real estate. With that right of use. There are real estate with the right of use.

A change in this part. That's the main thing. The report with the investor was before us. It was purchased last year. The land of the Northkan Farm.

So there will be an increase in the amount of around 520 million Taiwan dollars. That part of the tenth page is short-term borrowing. The portion of debt. That short-term borrowing is long-term borrowing that expires within one year. With long-term borrowing, this part.

The same is the report with investors. You can look at it at the same time. It's probably a growth amount. It's probably more than 200 million net growth.

It's about two billion more. And that's what other payments are. The main thing is to reflect the payable. Payable. A change in fees such as the Civil Bonus. That's in 2023.

The level of time is relatively high. It is mainly the amount of money paid at that time more than the amount paid at that time. After the payment is over, the amount is falling again. That is the next word.

Eleventh place. Please see this change in shareholders' equity. That is to say, in addition to the statutory period of work.

That's because last year's shareholders' meeting. We made some additions to the list we passed. That's an increase of 200 million unallocated profits. That's mainly due to allocation. Last year's cash was encouraged after. This year's profit again.

The difference between the two is probably the amount of about 200 million dollars. That's just what we're talking about. This is where the other rights come in. The cumulative conversion adjustment is the difference here.

From the end of 2023, 1.3 billion. The reduction is 6 billion 1.5 billion. The increase is nearly 7 billion. So this place is a place where you can desire to do some rotation. Let's do some rotations again.

Let's do it again. The amount of surplus that can be allocated. That's the whole talk. The portion of equity. At the end of last year. The total amount of equity at the end of 2024 is.

The total amount of the total assets is $324 billion. Then the next part of the plan industry is. The whole cash flow.

A case in which a cash flow statement is placed. That was at the beginning. $500,000. This part of the business activity. Can be seen. Whether it was 2023 or 2024.

It's a net cash flow. One in 2023. 323.3 billion or so. By 2024 2.1 billion. That's it. The change is mainly.

2023. Because there is a relationship to exchange. So he. The amount of net cash flow. Because of the increase in the relationship, so it is more obvious.

That's what happened in 2024. In fact, it's also a very good performance. That's the net cash flow into it. The amount of about 2.1 million dollars.

The one who buys U.S. dollar bonds. Or investment. North Korea Farm, etc. of these. Of course there are some investments. Some of the invested companies in equity law.

The main reason for that other investment activity is that it has increased with Iran. It has just borrowed more than 200 million dollars. That is to pay. The principal of the rent. And last year's payment.

Allotment of cash encourages. So the entire investment activity. Net cash flow of the investment activity is about 1.61.5 billion. The amount at the end of that period is requested in March.

You can see that it is in development. Real estate. Currently speaking is add-on and add-on. One in Banqiao is in a new town. That's probably what they add to the numbers. This part of the project is ongoing in demonstrations.

In the work. The other land in the southern area of Kaohsiung is. There is little movement. Then there is. The part of the water family has reduced the amount of about 280 million dollars.

We also mentioned that the price of iron in the stock is on time. In this place about 1,66 million. The total amount of the stock is 18,77 million. The other part of the 15 page is.

An income statement for an individual of a new home. Just look at the new home itself. So I can see briefly what it says. The revenue portion of the business. The new home increased by 8%. From $105 million in 2023.

Increased to 136 million yuan. Increased to 803 million yuan. That can see the portion of gross profit margin. In fact, there is a relatively significant improvement. About 3 percentage points. From 26% to 29%.

The profit of that business was $19,002,5 million. It also increased by $2,5 million compared to 2023. The business brokerage rate was increased by 1%. It reached 17%. The revenue and expenditure of that business increased after that. So it just mentioned that the entire broker was $17,88,4 million.

That's 16%, that's 19 pages, that's 19 pages.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription of the re-routing after the re-routing of the business activities, because in 2024, the words are still about 2 billion, and then in 2023, the words are 1.9 billion, not like the 30 billion you just saw. Mainly the home and the one, the portion of the home's money is not included in the individual's new money flow, so this is a brief introduction, the 20 page of the story is about the situation of the tourism business. At present, the words continue to do some work, we have finished last year, and then some of the floor has begun to emerge, so that some of the first part of the first floor can be clearly blocked, you can see some buildings, so on the other side of the interior, we continue to optimize, is to make the future atmosphere with the whole feeling of the customer a better experience.

In the first half of 2025, the outlook of the Taiwan housing market, then we asked the manager to explain, thank you. Well, the first half of 2025 housing market, some outlook, the current environment to talk about mortgage funds, although it is still under the open air of the central bank, the overall investment cooling but self-use, but look at the recent condition of a mortgage has some improvement, although it is relatively tighter, but now the public in the time to apply for a mortgage, it can be more clear how long after the bank has been built, this part of the relatively clear improvement.

When the investment friend asked if the expected time to complete the transaction, then we expected that it would be about 117 years, about the end of the end of the year will be about the end of the year will be completed, and then the imported may fall into a situation like 117 years, then the current progress of the project is still similar to what we expected, so this progress on the home screen is almost as we expected, so the progress of this progress on the home screen is probably as we expected. That investment friend asked if the average gross profit rate of 2023, 2024 is 27% and 30%, then the expected income of 2025, that the expected profit and gross profit outlook, as we just said, we probably know that the lower wave of credit control in the last September or so far, one of the volume of real estate agent is very large, so in this part of people also see that the whole announcement in February is not ideal, so we expect that there will be a bright color, that the whole speaking of the gross profit, and we do not what we do not what we do what we do.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section involves real estate market analysis, corporate strategy adjustments, financial data explanations, and the outlook for the future. Next, I need to identify the timestamps of each sentence and group them according to the logical relationship. For example, a discussion about the loss of a sentence in 2025 could be a paragraph, followed by an analysis of the housing situation, then a discussion of mortgage interest rates and direct-sale strategies, and finally an explanation of financial data.

At the same time, some sentences may belong to different themes and need to be handled separately, such as mortgage interest rates and discussion of direct-sale stores. During the processing process, I will ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order and logically coherent. For example, on the part of the housing market, from the overall situation to the comparison of second-hand and first-hand homes, to the strategies of different cities, and finally, the expectations within the company, these should form a natural paragraph.

In addition, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any one sentence", so it is necessary to check if there are omissions or errors. For example, the "is a joke" of timestamp [1670. 64-1671. 64] may be an error or a written error, but according to the user's request, the original sentence must be kept. Similarly, timestamp [2010. 64-2012. 64] to [2012. 64-2016. 64] There is a time to jump between [2010. 64-2012] and [2012. 64-2016. 64], and the user does not indicate the problem, so keep it as it is.

In the future, it may be necessary to look at the situation of the housing market and the market a direction, that is, the price of a housing situation to see if it needs to be mentioned, this part we will continue to do, and that will do some further evaluation. However, it is our current talk, we expect that in the internal or in the case of this case, we can do a sale again this year, is a joke, the 180 sets of leftover jokes, and so on.

There is no such thing as a short-term mortgage interest rate, and we will still see that there is no future interest rate, which seems to be a condition of interest rate, so there is a possibility that the situation of interest rate will be maintained here for a while, that the situation of a whole mortgage or the bank's funds is slightly less so that there is no such thing as a situation. Now it should be seen that there is a slight respite space. However, in the next two years, this volume is still very large, so we will look at whether the performance of a mortgage on the market can be maintained slowly to stabilize a performance.

The above-mentioned investment friends asked if the number of direct sales outlets has been declining in recent years, is in the strategy of the group strategy or market factors. That with the investment friends report that we did in the previous years when that electricity has reached a relatively high level, then now reduced to 465 stores. That also with the investment friends reported that we are too weak to this part of the story is the main consideration, so some of the branches if in location or overall how many of our so-called managers, is to find a qualified store manager on this matter, so we have to do a compound and make adjustments in this place.

So basically I just answered another question, in fact, I'm more likely to suggest that the business rate will be better, in fact, not to say that the adjustment of the change in the question, but to say that the cost of the whole business cost, that is, the labor cost, that the curtain, the part of the business cost here. That's the whole company to say we are not the same as doing the manufacturing of such an inventory relationship, so some of the manufacturing products are put to that small cost. So the concept of the idea is to look at the business interest will be more clearly able to understand the company's business situation. I just answered some of the investment friends mentioned, that the adjustment above a strategy to speed up the speed, is probably not going to do much flow in this part.

In addition, it is because the business part of the words has been lowered, and then it is not to be developed as the main model to expand the hands. At present, the words should be relatively without such a plan, the development part of the case we can see in the past ten years we do not have a lot of cases, so the treatment should be to have a stable promotion is more appropriate, so it is not to say to speed up what is the situation, and the opposite is that we are more inclined to such...

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-word transcription: This is a model developed by synthesis, so it is likely to be done in a relatively light way. So, if it is relatively speaking, it will look a little more energy, and you can do this part of the synthesis. Then there is no need to put the whole business focus, to the development of the main to expand the revenue. The doctor's friend mentioned that, the meat heard the 2024 EPS, called the 2023 increase, then the trouble doctor's friend wrote it again, because I did not see the following text. That is basically, I should just say that last year's 2024 EPS is 2.42 yuan, which is probably added to 2.39 in 2023.

In the past two years, the Japanese market will not expand our business location, and we are now looking at the boom in Japan to invest, and it does not seem to decrease the situation, so we still look optimistic, so we call this kind of service of the Taiwan-Japan chain. It is also another point because of Japan, regardless of Tokyo or Osaka, there are related topics, especially like Osaka before mentioned, it has a international trade fair, there are some games, a similar game, a future game, so it seems to be more timely. The whole price part of the price is also out of the past, has not been too moving, recently a price situation is not good, so we expect, we will increase some business class in Osaka, because previously mentioned, we will have to local service, there will be a lot of this, but we will do not want to do a lot of it.

If you are looking for a place to buy a house, you may be looking for a place to buy a house, but if you are looking for a place to buy a house, you may be looking for a place to buy a house. If you are looking for a place to buy a house, you may be looking for a place to buy a house, but if you are looking for a place to buy a house to buy a house, you may be looking for a place to buy a house to buy a house. If you are looking for a place to buy a house to buy a house, you may be looking for a place to buy a house, but if you are looking for a place to buy a house to buy a house, you may want to buy a house to buy a house. In the future, if there is a need for a better development plan, with that there is a better amount of energy, we will do a development here again, after all, it is a little irritating to oppose that, the current ability to look at the investment friends to ask this year, is the region's trading volume is followed by the status of customers, then we are observing the overall, a visitor, is generally called, after the Lunar New Year is very clear, back to about the fourth quarter of last year, a relatively normal level, but we observe that if the actual two months, or February a performance, the actual stable market, but in the North of a market transaction, is presented a relatively stable, is the same as last year, the recession is relatively small, the recession is more obvious, the past is a relatively rapid rise in some areas, then the performance of the market, such comparison, such as the northern relatively stable, the price expression, or for the price zone, or for the price is hesitant, there will be a kind of a kind of the year, as we do not make a prediction.

After all, the city now has entered into a self-use road. Relatively biased. The whole period of the board. So for the expected price and volume. We did not make a more specific direction in this direction. Investment friends asked about the Japanese real estate.

There is an interest rate increase. Therefore, the Japanese yen has a certain appreciation, but it still has. The amplitude of the appreciation is limited.

And we see that the people of the land, who are of the tribe of Levi, are of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi, and of the tribe of Levi.

This is for Taiwan Nihon Electric. Our internal view is in fact a relatively optimistic view. The other part of the story is for Japan, because it actually has very little trading volume. One of Tokyo's so big that only two or three thousand minus one year.

So we're talking about the obvious goals. It's probably going to follow up. It's probably going to be out of service. Outside of the Japanese, we've also set up a Japanese team like this.

Because of their cultural relationship after all, we will still have a lot of puzzles, that is, in a more real way, the real Japanese to serve the Japanese in such a way. To reduce the cultural barrier above.

This is the part of the bamboo forest, which is the part of the bamboo forest, because it is actually the part of the bamboo forest in the whole big Tokyo. The part of the bamboo forest is actually a larger amount, so this place is the word. We continue to do only the original one to buy and sell.

We will continue to help our clients in addition to property management. Or rent out these management. We will probably expand the entire market in Tokyo. The property market for these bamboo forests in the area.

The hotel in Mazufeng is full of revenue and profit. We really are talking about the current stage. It is relatively conservative. It is that word every night. It is about the amount of $1000. It is about the current stage.

When you see the land of the living, you see the land of the living; when you see the land of the dead, you see the land of the living; when you see the land of the living, you see the land of the living; when you see the land of the living, you see the land of the living.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to confirm each timestamp corresponding sentence. Then, I need to group these sentences in logical and contextual relationships to form a coherent paragraph. For example, the parts of the market situation may need to be merged into a paragraph, while the information about the LG17 project is another paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the converted paragraph structure does not disrupt the original sequence of time.

In addition, questions and responses about the closure of the store also need to be formed as separate paragraphs. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the small errors in the timestamp, such as the user mentioned "2022" may be a mistake, because the context refers to the completion of 2032, so it may be necessary to confirm whether the content is correct, but according to the user requirements can not be modified, so keep it as it is.

In addition, there is a time interval between some sentences, such as [3225. 643227. 64], to ensure that these intervals do not affect the continuity of paragraphs after conversion. Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph verbatim, check if all sentences are correctly classified, no omissions or misplacements, and maintain the original verbatim content. At the same time, make sure that no additional information is added or deleted, and that the user's requirements are fully met.

That's why both parties look forward to the price and stick to it. So we'll see the most recent. The condition of a transaction is that the number of days in circulation will be slightly longer. If the number of days in circulation we can look at with the entire premium space.

So this is probably interpreted as a fact. In fact, there are some homeowners who have been selling in the market for a long time. They have already felt that it may be less representative of the house, or this is the case.

In fact, some homeowners may be considering money. Or buying a house, etc. He may be more willing to give more flexibility and amplitude in the price. So the number of days in circulation is slightly longer. And then a situation in the premium space is slightly higher. So the current situation looks more like this.

So we expect the whole way. We will think that the price should have entered into one in the short term. The whole situation is more like this. There is a question here. About that LG17 is our February.

This consecutive start of that forest station. The general direction of planning and the schedule also has the total amount of effect. Now. The estimated amount of investment is almost NT$1.6 billion. Then the total amount of sales includes the non-constructed income added together. It is estimated that it is about 2.1 billion.

This is an initial estimate. The current plan will start in 2027. It will start in 116. It is expected to be 2032. It will be completed in 2023.

They also wanted to be able to do this work as soon as possible. So if there is a process to talk to the supervisor, there is a relatively smooth talk. The next action delivery is also more successful.

There are investment friends who ask, because of the recent government policy. That refers to some real estate franchise stores that are closed. We do not have any plans to close the store to respond to such actions.

We will have one electricity meter. This will guide the shop to a condition. We will want to say that the service of the customer is good. Then the employee's confidence can pull it up. For this part of the conversation, we prefer to have a low temper and confidence.

So that's a response from an investor. You can use the blanks below the slide to enter your question. We'll answer it for you. An investor asks you the percentage of the 2024 broker's profit.

This is probably a ratio of 8 to 2. It is an intermediary 8 and then the distribution is 2. Today's law is going to go here. Thank you very much for your participation. The replay service will be placed on the investor relations website of the Company within one hour after the meeting.

You are now offline. thank you.
