<think> Well, the user let me turn the script every time, and can not be deleted or rewritten. First of all, I need to carefully check each point in the corresponding sentence to make sure that the order is in order. The user specifically emphasizes that there can be no omission of anything, so I want to twist the sentence. There are a lot of time and the corresponding sentence, some time may be interrupted when the user divides the sentence, for example, there may be a time interval in the middle, need to confirm whether the user is intentional, or enter an error. For example, in the original data, there is a large interval between some time, such as [31. 64-34. 20 and [35. 20-39. 12], there may be a space between the original, do not need to keep the middle line? According to the user's requirements, can not delete the content, so may keep this interval.

Next, I need to connect each sentence according to the sequence of time. For example, the first sentence is "morning for legal persons and media friends", and then the following sentence followed. At the same time, note that some time may correspond to the first half of the same sentence, such as there is no obvious break between some moments in the original text, may be wrong when the user divides the sentence. But the user requests do not modify the original text, so it is necessary to keep the original.

In addition, pay attention to the punctuation and synonyms to ensure that paragraphs are smooth. For example, at [63. 32-65.88] began to talk about German for 110 years, but after the U.S. tariff agreement, etc., it may be necessary to confirm whether the coherent. However, the user emphasizes that it cannot be rewritten, so directly according to the original arrangement, the reader may find logical jumps, but the user's request is to retain the original content, so it is not processed.

In addition, some sentences may involve terminology or company name, such as "Hokkaido Bank", "Hokkaido Securities", etc., need to confirm whether the spelling is correct, but also according to the original text of the user. Finally, after consolidating all the content, check whether there are missing times or sentences, and make sure that each sentence is in the correct position. At the same time, to ensure the transition between paragraphs naturally, the user may add appropriate links, but the user is not allowed to rewrite, so it can only be separated by empty lines or appropriate segments.

Order cash control benefits of $84.1 billion; and

Thank you for your comment. The next question is about what we are planning to do in Yangon, Myanmar. It also increases the working capital of the Vientiane Shone Church in Laos.

I think there are some minor issues here. I'll reply in order. The first is Yangon's ruling, because we actually observed Yangon for the past two years. In fact, it's a state of political instability. Then it's still a state of no rest for the civil war.

That takes into account the personal safety crisis as a whole is rising. That's another point. Because the office is responsible for the business. That's why we take a holistic view of the business and the economic environment as a whole. What to do with people's personal safety. So we decided to take a test.

The second part is Vientiane. Our general book of the week will increase by capital increase. That is an increase in working capital. That is mainly due to local changes in Laos. Lao Central amended their commercial banking law.

This is a requirement for us to meet the requirements. So we also have to increase capital. The third overall strategy for overseas development. Because overseas business is due to its spread. In some cases, the spread is still advantageous.

So it is still an important engine for the profitability of our banking industry. So we will continue to expand in this section. That is only because of the changes in the environment of some global economics. It is more intense than before. Then follow the rule of law risk.

So here we will make a prudent assessment. That's the part of the market. Because Tokyo will probably join operations by the end of the year. Singapore also expects to be included in our focus operations overseas next year.

In fact, we have an entire environment in the United States. We have a very positive view. So the United States is also a major market place. Is there a plan to merge the bases?

In fact, we are going to adapt to the economic environment as a whole. There is also the development of regional characteristics. We will make adjustments. So we will also make an assessment of the integration and development in the future. Should be done in parallel. A station for overseas profits.

This is more than just standing. Because the former overseas part of it was in the golden period, it was actually quite high standing. At that time I thought many of the industry could be standing. We talked about it like 30%, 20%, and 35%. But because of the later changes in the environment, there should be a reduction in the situation in the industry.

That is because we have had a colony for two or three years before Phnom Penh. That should be a convergence situation now. The mainland market is actually a more robust and conservative view, so we don't have much optimism here. We are more cautious about a conservative estimate. Thank you for asking.

Hello, thank you for your question. I would like to ask our fellow economist and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors.

Mr. Cai Rende. The last question is to ask Mr. Chen of the Ministry of Finance to report it. That is the question of a beautiful girlfriend.

The main thing is that we all know it is interfering with the US trade policy. So the biggest threat to the global economy right now is that uncertainty continues to exist. These decisions, such as investing, placing orders, and so on, are affecting vendors.

This uncertainty seems to be slowly moving at the moment. That's another part of the tax rate. Because the tax enclosing tariffs began on the release day of April 2. This schedule has been delayed in the future. So we see the effect of the global economy in the short term.

So this is the negative impact on the global economy at the moment. In fact, it is not obvious. That is, for example, IMF's report of world economic expectations released at the end of July. It is estimated that the global economic growth rate will be from 2.8% in April this year.

So this is the outlook for the global economy. In fact, it is not too pessimistic. That is, if the countries look at it, it is also because the U.S. manufacturers are facing the impact of this tariff. So there is an early order for stockings. So this first half of the year.

The economic growth rate, including Japan in Europe and Taiwan, has been affected by this. It is better than expected. So overall, it is estimated that the impact of tariffs on the economy is now estimated. It is lower than originally expected. That is Taiwan.

No. But compared to traditional industries. The level of tolerance for tariffs and exchange rates is higher than that of electronics. Because gross interest rates are relatively low, so the tolerance is also relatively weak.

The government needs more support. That's the part of the exchange rate. That's what I see from this point of view. Because now the market is universal. The annual forecast is expected to be at the end of September. So there will be some pressure on the dollar.

According to your rules, I will re-arrange the transcripts into paragraphed transcripts without deleting or rewriting any sentences. The independence of Fed has been questioned by some of the political interventions, causing the market to worry. In addition, the issue of U.S. finances will also have a more negative effect on the confidence in the U.S. assets. So this trend of weakness in the U.S. dollars is generally a relatively large consensus.

In other words, the exchange rate of each country, in fact, is not only affected by the trend of the dollar, but also by the individual import and export of each country, as well as his foreign exports, etc., as well as the impact of central bank policies. So this is a point in the future can determine the direction of the future trend of the NT dollar. Above, thank you.

This is the first time that we have been asked to do this by the Secretary of State for the Treasury to report on this talk. The second half of the second half of the project will be carefully considered, thank you. Well, the answer to the media's question is that we have a strategy for the second half of the project, which I think is divided into stock market and bond market.

So, we are a relatively stable investment in the stock market. So we will choose to invest in oil stocks that have a stable operation to train the ability to invest. That is because the lap season has passed, but we will look at the industry's prospects to make some adjustments that are too weak. In terms of market, the interest rate is also very volatile, especially in a U.S. bond market. Just as our chief economist also said, the general expectation is that the cost may be at the FOMC meeting in September, which will reduce the interest rate very high. But the market has already responded, but there is one view that it is just a preventive rate.

Therefore, long-term interest rates are volatile and fluctuating. So in the U.S., we will also carefully assess the placements and control the duration of the entire placement. If the investment parts are in place, we will look at the status of our funds to flexibly adjust.

The last question is about the transition between Taiwan stocks and the U.S. debt. Just as our chief economist also said, we are talking about Taiwan, the industry, under the guidance of semiconductor AI-related industries, is actually the focus of funds in these industries.

So, we look at the outlook for the future. The Taiwan Bonds section has already mentioned that the fluctuations in interest rates are quite large, because of the expected rate of the Fed's decline. But compared to the previous implementation of the tariffs, everyone lost confidence in the U.S. bonds.

So the outlook for U.S. bonds today should be relatively prudent and optimistic. But the layout is to choose a point of entry and exit with a fluctuating interest rate. Well, more than that, live media friends ask, do you have a new loan balance in the first half of the year? Thank you for asking.

The first half of the year, the mortgage of our media friends, probably grew to five to seven parties, which is the current state of the contract, because the amount is very large, the control way is in fact we are mainly with our bank gradually as a loan. Basically, the approved case we will soon give him the most likely that he will be able to play this year. Thank you. Online media friends ask, what is the current land-building dragon balance, and what is the work done this year? What are the loan control measures? Thank you, because there are two questions, the first question I want to ask our deputy of the law department to answer, the second question, or our deputy of the department, Cai, to answer the question.

In the future, in this section, we expect that there are about 660 billion of this amount, which is currently in the application. So this amount is very large, so we just have to say that we have approved the case for this year, and the other parts of this place will be according to the state of our protection ring, to see if there is any more charge to these customers to bear, this is probably the case. Thank you. Online comrades ask why do you want to cut the balance?

Thank you. This is a question that we ask the bank's accounting department to explain. Thank you.

Dear customers, now is the difference in our deposit. The part of the dollar is mainly affected by the rise in interest rates in March last year. The interest rate on loans is the negative effect, so it makes the overall difference in the whole year.

Compared to the same period last year, micro-coins have dropped by 3 BPs. As for the difference in foreign currencies, mainly the increase in the amount of foreign currencies. It is much larger than the increase in foreign currency deposits. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve will start from September last year.

As of now, interest rates have been reduced by 14 yards. This made 114 as of the end of June. Foreign currency deposit rates. As low as 113 during the same period.

In addition, foreign currency deposit difference. Compared to Taiwan dollar. The decline is more than the extent. It is expected to drop more than 4.8 BP. Online media friends ask. How do you see the development of stable currency in China?

Well, that's not a buzzing question. We asked the Chief Economist of our Nuclear Treasury. Dr. Chien-Ti Hsu to answer. Well, now the media asks. This question has some complexity. Maybe there is no way to do this today.

It's clear to say, in general, that the recent issue of stablecoins is hot. It's mainly because of the US government. It's the US president, Mr. Trump, who has issued two executive orders.

The U.S. has his strategic considerations. That is to hope that the compliance of stablecoins will be legal. And then give some norms. Especially for stablecoin issuers. The stablecoin issuers set him in this reserve.

There is a large part of it to buy US bonds. He has this. The motivation to support such a strategy is to take into account. So, of course, this is the trend of such a big policy. The countries for stablecoins are of course the beginning. There is also a breakthrough in such a development.

This includes Hong Kong, etc. These countries. They each have policies. The stablecoin is what he means by his name. It is actually a payment. The main purpose of the payment is to pay. Because it corresponds to fiat 1 to 1.

That's why it's his main function right now. Or how to follow this crypto. Do a docking between the other cryptocurrencies. This is his most important function. That's what Taiwan says. Taiwan has always been.

That said, our staking in Taiwan is very early in the interpretation. It is also the development of this CBDC. It is the central bank's digital currency. So the stablecoin in China is the stablecoin. If the media refers to the stablecoin in Taiwan, then this is the one with the CBDC.

How do you coordinate this with one another? This is the way the development of such a view. That is, if you put this stable currency in the land, it seems to be a payment instrument. That is because this electronic payment environment in Taiwan is very mature.

Therefore, there is no need to issue. The stability of the domestic currency. It is possible to look at the market needs again. But you want to see how the future is. It is the international dollar stability of the currency. He if as an international payment structure and instruments.

Especially if it is possible to replace this in the future. SWIFT is similar to the US dollar payment system. If it is not that time in the country, or if it is not so timely, keep up with the international trends. Or if it is able to meet the needs of this customer.

We may have to avoid it. That is, Taiwan is in this new payment system. It is threatened or contributed by this marginalization.

Thank you for your support.
