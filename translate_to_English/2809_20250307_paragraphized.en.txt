<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided copy-paste fragments into paragraph-paste transcripts. First, I need to read the original contents of the user carefully to ensure that the user understands the corresponding sentences at each point in time. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be retained in a sentence-by-word manner.

First of all, I will check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp to confirm that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the verbs provided by the user are timestamps such as [0. 00-4.00], and the sentences are "good, that time is almost the same, and we start with them." Next, I need to arrange these sentences in chronological order and organize them into natural smooth paragraphs while keeping the original intention intact. It is important to note that users may want to have proper separation between paragraphs, such as switching between different topics. For example, the openings, financial reports, Q&A sections should be separated.

For example, when answering a question, there is a repeated mention of the "third dividend policy", which requires all retention, not merger or deletion. In the process, I also need to pay attention to the uniformity of punctuation and format, such as the comma, the correct use of the sentence, whether the timestamp needs to be retained, etc. The user's example, the timestamp is omitted, so the final output should only retain the sentence content, sorted by paragraph. Finally, I will read the paragraph-text after finishing, to ensure that there is no omission of any sentences, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, in line with the logic of spoken expression.

In summary, my steps are: 1. Check and keep everything in chronological order; 2. Sub-sections based on topic; 4. Keep the original intention and format correct. Make sure that it is fully compatible with the requirements of the user without any deletions. </think> [paragraph type transcription]: OK, that's almost the same time, we'll start first.

So, I'll start with a simple financial numeral report, and then I'll go back to our Q&A section. Well, that's the first part of our presentation, and that's the first part of the page that shows the overall operational overview of our 2024, and the last part that we'll mention later, so let's take a look at it first. Well, that's the main reason for our review throughout the year. That concludes that our overall profit in 2024 is about 4% less than the previous year.

As we have mentioned before, our revenue decline in 2024 is mainly from other revenues. So you can see that the revenue share of other revenues is a significant decrease compared to the previous year. Well, then it is the part of our operating performance, whether it is in revenue gain or tax mishaps, it is a slight decline compared to the previous year. This also leads to a slight increase in our operating expenses, but we still control the revenue portion of our operations at a reasonable level.

That's also because of the decline in profits, so we have a slight decline in ROE or ROA. Well, and then the part of our net and deposit spreads. In fact, the increase in spreads is our goal all the time. We can see that we have maintained a steady growth trend in the fourth quarter of last year, both at NIM and SPREM.

In the past, we also mentioned that although the total amount of our deposits is not too much change, but in terms of the deposit structure, our survival ratio is actually improved, which is reflected in the previous few times that we have mentioned, is a business policy to enhance the core deposit. This part of the lending structure does not have too much change here, our lending classes are mainly made in Taiwan dollars, cash, and other parts of the products are mainly concentrated in small and medium-sized enterprises. Good, and then our bond investment, then we can see that the upper part is our domestic bond, the lower part is our domestic bond, and the lower part is our domestic bond. The first part is the domestic bond, we have a slight increase in yield with our part, the Duration has a slight reduction, the overseas bond is not really a big change.

I think we have a simple report on the results of our operations in 2024, and then to the vice president, let's go to the meeting. I think it's easy to talk about our entire operations last year, and then we open Q&A. But before you ask a question, I'd like to clarify some of the timelines for this acquisition. I think we're going to get into this together and I'll define three important milestones.

The first Milestone is a shareholder consul, which was passed on March 3 on both sides. Then the second Milestone is called the share transfer day, which is the premise that the share transfer day after the filing of the document will be reviewed under the premise of the filing of the document. If it is approved, then it will go to a date after the filing of the document, and it will be reviewed after the filing of the document, which we expect to be in the fourth quarter of this year, if everything goes smoothly.

I would like to ask him about the reason for the growth of the spread, and the content of the February canceled loan will not be withdrawn, and the situation of the dividend policy this year, thank you. Well, three questions, the first is the growth of the spread, the second is the situation of the February loan canceled, and the third is the dividend, this year's dividend policy.

In the past year, we have been talking to our friends at the end of February, and we have been talking about the growth of the spread, not the growth of its volume. So this last year we have been working on a relatively conservative and stable way of fighting, so the main reason for the growth of the spread is to increase the interest rate of the selling life. Well, the second question is that in February, we have a situation in which the 900 million lifetime is guaranteed, because it is expected to be three months, and that the golden city bank used to focus on our relatively abundant capital and profitability, so as long as we expect three months to open, it will not be like the general bank is to negotiate some action, so we will be directly included in the end of February we are in the book, that the portion of the guarantee sales of the industrial plant and the land, the current valuation is about 1.3 billions, so we are evaluated that this we can be enough enough to be recycled.

So we want to use a relatively stable way of dividends. Come to our shareholders have a relatively stable interest rate. That's because this year's situation is a bit more special. That's because it involves taking the responsibility to convert from Yongdong Financial Holdings. So we have to think more about some of the reasons.

Thank you so much. That's a good question to ask. That's why I said it before. I hope to maintain more than 50% of the Payout Ratio. Is that going to continue this year?

That's exactly what I'm talking about this year. I think it's because I want to join Yongdong Financial Holding. That's because everyone's situation is different in general. In fact, it feels like the actual tax rate of the shareholders is 40%. There are also 12% different tax rates. It even takes into account the cost of encouraging the distribution of 2,100 million second-generation health insurance.

So we're going to look at the whole thing to consider whether it's the same to maintain 50%. We're going to take a little bit more into it, and then put a little consideration in it. Thank you, that's another part of the question.

It is the traditional industry of metal. There is no other possibility that there will be another big selling point in the book. This may be thought that this situation is only known when it is faced. At present, there is no thank you. You will not say that we are prepared and do not allow some more likely selling.

"I think the wealth of the Bank of Kyoto is very clean. So we have nothing to hide from this bad life. I believe it will never be like this. So unless it is really a ring that has not paid interest for three months, we will be included in the situation between prevention. And we will be held accountable for it.

This is what we always do. Thank you. I'm also a little addicted to this. It's because there are two things that matter to the book after a temporary meeting of shareholders. The first one is a relatively large prevention.

Then we had a previous book and then there was a recall. Those two events were not really related to the merger. But it was time for us to be very positive. We follow our past partners to deal with it. So it was a very neutral event.

Thank you. You just said a case of a bill recovery. When that happens, I'll also clarify that because I didn't have a specific account, but it should actually happen.

That's why we were involved in this in December 107. At that time, we had to open 16.4 billion. At that time, we finally got rid of some of its single policies. In principle, we had the opportunity to recycle 19.2 billion. But this is only after the official entry.

I think we're going to make a formal announcement. But this is the time to enter the account. I think if it's as smooth as possible, about the end of June. The premise, of course, is that it's smooth. Because it's a lot of distribution problems.

There is a time when the court can ask again, and there is no escape from the fact that last year's edition of the book is only two or three cases.

In fact, from China to later a few relatively large cases. Some of the single products. We have been working very hard all these years on the handling. But as the previous law says, it's a lot of the time it's stuck in. Because it requires an auction process.

It was in court or some procedures. So I don't dare to say anything about it here. But I can only guarantee that we will continue to do so. I'll ask again, because now the nationals will pass.

It is like the golden city camp management here. It is the view of this year's Jinlisha. It is a deposit business, or investment, or this strategy. It is probably what happens after the National Assembly. Thank you.

This is what we are talking about, for example, including some of us. Overall, we are looking for some business, or some policy direction. There are no changes. For example, we are not going to be attacked by viruses.

Then there is a change of policy. Unless there is actually a stock going on now. We are more than the two sides to manage the conclusion. There are some of us in some parts of the city. Because the mergers do some discussion between each other. There are some details of communication.

We have already begun to enter this process, the whole process. As for the credit policy of the bank, there are various aspects, there are also margins, I think we will not change.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I would like to ask you, because now the National Assembly has passed. The next is the preparatory documents. There are other cases.

And when they heard this, they said, 'This is what we have heard, and what we have seen is what we have heard, and what we have not heard, and what we have seen is what we have heard, and what we have not seen, and what we have seen is what we have heard, and what we have not heard.'

We don't have an estimate of approximation. It's probably time to complete this. Then when the documents can be taken up to the usual venue. Now, we'll have to ask again what questions we need to solve. Thank you. I really want to start the file.

It's probably going to be handled by Fortune Wings Club. I don't find it easy to answer them when they can be delivered. That part of my public security plan is actually voting on February 26. Our guild didn't pass.

Or they will be able to communicate with our Guilds, and they will come out with friendly programs, but the Guilds will continue to work with them, and we will not be able to ask any questions here, because after all, the management is here, and there is nothing to intervene to guide them.

I think the two sides should have a bigger pattern. Then look at the human capital in the long run. I believe whether it is the future of the red gold control, or our colleagues in Jinchengyang. They are more long-term. Then we look at this.

It is a good thing to be able to communicate well, and then to finish the book early. It is a self-contained, self-contained, reinforcing.

I would like to compare. We are less concerned about security. This is because we actually have a trust in assets at first, so real estate is a drop in our bank.

Ask them what they are doing, and they will tell you what they are doing, and they will tell you what they are doing, and we will tell you what they are doing, and we will tell you what they are doing.

No matter how big or small the loan is. We are all active in the disposal. Not because of the combination of this factor. There are special changes in some of our direction and policy.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript: [1155. 42-1156. 42] is not really sure at the moment. [11911. 42-1203. 42] I don't know if you have any other questions to ask. [1203. 42-1205. 42] Yes. [1205. 42-1211. 42] Please ask the General Manager. [1211. 42-1214. 42] You just answered another legal person's question.

[1214. 42-1215. 42] That's about legal policy. [1215. 42-1218. 42] That's why you mentioned that this year because of the merger, so there are more considerations to consider. [1218. 42-1220. 42] That's not to say that encouraging pairing rates may not be the same as last year. [1222. 42-1229. 42] Encouragement matching rates may not be the same as last year. [1229. 42-1231. 42] This also exists.

[1231. 42-1232.42] That is the case. [1232. 42-1233.42] Thanks. [1235. 42-1239.42] I am sorry that this question can be answered now. [1239. 42-1241.42] Because it is after all the authority of the Board. [1241. 42-1247.42] But I believe that the Board of Directors considers the entire general board of directors. [1247. 42-1249.42] After all it involves a lot of shareholders.

[1249. 42-1252. 42] Some substantial benefits of his shareholding conversion. [1252. 42-1256. 42] So we have to think about it. [1256. 42-1258. 42] So we have to think about it. [1258. 42-1271. 42] That I would like to ask for it. [1271. 42-1275. 42] Because you say that you will consider the conversion, so encourage that it is the conversion of the fight that is out of the box. [1275. 42-1277. 42]

[1277. 42-1278. 42] That's because you're going to think about that conversion. [1278. 42-1279. 42] That's because you're going to think about that conversion. [1279. 42-1280. 42] So what you're talking about is the one you're going to earn. [1280. 42-1281. 42] What the Tsu community is talking about. [1281. 42-1282. 42] What the Tsu community is talking about. [1282.12-1285. 42] This time will be longer than it was in previous years.

[1285. 42-1286. 42] Because you have not yet delivered the goods. [1286. 42-1287. 42] is consent. [1287. 42-1289. 42] Because we will be a bit more stable for shareholders this year. [1289. 42-1292. 42] Shareholders will normally take care until the end of June. [1292. 42-1293. 42-1294. 42] Good.

[1294. 42-1309. 42] That's another question that you both want to send. [1301. 42-1303. 42] That's exactly when you expect to send it. [1303. 42-1305. 42-1307. 42] Same as Taiwan Nova and Star Collections. [1307. 42-1309. 42] Both of them want to send it. [1309. 42-1311. 42] That's why you should also send it here.

[1315. 42-1319. 42] Yes, so the delivery time will be coordinated with Yongfeng there. [1324. 42-1326. 42] That's another question. [1326. 42-1329. 42] Because Yongfeng buys only silver and silver. [1329. 42-1333. 42] They say that securities and leases are not the targets they want to buy and sell. [1333. 42-1338. 42] The liquidation of your securities and leases is still pending. [1338. 42-1344. 42]

[1347. 42-1351.42] I think the two subsidiaries part. [1351. 42-1354.42] And one of our grand-daughters is Jianjin. [1354. 42-1354.42] The current idea is to sell it if it can be disposed of. [1360. 42-1362.6.42] That's what I think. [1362. 42-1363.4.42] Now it's probably the two of us.

[1369. 42-1372. 42] That is the current idea. [1372. 42-1374. 42-1379. 42] If this is the case, it will be disposed of. [1374. 42-1379. 42] That is to say there is no such thing. [1379. 42-1381. 42] This can be disposed of at what time. [1381. 42-1383. 42] I have no way of knowing. [1383. 42-1386. 42] But in principle, we will do it as soon as possible.

[1386. 42-1390.42] If it is able to be handled before the share conversion date. [1386. 42-1390.42] We sell it. [1423. 42-1425.42] We are copying. [1434. 42-1441.42] There is a saying operator in [1434. 42-1452.42] He is placed on the next page.
