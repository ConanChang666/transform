The current time is 2:30pm. Our 6288 Falun Gong explanation will be officially launched. That reminds you to turn your phone into a vibration or mute. The meeting will begin. It will be official. It is a privilege to be invited to the chief of the household today.

In such a great atmosphere and space for the conference. Then we will introduce you to the guests who are coming today. Please use our warm applause to welcome the Chairman of the Optoelectronics Huang Guoxing. General Manager of Huang Zongyu. Vice President of Mr. Wu Chun-de.

Mr. Yang Shenghua, Vice President of Technology. Mr. Lin Ziwei, Vice President. Next, we will give our time to the memory team of the family.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to you. I am Mr. Huang, General Manager of Photovoltaic. I would also like to thank our organizer, Guotai Securities, for their enthusiastic support in organising a wonderful and full-fledged legal meeting. Today, I would like to share with you our disclaimer.

First of all, we share the performance of our operations. Our revenue from January to February this year was $9.47 billion. The operating cost was $4.5 billion compared to the same period last year. This operating cost was 93% growth. Our revenue contribution mainly comes from the Americas, which is 85%.

When it comes to product contributions, we are still in the automotive industry as our main business. That's why our lights represent 93% of our revenue.

The second is the green operation project. The second is the green operation project. Green energy products. Green energy products. Next is other industrial applications.

In fact, our company's revenues have been greatly affected. We have declined for two consecutive years since 2019, and we have only slowly recovered from our revenues in 2022. Last year we slowly recovered to our normal growth rate. Because we had a growth rate of about 25% to 35% in the past year. So last year we had a growth in revenues.

28% If you look at the water chart, you can see that we have a lot of important financial indicators above. They have a large growth rate. Whether it is gross profit rate or pre-tax net profit. There is a certain percentage of growth. If the balance sheet is for you to refer to it.

We have an interest table with the total assets and total liabilities. Currently, our net worth is 15.96%. Next, we share with you the market where our main products work with us. Our main business is 70 trillion people. The current market size is about $356 billion. This is based on 2023 statistics.

From 2024 to 2032. The annual compound growth rate reached more than 7% growth rate. Major car lighting includes several projects. The biggest source of revenue is car lamps. The front lamp is tail light. Then there are special lighting each accounted for 20%.

In the past few years, automobile sales have continued to grow. Waiting for you to see the proportion of the whole production and sales growth. The second is actually the growth of lighting and other things. There are more and more functions of the whole car. So the use of electronic equipment materials are more and more.

That's using a car light to show the uniqueness of a car. Like everyone can see that many cars like Tesla GM have a good design. And the main attraction is the car light. The tail light is the soul of a car. So the company's main source of income is the previous one.

Today's lights are more than lighting. And there's also a lot of interaction with road users. That's why the connected cars have become an important trend. It also led to an increase in revenue. The level of sales around the world is getting closer to our customers. So you can see what we're working with Megadon on the left.

A fuzzy situation in the last few years. Slowly you can see that they have a significant growth in our order. That right is Fovie & Hella. He is a German company later merged by a French company.

So our growth in the coming years is mainly the first one. Our key customers give us orders outside of the stable. There has been a significant growth. The second is that our customers are growing more and more. Like recently we have added two world manufacturers. We have started to place our future orders with us.

That's why this is the second driving force for our growth. The third is that we always value new product research and development. That's why our technology is constantly improving. Our products have been designed and designed by our customers. That's why we'll see a significant growth in our performance in the coming years.

We share it with you so far. Our company's top five customers. The first one is Megadon. Basically, he's the third in the world's top 100 automotive electronics components in 2024. The second one is Kela. Basically, it's the ninth in the world of automotive electronics components.

However, it is also the fourth best selling car light. Then it is Flexingate. It is the top 100 automotive electronic components inside. #36. The back Sanli and Koido. Koido is the world's number one supplier of car light.

Their American factory is called NAL. We have a partnership with orders. The fourth partner is Sanli in Korea. They are the fifth-place supplier of global lights. So we work with the top few in the world.

Whether it is a payment method or a new product trend. These guests are leaders in the entire industry. Good for us company. It's just a traditional pickup truck. The traditional fuel truck. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will read the whole transcript, paying attention to the timestamp and the content. It looks like there is a larger interval between timestamps, for example after [699. 50-700. 54], the next timestamp is [713. 34-717. 62], and there is a gap in the middle of about 13 seconds. This may be due to the pause of the speaker or the technical issue, but the user requests not to delete anything, so these parts must be kept. Next, I need to reorganize the phrases that are phrased as a continuous paragraph. For example, a few words at the beginning are about the company's production of fuel vehicles and electric vehicles, and should be merged into a paragraph. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic, such as mention of multiple electric vehicle brands (Tesla, Rivan, etc.), which should be put together.

At the same time, pay attention to whether the sequence of timestamps is correct. For example, after [699. 50-700. 54], the user mentions "Wait", and the next timestamp is [713. 34-414. 62], the same repeats "Wait".

In addition, some sentences may contain non-Chinese characters or garbled characters, such as "&%$%" and "", which also need to be reserved, not to be deleted or modified. The user specifically points out that they cannot be rewritten, so even if these parts look problematic, they must be retained in the same way. During the processing process, it is also important to pay attention to situations where Chinese and English are mixed, such as "GM Cadillac" and "32 million dollars", which need to be properly presented and kept as it is. At the same time, some sentences may involve technical terms or terminology, such as "ODM", "LED package", etc., to ensure the correctness of these terms.

Finally, make sure the structure of the entire paragraph-by-text text is clear, logical, and strictly adheres to the user's requirements without missing anything. After the initial draft, I will read again to confirm that all the sentences are correctly arranged, with no omissions or errors, and that the format is in compliance with the requirements. </think> The following is a paragraph-by-text text (totally preserved, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed of anything else): --- We also have a lot of electric vehicles, whether they are Tesla, Rivian, that Cadillac, Porsche, and Fisca.

Today I want to share with you that GM Cadillac is one of the most famous electric vehicles in the world, and one of the most expensive electric vehicles in the world. So I would like to share with you that this car represents the strength of our company. GM has never been a car outside the light to a company, most of which are designed separately for three companies. But our company is very proud that all of the lights are visible to everyone, and the exterior light is our company's design and production. So I want to share with you. [694. 90-696. 94] It doesn't seem to move.

[697. 20-699. 26] How to turn it past. [699. 50-700. 54] Please wait. [713. 34-740. 62] Please wait. [718. 50-730. 54] Please wait a little while. [742. 82-744. 10] Yes. [744. 36-745. 90] Zoom in.

[748. 50-754. 64] Please watch all of these dynamic lights. [754. 90-757. 46] Designs made through our company's R&D team. [757. 72-760. 02] All of these. [778. 50-785. 92] Lise. [791. 04-793. 86] Because of its popularity. [797. 18-800. 52] Very unjust.

[804. 62-808. 14] &%$% [808. 50-814. 90] OK. [814. 90-816. 88] Just this one. [816. 88-819. 60] Represents the customer's trust in us. [819. 60-823. 02] Very new. [823. 02-824. 28] Very forward-looking technology.

[825. 84-27. 62] Well, let's share what we've had in the past year, every 6.2 new cars are our products. In the past few years, because of various factors, our market share has declined a little, but by 2025, now every 6.5 new cars have one of our products, so back to our market share. Well, let's take a look at that, from 2020 to 2024, the sales volume of the entire global automobile is a big breakthrough, from 7719 million vehicles is now 9155 million, mainly because more and more developing countries are able to buy cars, especially in China, a lot of electric vehicles are already affordable, so this is the main source of growth.

This is a statistic of what Global Mobility has done over the next five years, and they expect the traditional cars to drop from 60 million to 40 million, sorry, the traditional cars will fall from 60 million, then the electric vehicles will fall from 1510 million to 45 million, then the other hybrid vehicles will grow slightly. But you can see, after President Trump has been elected recently, he has been encouraging people not to use electric vehicles, and he feels that carbon reduction is not as urgent. So the company believes it should be a slight reduction, but it is not so obvious that only 40 million cars in 2029. But customers will be happy to design new products and mass production.

Our company has always felt that a business must be sustainable core technical capabilities, so we are out of the difference with our peers. So we have the first thing is our ability to have LED packaging, for our modules we have a niche for defect integration. The second we have a strong optical team, and then we have the ability to heat flow analysis, we have the ability to design mechanical molds, the ability to design electronic circuits, and the team of soft firmware design.

But after we took the customer's test costs, our own internal test may only cost us 4 million million, other internal test, you can have this kind of profitability, and accelerated research and development. So basically, the strength of our company is that we have mastered the key technology, that is, the key technology of vehicle lighting and heating. In addition, our products have always been patented, and we can have a difference with others. In addition, we can quickly make customized design according to the needs of our customers.

So far, there are 146 patents we have received, and there are 89 pending applications. This is where you can see the technology that we continue to increase our patents every quarter. Lenovo believes it is important not to give our customers only one or two products, as our dependence, stickiness, demand will not continue to increase. So we hope that we can provide a one-stop ODM service, which includes we offer a wide range of lamps for the whole car, including headlights, fence lights, sign lights, door light, backlights, etc.

This is also our new field, which can increase a lot of revenue for us. In addition to our own internally maintained photo-heating standard laboratory, and EMI EMC certified laboratory. Finally, we also provide, in addition to the light source, we also provide ECU-driven, circuit-driven services, so that a complete one-stop service, so that customers are more and more satisfied with our dependence.

So, I think it's important that Taiwan's business scale is not large, but because we have innovative energy, the world will look at us with great determination to long-term cooperation. We have built in Mexico in the past years, is from some of the LEDs we need to do development, so there is a vertical integration of the company's niche, and at the same time these LEDs are also sold to the automotive industry related customers, and we will continue to do so in the next few years.

So we can know that if Mexican factory to supply to customers, and to Europe customers, North America customers, in fact, can save a lot of shipping costs and time, with the materials available. We at the factory in Mexico, we have chosen a place, mainly because we are next to the customer, let the customer work with us, first we have Megana, we will be there for 25 minutes, so the customer is very close, so this way can work closely together. Then again Hela has two factories, then NAL is Coido, then Sandy is Korean company, Valeo is Chinese company, ZKW is an Australian company.

Well, that's our Mexican factory, it's an indication that it's going to be a long one, and now it's going to be a long one. We've started this in 2024, and we want to be able to complete it in September to October this year, and then we'll get the certification of the car, about six months, and we'll get the IATF16949 certification. Then our orders will be shipped in China this year, about September to October. This shows that the customer's determination to work with us for a long time, because they're willing to work with us, we'll be able to produce them elsewhere before we're ready, and then we'll go to Mexico for mass production.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcript:. This has had a big impact, but this year we saw it approaching break even in the first quarter. So we can see that every plant can contribute to the company's revenue and profits in the future.

The first is that we will have advanced research and development technology, and then design into the new car, the components we have selected, and the components we can control. So this is our niche, ODM role. The second is that we have recently been more successful in the implementation of automation, we have spent a lot of time exploring automation, so the introduction of automation robots and some AI software will reduce our costs. The third is that we are all close to our customers, so we can reduce the waste of packaging materials and the shipping costs and carbon emissions.

In addition to the increasing amount of materials that we design to share more and more, our purchasing power can reduce the cost of our materials. In addition, our energy-saving products also gradually diversify our products through our business, which is the smarter and more intelligent, which allows us to make our original products from the production of our own raw materials, we are slowly becoming the whole system manufacturer, and some things are to take others together, and then become a large system service customer our revenue can increase and compare to an investment that is not a heavy asset.

In addition, we often say that the society we want to take advantage of should not be equal to money to do good or not wait for our company is 10 billion billion companies, so we actually have a large percentage of the company is between 6% and 10%, so we can see that the company's distance is positive and that many of our directors give us a lot of guidance from the company in the past year.

It's good to talk about our company's future outlook for the first time that our company follows except the automotive industry.

There are various strategies. Today we have two reports for you. My personal reports are all based on the company's current major revenue sources. So it is more relevant to the automotive industry than energy saving.

We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help. We're here to help.

Because it contributes a lot to society, so I'm going to explain it here first. It's important when it's established. We are one of the few companies in the world to do LED lighting. So we're a pioneer in energy conservation and environmental protection. And we're gradually adding some business projects.

This includes the sense of smart lighting. Energy storage projects. This adds to our contribution to energy-saving and environmental-friendly businesses. The automotive photovoltaic industry is our business. We are the world's leading manufacturer of innovative light sources for the automotive industry.

As our goal is to follow our wishes. We want to continue to have a global presence. Follow Taiwan. Then we continue to add our innovative products. We are waiting for you to see.

Then, we continued to expand our customer base. In fact, we had to get the first customer order at the time. It took a lot of five years, but now we have a lot of time. If there are new customers coming in, it will be much faster.

That's why we're expanding our customer base. Increase our operations. Give our customers more time to pick up. The third is the creative food and beverage industry. That's what everyone can see.

This is the flagship store of our first ultimate restaurant. We were the first LVD to be a virtual restaurant. That is what we wanted for our consumer market. We wanted to bring a completely different experience. We created this ultimate restaurant.

This is the land of the living, the land of the dead, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the sea of the living, the sea of the living, the sea of the living.

There is the ultimate experience to enjoy. It's a very important task for us. So I hope you all can try it today. We have some snacks prepared for you. There are also souvenirs. We know the AI industry.

It is a future trend. At the same time, we have a lot of high-tech talent in our company. As long as some of the teams that introduce AI come in again, we can be in our existing applications.

Like us in the transportation field. We all have long-term partners with ink and long-term cooperation. Therefore, the chairman of the meeting will also explain to you. We for AI. What are some touchpoints. Some concerns for the future.

That's the growth of our new business. First, we move from industrial products. Move to the automotive industry. Slowly turn to us and we'll also do storage.

In addition, it is an immersive display. Enter the entertainment market. The third is the real opportunity for our public engineering. It will help us in the future in the smart city.

The Internet of Things in AI. Grassroots facilities. Make a contribution. This part of the board is what the president has to say. That's what our ultimate restaurant features. Share it with us a little bit.

If you have time, welcome to stay. You can enjoy it. You have to eat a meal for an hour and a half. It's like you're traveling around the world. All of a sudden you're indoors.

You're probably going to the Palace of Versailles. You're going to the Palace of Versailles again. As if you were going to Niagara Falls. You'd probably go to Egypt to see a pyramid. It's probably a children's day. He's like going to Disney World.

Or the sea world. It is a meal that allows them to feel like they are traveling all over the world. There are different experiences, even if they are not able to travel abroad.

Or the parents of all the parents. Grandparents are welcome to come. He may be able to enjoy the food in this environment.

I don't show it here. I turn it off. The brand vision of our restaurant. The first Tesla we want to be in the catering industry.

Because Tesla is our long-term strategic partner. So we use this slogan from me. Because we can see Tesla. It's not just a car. It gives us a lot of the leading electric vehicle technology. It even starts to do electric.

I don't know if anyone has seen it. It has a battery house. A house is only 7800 bucks. You can have one. It looks like a room about 4 pings 5 pings. It's constantly helping people.

An innovative product with technology. That's what we want us to be in the food and beverage industry. It also brings consumers. Experience. Very satisfied with the senses of the five officers.

So we're technology for our appliances. We're delicious as our language. We want everyone to be in this environment. Immerse yourself in this environment. Enjoy the great cuisine and high-tech. So we're building the whole of Taiwan.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that the structure and content of each part are understood. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite or condensate any sentence, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order and maintains the integrity of each sentence.

First of all, I will check whether the original content has timestamps or other markings that may need to be retained or adjusted. There is a lot of timestamps in the transcripts provided by the user, such as [2528. 98-2529. 98], which may need to be retained in the final paragraph script, but the user does not specify whether timestamps need to be retained, so further confirmation may be required. However, based on the example responses provided by the user, timestamps are retained before each sentence, so I need to follow this format.

At the same time, note that the speaker may change the transition of topics, such as "Sorry I want to pull back" sentences, which may require either a separate paragraph or a combination of both before and after content. In addition, note that the transitions and corrections in the lectures, such as "not a restaurant" and "now I'm talking about the automotive industry," which need to be clearly marked and may need to be separated by empty or indentation in the paragraphs. At the same time, the content of the Q&A session also needs to be properly segmented to ensure that the corresponding relationship between the questions and answers is clear.

In addition, it is necessary to ensure the consistency of each paragraph, but not the content that does not match different themes. Finally, check for missing sentences or formatting errors to ensure that all content is properly converted and in line with the user's requirements. It may be necessary to read multiple times to confirm that the position and paragraph division of each sentence are reasonable, while keeping the correct correspondence of the timestamp. In summary, the process steps include: 1. Preserve all original content, not subtracting; 2. Divide according to topic and logic; 3. Keep the timestamps and original format; 4. Ensure that the oral expressions and transitions are natural.

[2763. 98-2768. 98] Welcome to raise your hand. [2764. 98-2767. 98] The staff will give you a microphone to speak. [2775. 98-2776. 98] Disliked. [2776. 98-2778. 98] Chairman Mr. Huang. [2778. 98-2782. 98] I would like to thank you for your wonderful speech today. [2782. 98-2783. 98] I would like to ask you a question.

[2783. 98-2788. 98] We move or grow our business this year. [2788. 98-2789. 98] It seems to be the whole. [2789. 98-2791. 98] And then there is something just mentioned. [2791. 98-2794. 98] There are some factors in gross profit margin that may be mitigated this year. [2794. 98-2796. 98] What we look at this year is the change in gross profit margin. [2796. 98-2797. 98] Above.

[2800. 98-2802. 98] Thanks for asking. [2802. 98-2805. 98] Basically, it has just been briefly mentioned in the last few years. [2805. 98-2810. 98] Our main profit reduction is the reason. [2810. 98-2815. 98] One of the largest factories in our Michigan plant. [2815. 98-2817. 98] In fact, the economic processing rate is only 30%. [2817. 98-2818. 98] So there is no way to support them.

[2818. 98-2820. 98] There is no way to support such a plant. [2820. 98-2823. 98] So last year there was actually a loss of every month. [2823. 98-2825. 98] After we helped him transform it. [2825. 98-2830. 98] Since June last year, the main staff had left 12 employees. [2830. 98-2832. 98] That was the key person.

[2835. 98-2837. 98] So they have a lot of good skills. [2837. 98-2839. 98] We have a temporary period. [2839. 98-2844. 98] The Michigan plant will help customers to make case by case production. [2844. 98-2847. 98] Then we will also make ourselves in California. [2847. 98-2850. 98] This part of the street lamp production. [2850. 98-2852. 98] All moved to Michigan for production.

[2852. 98-2855. 98] Then a small production line in California shuts down. [2855. 98-2857. 98] Lowers our California costs. [2857. 98-2860. 98] Increases Michigan's revenue. [2860. 98-2853. 98] It looks like something like this. [2863. 98-2855. 98] It looks like a good profit in Michigan. [2868. 98-2870. 98] It means that we look at the first quarter.

[2870. 98-2873. 98] It is near break even. [2873. 98-2875. 98] This is a big breakthrough. [2875. 98-2876. 98] The other is like. [2876. 98-2878. 98] Just the chairman said. [2878. 98-2880. 98] We multi-pronged operation at the same time. [2880. 98-2882. 98] There are some costs in the beginning.

[2882. 98-2884. 98] This restaurant is included. [2884. 98-2887. 98] We believe that after the opening of the restaurant in April. [2887. 98-2890. 98] will bring a great opportunity. [2890. 98-2893. 98] will be favored by consumers. [2893. 98-2898. 98] Yes.
