We welcome you to join KGI's online corporate meeting. Today's President and CEO are Mr. Chen Weijun and the investor relations team. Thank you very much. Let's start reporting now. We also have a fourth quarter of our financial performance last year in 2024.

First of all, let's look at the overall performance of our fourth quarter. In fact, we can see that the performance of each major division is brighter than the same period last year. In Taiwan, the performance of the cement is basically a relatively stable condition in the fourth quarter.

So, our business experience is also growing. Of course, there are some central banks in the fourth quarter, so the real estate policy is tighter. However, we also have some pre-ordering strategies that allow our gross profit margins to be improved only in the fourth quarter. In China cement business section, there is a clear reduction in production in the fourth quarter, which makes the price rebound a bit more significant than sales.

In the second half of the year, we actually had an additional contract, so we had a significant increase in our power generation capacity in the fourth quarter, so our fee profit went up. In addition to the one-stage fee period, because the gas price of the benefit of it is going down, a gross profit margin of the additional power is actually improving. In the far dragon stainless steel part, in the last year, we actually saw a demand for a downstream restocking, so in the fourth quarter, we also maintained a small case. In the rest of the investment sector, the part of the investment sector is also profitable.

The fourth quarter is usually a traditional low season, which is the case in the north. But there is a decrease in production, and then the price rebounds, which is the loss of the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is the loss of the whole year and also a convergence of losses. As for Far East Group's reinvestment of the new part of the Far East, he has some adjustments in the production industry.

So the fourth quarter of the profit is actually relatively good in terms of domain name. I saw the Asian part again, then Asia I just mentioned in the fourth quarter of the suspension of production, and then the price rebounded. In fact, it can be seen here that the sales of the cement part in the fourth quarter last year was 6.1 actually flat. But in the fourth quarter, there was no take-out hand, so the total amount of the cement handwork to add to the total is actually down.

The year-round decline was an eight percent decline compared to the year-round decline in demand in the country. In fact, the decline was a little less. The focus was that in the fourth quarter, there was a relatively large rebound in prices, which reversed the trend of falling last year. Therefore, the hair loss rate also improved.

However, this eh is a one-time factor. This is because we have identified a new asset value reduction in Hubei East and Wuhan East in the fourth quarter of last year. This part is about RMB 1.100 million. The impact of the conversion rate is about 18 pieces of money. So if we add 18 pieces of money back to the fourth quarter of the eh cement, the hair loss rate should actually be about 68.

This case is in progress. Therefore, this new production line in Hubei East and Wuhan East will begin to do part of the asset value reduction. It is expected that the other part will be listed after the entire replacement line is completed.

This is probably the case. In fact, other products also saw that the stock part actually grew significantly in terms of sales. Then, in the fourth quarter of last year, half of the stocks we sold were about 3.9 million tonnes throughout the year, selling nearly 10 million tonnes.

The gross profit margin of the stock has been slightly lower in recent years, but it is still about 50%. Therefore, it is actually better than the gross profit of the cement than before. This is also a part of the support or profit of the two cloud China, which has maintained relative to the decline in cement in recent years.

There are more than 200 million foreign trades here. Foreign exchange interest is more than 200 million. There are also more than 200 million foreign trades. Therefore, the addition of these pieces is actually a small contribution. In the business cost section to supplement the business cost section, the view is that there are 4 trillion million actually less than the same period last year.

There are a few other costs that are reloaded as well. That's the result. Please refer to this section of the balance sheet and the cash flow table below. If you are paying attention to what you see, please refer to it.

There are some changes in the ratio of cash and short throws, so it is mainly a different classification between fixed and living. So there is no particular reason why there is no such thing as too much. Then see below, the same thing as the comparison of the birth table in China is likely to be more variable than most other gains and losses. So in the 4th quarter, this figure is close to 200 million, which is more than the last year's agricultural period is mainly mentioned in this bad debt recharging and some other costs.

In fact, the conclusion of the two meeting is basically in line with market expectations. The growth of GDP is expected or 5% is that by expanding the financial stimulus to the underlying economy, the government's deficit rate should rise, so it shows the willingness to increase the bottom economy. Of course, the direction will also go in some scientific and technological fields or often in the direction, the local special debt is increasing, so in order to support the debt action.

However, the relative fact is that there are a lot of physical investment, so the current market view is that this year's water supply demand is basically or slow down in a direction. The supply chain can see that in the first quarter, the strength of the sales wind is significantly increased, and the price of mercury in the second quarter is actually more frequent, so it shows that the industry's consensus on the cease-fire price is relatively strong. From the briefing, you can see that it is like in the third column here is the first quarter of 2025, and the province of Sichuan Province in Jiangxi Province in the first quarter of 2025 actually has a lot more power than the previous quarter and the same period last year, so it shows that the impact level is higher than in previous years.

The main reason for this is that this is actually a relatively self-disciplined government, of course, but also a lack of mandatory means, so it becomes a relatively full variable. So this year's market is actually what we think or look forward to. But at least now in the first quarter of the beginning of the industry for the reduction of production and maintaining the price is relatively the case. So we also see a more self-disciplined situation in which the price of coal in the first quarter of the year is a good one.

That's why in the first quarter of this year, the outlook for this price is still a downward trend. We believe that our sales in the first quarter of this year is likely to be around 7%-8% of negative figures, which will be the same as the market's size. In the first quarter of this year, we believe that the downward trend is likely around 4 million tonnes, and that the price should be seen at the same time, because we just looked at the previous picture at the beginning of the month, so the price in the first quarter of this year has started to start some reversing.

It is expected that the target of new production to 2027 will increase to 30 million tons, namely Huanggang and Jiangxi, to add 10 million tons, which currently accounts for approximately 7% of shares. The gross profit ratio is about 30%. Therefore, if the allocation of stocks is increased by 30 percent, it is possible to achieve a product portfolio improvement. Then, to see the next part of Taiwan, the part of Taiwan currently looks like this from the fourth quarter of last year to September.

After the seventh wave of credit control, real estate's trading heat is strong. That's a downward trend. So we currently look at the building materials industry in the industry, and we expect that a demand for this year's growth should be slow.

For example, it looks like a carbon fee, which initially seems to be due to some industry discounts, so the impact is not very much, but in the future we will pay more attention to whether he will go higher. Another type of cement cargo tax war, whether it is continuous, this part has not been quite sure, because from the start of the second war, after tax deductions, it has continued to last at least three years. So this year, if inflation is slowing down, this tax increase may stop. But since it looks like February, Taiwan's inflation is going up, so this tax increase will not continue to continue.

It is expected that there will be some progress in July this year. If we determine that Taiwan is going to be anti-dumping in Vietnam, it will actually improve a supply and demand pattern here in Taiwan. This part is an observation of the experience. And see below, in terms of the flying water management business, this year may look like a flat or a small recession, because there is a major improvement in the first quarter of this year, and this part is four times, so it will affect the performance of boosting electricity in the first quarter.

The price of natural gas in the first two months of this year is also a slow climb, so this part of the rise in gas prices is actually a negative effect on our gross profit. So these factors can affect the performance of this year's increase. The second part is because there was an increase in the contract last year, so this first half of this year there is still such a positive impact on the basis period, so this is a positive effect. But by the second half of this year there is no such basis difference, so this year's increase may seem to be a moderate or a small recession, mainly due to the rise in overhaul and down gas prices.

In addition, in terms of stainless steel last year, we have seen some of the effects of stock replenishment, but that this situation does not actually see a significant continuation, so this year it looks like it would be a steady increase in stainless steel, but at least it does not lose a situation. Then take a look later, this part of our Yani and Aning China's capital expenditure, which is about 4 billion in terms of capital expenditure combined last year, but in fact, in the Yani China's part of the increase is actually to increase to 400 million, and that part of the increase is a progress of some of the previously described capacity replacement, and then there is some improvement in environmental protection, so we expect that part of the Yani China's capital expenditure will be going up in the next few years.

The above is a brief report of the results of 2024 today. Then we will enter the Q&A section, please let me know if you have any questions and we will reply together in the chat room. Thank you.

But this is part of it. In fact, there are still challenges in the future. Just to show you that the demand side is not obvious to drive, so coupled with the discontinuation of production is actually a relatively self-disciplined behavior that does not have some mandatory laws. In the past, we have also experienced the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of the failure of production, only now is in a stage of a relatively strong consensus of the failure of the shutdown, so it is difficult to guarantee that the future will be some changes in the future, so the variables still exist, but the current situation looks good before the first quarter of the current situation is good, how to see the demand of the pull at least cement demand, statistics should go up. This is the reason why I am just saying that the price can now be restored mainly because the supply chain is shrinking, and the execution of one of the parties is blocked, because the current demand direction looks like this year or down is likely to be only a year ago, so the key is to say that there is a need for order and demand for supply may be seen whether or not there is a large investment policy released in the second quarter of 2024, which is currently higher than last year. If the price is stable or even higher in the first half of March, I think the performance of the first half of this year should be at least reverse a situation that can not be maintained until the end of this year.

2026 or 2027. It should be completed, so this year should not be the next year. The following question is similar to the previous one. At least the first quarter or the first half of the first half should look better than last year, and the second half is less uncertain.

The following question is whether or not the recent decline in the stock market has been so strict implementation. This question is very good, we are not sure, because at least in the first quarter of this year, many places have proposed more than a number of production days than last year. For example, you seem to think that a quarter of Sichuan 60 days more than last year 10 days, and Jiangxi 10 days more than last year, but also 25 days more than last year.

So it would be a good idea to see the price rebound. If there is a demand coming up in the second quarter, then there is a slight rewind of demand after the second quarter. Of course, there may be no need to stop for so many days, so basically it is wrong that it is produced for adjustment. So it is unlikely that the demand is good and then everyone is still parked wrong, which is less likely to happen.

That's because the demand for discontinued products will be in stock and digestible. But if there is a more obvious pick-up in April, then of course, it may not stop for a few days as an erroneous stopover adjustment mechanism. The following question is whether 2025 is not just because there is a great relationship. So it will stop the cost of a month will also increase, and the gas price will also go up.

This is the first step in the process of making a profit this year. It is the first step in the process of making a profit. The first step is to make a profit from the process of making a profit from it. The first step is to make a profit from it. The second step is to make a profit from it. The second step is to make a profit from it. The second step is to make a profit from it. The second step is to make a profit from it.

In fact, this variable also looks at how this year's anti-dumping will happen in Vietnam. There is a release that may be a bit better in this part, but the pre-arranged part is because it is a relatively local industry. So over the years it will be driven by one of the real estate and then industrial manufacturing companies, such as TSMC.

This is because the import part of this or a variable, but the pre-preparation part seems to be still in the positive improvement. That is, although the demand may not be too much of a change because the room can be more or less or some effect. That is, the increase in value may still be in the pre-preparation part at least one is still in progress. So this year I think it should be a relatively stable but positive view.

Building a house. That's why Taiwan's low season is not obvious all year round. So the second quarter now looks like I should not be too different from the first quarter.

The demand is a more neutral view. Because real estate is heating up now. At least, it is a downward decline in trading volume. The natural builder is likely to be more forgettable on the ongoing push of this piece.

So, at least in terms of policy, it is now relatively empty. Frankly speaking, this is the case. But because the demand for housing in Taiwan is rigid or because of the whole technology, etc., and then there are some old houses to replace the demand for new homes, the demand for rigidity is structurally problematic.

Therefore, it is not possible to be closed to where the demand for rigid demand or the same cooling may be due to the fact that there is no consensus between the buyer and seller of the part of the price. In such a case, the builder's point of view is that he does not want to continue to build the housing proposal, he may actually have a slightly more optimistic view. Because if the situation is decommissioned now, it may not be good.

So, if the cold plate is kept for a long time then it is likely that the demand will start to slow down some time in the coming years. But then it should look more stable this year. The Chinese demand just shows that the second season looks a little bit better, but in fact, I think this is a little lower than last year.

The condition of mountain and mountain landscapes. There is no mountain and mountain landscape conditions in the past year is more normal. Frankly speaking, because 4Q23 is a relatively large loss, because he has some impairments, so the loss of so much last year is not entirely attributable to the business.

So it is likely that he was discontinued in the middle of November, so in the fourth quarter, he was still operating for at least a month and a half. Then this part is actually going to cover his December retrospective. Other questions. Well, I don't know the health bootstrap investor you asked us to add a new question. Then there is an investor who asks if we have some funds for him. Then it's China-related stock, and finally it's our strategic investment.

So this part of the investment is not easy for us to explain. So we are our strategic investment. So we do not know if there are any advanced investment problems to ask. So if you have no further questions about investing, then our Asian cement online legal statement will be here. So we thank Ninus again so thank you for your participation.

Then pray.
