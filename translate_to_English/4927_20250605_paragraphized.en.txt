The quarter is 1.8% positive growth. That is a positive growth compared to the same period last year.

The labor rate in the first quarter was 4.8%. There was a noticeable pick-up compared to the previous quarter. This was mainly due to a improvement in manufacturing costs.

The organization adjusts the relationship with some flattening measures. In the fourth quarter, it can be seen that the outside part has a relatively large loss.

This is because it is done in advance. There is some deterioration of the loss of some idle equipment. This is followed if it is followed. If it goes back to profit, it can be re-compiled again.
