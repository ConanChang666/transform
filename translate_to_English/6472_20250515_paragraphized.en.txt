Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: 2028 This place is very old and a tired company, and we want to use these technologies here to make sure there is not enough space for the CDMO. We want to use these technologies here to make sure that the CDMO does not have enough space. This is what we want to make sure that we are preparing CDMO technology.

This is our key theory in this company. Finally, we want to adjust the functions of high-tech. We want to adjust the functions of high-tech. We talk about MAPERGROW, NASAL STERIL, high-performance APIs, high-performance drugs, and different different different differences that are not suitable in the company.

In addition, we actually want to zing in order to understand the forest hurt culture of Duluth. This product is very Advance, they seem to have a high value for Trump residents and the United States, and we are also looking forward to the challenge of making a lot of cash and resources from the fish in 2021, and in the end, the internal risk of the company is decided to enjoy two million. We introduce them for years. Their small Mr. er. Porrer de None, and this is also the ville financer who has promoted nearly all of the global enterprise-owned home Variant financer to Ctô uly support sprechen, I don't know all of the cleaningser oscillarre, we will provide our shareholders with annuance of our actions for this year's two and a half-and-and-and-half-and-and-and-a-a-a-and-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

So we continue to work on our M&A strategy, which will only increase the lack of competitiveness in China's M&A areas, including between South America and Europe. On the right, we want to show our internal analysis, including the current financial impact and possible impact. We hope that by 20% to 30% of our financial impact, we will see that our financial impact is reduced from 0.5% to 1.5%. So we see an impact, but our team is working hard.

So it is time for us to comply and make further progress. But I strongly say that we have invested more than 200 billion yuan in the United States over the three-year period. So we have made progress. We know that Trump will have these financial impacts, but we know that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that we need to make supply chains close to our customers and close to patients. So we listen to our customer statement that we have worked very hard to set up manufacturing drugs for our customers and patients in the United States, and this is true that in the case of the United States we have also made progress in our case, including in Taiwan and the United States, and we will make further progress, including in the case of Taiwan and the United States, including in the case of our production of NOAB trophic or the production of the NOAB overflow is required.

So we now have a certain idea. So this Ya took or to deal with China's foreign authorities' frequent bids premier My day-to-day with India lol strategy good news that some of the Acoris in China can go back to chapter 1 We call DECAT at a global meeting in New York We got three awards, but our first prize is the best CDMO award in the business so it's a we continue to show our values We'll continue to show our values in the world CDMO We're going to do these events next in 2025 and 2026.

We will continue to produce in Mississauga this is our Canadian company we also see in the industry there are growing demand so this is what we want to emphasize that we do not see our company in our space our expertise is very difficult to transfer, so I think it is a very strong line you will have a strong message in our profession it is difficult to transfer existing products from a company in the U.S. So I think we have a lot of our customers, especially a lot of us, and we are going to continue to talk about a very long supply mix of new facilities in the U.S.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the verbatim text from the user, and convert it from the verbatim format to the paragraph. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the structure.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript and understand the overall content and structure. It looks like a report about business progress and ESG, which may involve financial data, market expansion, policy impact, etc. There are some duplicate or non-continuous parts of the middle, such as "I think it's in in incubation," which I think is incubated, and this may need to be preserved, but may need to adjust the paragraphs to make it more coherent. Next, I need to identify the corresponding sentences for each timestamp and group them logically. For example, the sections of Vigify and Vigabitron may belong to the same paragraph, discussing financial results and market expansion.

It is important to note that some sentences may be duplicated or incomplete, such as "수", "Spoken", "King", "Master", etc., these may be garbled or speech recognition errors, but the user requests do not have to be deleted, so it must be retained. Similarly, spelling errors such as "Mortal tú" also need to be retained as well. During the processing process, I will check the sentence repeatedly to make sure that nothing is missing.

“Starting with 20% investment rate and MIS-CI ESG rate A, this information needs to be organized consistently. There may be some non-continuous sentences in the middle, such as “we are manual,” but must be retained. The Q&A section, user questions and answers need to be segmented to ensure that each question and response is clear. For example, regarding the impact of Trump's policy on CDMO, Bobby's responses need to be segmented to keep the original order and content.

We continue to invest in Vigify and we see good results. On the right side of the focus point, if you can put your video here. Basically, the earnings of Vigabitron stocks increase new doctor market income, so in the four quarters, 60% of doctor market earnings increase new doctor market income, so now, in the four quarters, many hospitals have the latest Vigabitron persuade which Potter, 수 is king, us in this quarter and last quarter income, new patients become drug income in the second half of the year.

Our investments in the past few months have also definitely increased Q1 and 2025 revenues. We have increased our revenues in the previous quarter by 114%. We are excited that over 400 new patients have entered VIGFYD's treatment during this quarter. This means that our growth and growth is very important, and we will continue to carry out the early stages of the drug.

About Bora, we are in the community and we absolutely respect ESG. We believe that as a global company, we must be a global burden, and for example. At TSWSE, TWSE, we will be in the burden of the country and in the region, our investment rate is 20% of the listed companies that prove our lack of execution, so we will definitely continue to improve our management within the company. Our MIS-CI ESG rate is A, and we will definitely increase our execution rate in the next half time.

Zero attention, no attention, no attention, no attention, this is a very high success, the world's latest successful CDMO company. Next time. Thank you all for your time. We hope that we have time to carry out the Q&A. Thank you.

We will go back to the first minute of the question you have asked. We have a question from our host. First, how is Trump's policy possible to control drug abuse? Questions between the CDMO and the chemical business.

I think that's really a problem. First of all, I would like to say that the President's order is Trump and the government's assertion. This action requires a lot of processing, and there are many changes that we will do. But in terms of CDMO, we actually see that we expect more benefits, rather than a greater impact.

Their prices are very firm, so they don't have any problems. I think, as I said, we're going to go through a long process and we'll see that we're going through a long process. We've also heard that they only focus on Medicaid, while they focus only on 100% products. So, better or better, those 100% products aren't on the CDMO.

We will look at where the price will go beyond Medicaid. In addition, we are also paying attention to the value of a variety of medicines around the world. Many of our products on CDMO are the only products in the United States. Many products are OTC products, that is, they are not the protective agent of the drug, but rather the drug used. So, I think we have a good mix of effects that we will see, although we may not see the impact, but we have not seen it yet. So, I will give you another location where we are looking at the CDMO business.

I think the CDMO will be beneficial because the government is currently trying to make the U.S. pharmaceutical companies more efficient. I think that effectiveness is beneficial for the business of CDMO. I think that there will be more output, more discussion about output products, more products, because pharmaceutical companies try to maintain production budgets and maintain production budgets, a lot of budgets can be obtained by the pharmaceutical companies, through the output of some products.

But this is just a small part of what we are currently doing, and if there is any impact, we will not say we are 100% in the field, we are a patient with a diseased drug, we do not see the price policy, affect the disease and diseased drugs. So we are convinced that in this respect, but we have been observing, we can, we can, we can take different choices, especially in terms of our supply chain and price reductions, we are doing these things. So at the moment, we are very cautious, we are very careful, we are very cautious, we are very cautious about the current price of the drug, and our CVMO business and our business, again, we are in the classic aspects, as you see, President Trump's executive order does not mention the classic business, so we want to see how the government's view is a classic business, because it is a low price supplier, so it may be the current discussion of the current President's executive order and the reduced price. We have several more questions about our operations, first of all about the purchase, and now we are looking at what the company is looking at, whether the company is willing to continue, in 2025, we are still very full of confidence in the entire CMO industry, we think it is a high-growth industry, we think that every action that takes place in the United States, every Trump action will benefit BORA, will also benefit the CMO industry, in the United States, because of any pressure, in the price, or in the market, will benefit the CMO industry, because of any pressure, in the price, or the company's production, will focus on business, market, product and identification, these features, in the company, will make the company more efficient, so I think, from the point of M&A, from the perspective, we see a lot of opportunities in the CMO industry, we have, there, we have a lot, so we can never get, so I think, because we are, because we are, because we do not, because we do not have, because we do not have, because of the future, because we do not have to buy, because because we do not obvious, because we think, because, because we will be, because we will be, we want, we want, we want, we want, we want to buy it, we want, we will be, we want, we want, we want, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be,

Goods, goods, there are many, easy to describe, there are 1-2 sites, there are 9-10 sites on the web. Many customers are signed, many businesses, many development projects. It takes 30-60 days to go live, the development is about 18 months to 2 months. Commercial procedures are, of course, ongoing, for many years.

The market is not sure about the impact of the ongoing industry in the first quarter. Why Boro does not provide early warning. The second question is whether there is any significant impact, or if there is a possibility of a failure in the second quarter.

The market closure has its value, and we need to understand these values. When we close, we should not give any indications to the value of the closure, especially in this regard. This is only part of a large market, and we do not need to provide any indications to the value of the closure, especially in this regard. We do not need to provide any indications to the value of the closure, so this is not a company closure, this is not a company closure, this is a market we buy, we buy, this is a market we buy, this is the closure of the goods we buy.

So we don't need or have that ability, we just published the information, I hope that the market and shareholders can feel that we can react to this situation. I think this may be for us, at least inside, I'm very grateful to our team and our ability to prove that the market is difficult to predict, and to see that the main guidance is not procrastination guidance. The main guidance is, hey, in the future, these market costs will increase, and we are not delaying, it is simple, the city, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, some market forecasts, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the market forecast, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the future, it's, it's, it's the future, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the market, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
