Changrong Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.'s corporate briefing session began. We welcome you to join us as a VIP, as the leader of Changrong Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.'s corporate briefing session. We would like to introduce you to the management team involved today.

First of all, we would like to invite Mr. Lin, Chairman of the Board of Directors. Thank you for your continued investment. We would like to thank you for your continued support.

We are here to help. Please ask our General Manager for the company's first quarter of 114 and outlook for the future. We will make a briefing with you. Thank you.

Thank you again and thank you for coming to our legal meeting today. That's why I'm here to report it to everyone.

First of all, this is our disclaimer for you to refer to. I think that today's report includes some of the following.

First, I would like to report our main business is the operational profile of the company itself and the development of the industry. Then, I will explain the operation profile of the company and the development of the industry. Then, I will report the consolidated financial profile of the first quarter of this year. That will explain the sustainability and green energy policy.

We just bought two factories. It has a new silver factory. It is well with the Hsinchu factory. The new factory covers an area of about 58000 square feet. Then the Hsinchu factory covers an area of about 15000 square feet.

There are two kinds of people: those who are righteous, those who are righteous, those who are righteous, those who are righteous, and those who are righteous.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read through the user's requirements to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

First of all, I will check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp in a row to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, in the beginning part of the reference "that total is more than 15,000 019 tons is the newly purchased part", here may need to confirm whether the number is correct, but the user requests not to modify the content, so the direct retention. Then, I need to organize the contents of these sentences in logical order into paragraphs. For example, about the Shining part, from the proportion of investment to the business description, to the operational data and future prospects, should be arranged consistently together.

For example, in the Rongding Green Energy section, it is necessary to mention multiple times the amount of electricity and the amount of electricity generated by the "deficient digestion", which needs to be fully presented. During the processing process, also pay attention to the corresponding timestamps, to ensure that the time range of each paragraph is correct. For example, the operation data and future outlook distribution of Rongding Green Energy in different timestamps need to be properly classified into the corresponding paragraphs. Finally, check whether the whole paragraph type of text is smooth, whether it meets the requirements of the user, without missing anything, and maintains the original structure and information.

After completing these steps, read again to make sure that all sentences are correctly arranged without omissions or errors, while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the original text. This generates paragraph-based transcription that meets the user's requirements. </think>

The business we are going to invest in includes the first Xin Rong, that he is neutral, that he is mainly dealing with household waste, and a generation of electricity generated after the domestic waste disposal, and then, of course, the part of the waste that he can collect from our company's investment accounted for about 72. 36%. The second invested company is hydro and aesthetic engineering, that his main business is dealing with hazardous waste or medical waste, and that our company's investment in Taoyuan Guanyin is 48. 13%. Then the last one is Rong Green Energy, that he is mainly dealing with a household waste in Taoyuan, as well as the general industrial waste generated, so we are more special that he is also helping the Taoyuan government to deal with some of his food waste, then digests, then sells electricity, and that our investment is 50. 06%.

I think because the first two years from 2022 to last year, we are actually doing the work of rectification, so we can see that the first quarter of this year's entry volume is 10745, that the processing volume is 102446 tons, which is obviously the average of the first two years, because the first two years are in the rectification phase, then he is still higher than 2022, because his equipment is getting older in 2022, I think that this is the purpose of our rectification, his performance improved later, and he will also be able to meet the latest environmental requirements. This is our first quarter of the year of rectification, compared to the first three years of his electricity generation, and then the same, the first quarter of this year is clearly better than the average of the three years, this, or the entire performance he just mentioned after the rectification, can really see his growth.

This is why I want to look forward to the future of the water and beauty of the future, because in fact, I want to report to you, in fact, the domestic competition is getting more and more intense in the part of the harmful waste, so his price is actually going down, his treatment price is going to fall, so our strategy before that is to give him a lot of self-driving, we hope to increase his amount to fill this difference, the price is not bad, so his profit can continue to be stable. At present, I have reported that he has been split into two of his operating documents on April 9, so now, in this time, according to the Taoyuan Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau's fixed source of pollution license, that has passed the administrative process, should be expected at the end of May, I want to report to you.

I think that part of this is the nature of a contractual obligation, that is, how much we deal with the interaction of the city. That is a statement of how much we do with the operation of a few environmental subsidiaries. That is a statement of the development of the industry. That is a statement of the financial profile of the operation of a few environmental subsidiaries, which is a comparison of our consolidated revenues and losses in the first quarter of this year. The first quarter of this year, I think we are 3.88227 million, then our consolidated business experience is 7.82928 million, then the combined revenue and profits in the second quarter of this year, which belongs to the parent company's experience is $62.444,000 million, then our first quarter EPS is 1.49. I would like to report to you how much this combined revenue is greater than the first quarter of the previous three years, and then the first quarter EPS is 1.49, which can be said to be a new high of the year.

In the first quarter of this year, I want to focus on the first quarter of the parent company is a special steel part, our first quarter of our revenue is 2.9 billion 7189 million, then our subsidiary to invest in the second quarter is about 76. 55%, then here to talk about the share of the parent company's share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the first quarter of the first quarter of the first quarter of this year is about 68. 6%, this table is also for reference. The first quarter of the year compared to the first quarter of the first quarter of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the first year, I want of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of share of the share of the share of the share of share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the first year, and then we

We will then implement the health policy of occupational safety in response to social feedback, we hope to achieve zero-value disasters as the goal, and then we actively participate in a variety of public welfare activities, including supporting the domestic arts and culture, caring local communities, or education and rural medical care, to achieve corporate social responsibility. Of course, in order to maintain the physical and mental health of our employees, we continue to carry out health checks that are superior to the regulatory frequency and bureau, and hold regular health talks and educational advocacy.

The solar heating photovoltaic system in addition to the previously outsourced rental, whether it is a new lease of 1722kW and a new operation of 499.8kW, then the total set-up we completed before 2024 was 2547. 21kW, which is a bit different from last year's reports, the difference of 0.25 is a little more than the previous, which is because the solar heating we said when the final inspection of the power delivery itself is so, and this year we expect will continue to do so.

That's what I'm working on at 160kW. That's part of my presentation. Thank you, General Manager.

And the hour is coming, and the time of the Lord is at hand, and the time of the Lord is at hand; and the time of the Lord is at hand, and the time of the Lord is at hand; and the time of the Lord is at hand.

That's what this guest came up with first. Please state what you expected to buy in 114 years. And environmental business revenues. And profit. I'd like to ask you about this. We're the general manager to explain.

Thank you, I think I've done this in 113 years, it's last year.

Our lifting volume is more than 123,000 tons. In fact, last year we estimated that the actual data was higher than this. But because of this industry, we talk about it. The owner himself has his own changes.

His progress. It will be delayed later. So we finished more than 123,000 tonnes last year. That is equivalent to many downshorers who have been delayed to this year. That is.

As far as I can tell, we have already reported on orders that are in our hands right now. It should be 23 million. More than 5000 tonnes. That's what we're talking about. This year, 114-year shipments should be able to maintain a certain level.

This is the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest, and the year of the Lord of the harvest.

Of course, I think the cost of funding is likely to be high.

In fact, I have reported on the last legislative session that the gross profit margin was about 7 to 10 or 11 percent. In fact, because of China-US trade, and the pandemic we have been talking about over the past few years, the result is a very unexpected result is that we just bought so many years, and we have so high gross profit margins. The third time I have resisted you to say how long this can last, I think this is going to look at the economic situation behind the whole economy, or now the government's so-called housing policy will not lead to the whole housing push, of course we will continue to do an observation. Of course, we hope that we can say that the times of high gross profit, and then even if we do not select orders carefully, we will maintain a certain profit.

This is the first time that we have received an estimate of the cash dividends we expect to distribute in the year 114. We have received an estimate of the cash dividends we expect to receive in the year 114. The question is to explain the impact of this tariff policy on the company and the industry in the year 114. I would like to make a statement about this issue, thank you. I think the most concern now is that we have to explain the same tariff uncertainty, in fact, if we say the same tariff decision in the long run, may be I think a lot of things will reply to the normal, because I think the economic activities of life will actually go on.

I think I'm going to start by saying that whether we're just buying our business or investing in environmental protection, this is an internal industry, and I think tariffs are not going to hit us directly, and we don't have a direct relationship with us. Then, of course, the overall impact on our long-term impact on how we will talk about it, and we really don't see it right now. Then, I think we're going to be afraid that we won't be profiting from the pandemic, and that's not the result, but it's going to improve, so we don't know what we're going to do in the future. But of course, we're going to think that this long-term impact on the economy is continuing observation, and then we're going to react.

What are the major competitors in the market for aquatic beauty? What is the impact on aquatic beauty? That's the question I asked her to explain. The degradation of industrial waste is now in line with the policy of the circular economy, so the amount of waste dispersion has been reduced, and the price is still a bit down under the competition in the inter-hand treatment field.

We have a lot of experience in both life and hazardous waste, so we have a lot of experience in this regard. So now because of the domestic language, I am now, whether it is in the north and south of the country, this culture milk is about 20 years, so now may start from Taichung, from Tainan, Taiwan, Taichung, or Taipei, there may be the government to launch these BOT cases to do the ROT case, of course, our company's statement is whether we work alone with these consulting companies to bid, or with other companies to bid together, the most important thing is that we have to tell all of our shareholders that the whole situation is the situation.

What is it? So if there is this opportunity, I think we are all going to participate. Of course, if there is this conclusion, I will also report with you. Then there is a part of the circular economy. Of course, like our dragontops, he has a center of life and death.

It may be like, all these animals, excretions of animals, like pigs, chickens, or cows, his excretions. And that is, of course, mainly some food waste. The main part of that is, of course, at the moment, the use of electricity, electricity, to do one treatment. This is probably because it is a more dangerous measure, so it may be that by the government, to do a public, a brief explanation, so that all people can understand that the government's mind is that they want these wastes, not to go, pollute to, the whole, rivers, or farmland.

And of course, there may be a proposal in the early days, but we think that the proposal is relatively low, and we may not go to the case. In addition, of course, this is about these, fruit trees, or these rice dried, even we are abroad, we also with Japan, in the discussion of these, that is, the palm tree is old, he did wood particles, which is flying to Japan. So we have all been researching about these entire circular economy, so we have to wait until that is really mature this report is good, so we have to target it, maybe, we will do a report with you.

We would like to thank you for your continued support and wish you all the best.
