Welcome to this online conference. We will ask the Chief Secretary of Homeland to give us a briefing. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Weng.

We have a limited time now. Let's get into chapter one first. That's the basic introduction of the company. That's what I mean by this investment friend should all be familiar with our company.

There are currently 26 distributions. The main thing to show here is that we have the largest niche in our country. Because there are many factories that can work together and have the ability to dispatch. So we can work with a large number of simultaneous synchronisation of customers in a short period of time. That was our operating performance in the first quarter of this year. The revenue we saw in the first quarter was 53.54 billion.

In the first quarter of that year, we saw revenue of 53.54 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, a decline of 56.98 billion compared to the fourth quarter of last year was a decline. That was 51.49 million compared to the first quarter of the same period last year was 4% growth.

Last year's fourth quarter was 4.7 billion, a decline of 7.5%. That was the first quarter of last year's 3.37 billion, a growth of 2.2%. The profit-seeing portion was 11.06 this year's first quarter. Last year's 1.2 billion declined by 7.8%. The first quarter of that year's first quarter was 11.05 billion. A slight increase of 0.1 percent.

The net income of that tax right was 11.07 billion in the first quarter of this year. That was 11.33 last year. That was over 0.3% growth in the first quarter of last year. The net income of that tax after that was $8.67 billion in the first quarter of this year. The 92.25 billion fell by 6.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. That was 1.4% in the fourth quarter of last year.

That belongs to the parent company was 8.37 in the first quarter of this year. That EPS was 0.71 in the fourth quarter of last year. It was a decline of 11.8% in the first quarter of last year. It was a decline of 11.8% in the second quarter of last year.

That first quarter of the same period last year fell by 11.8%. That same quarter of the same period last year fell by 11.8%. That same quarter of the same period last year fell by 11.8%. The U.S. masturbation rose by 1.4%. We look at the gross profit margin below. The gross profit margin for the first quarter of this year was 25.51.

It was a slight decline compared to last year's 25.9. Then, compared to the first quarter of last year's 24.92 ratio, which was 20. 66%. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year's fourth quarter and the fourth quarter of last year's fourth quarter.

Compared to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of the year. That is a slight decline. The last part of the Goldfield was 16. 19% this year. It was 16. 23% compared to the fourth quarter of the year. This is also a slight decline compared to the first quarter of the year.

Because we are talking about the fourth quarter. Because our industry has been said. It is usually the lightest season. Because it is the year of the year, so the number of working days is less.

Compared to the fourth quarter, the performance is relatively poor. That is the same as the first quarter of the same year. On the contrary, there will be growth. This is because the main revenue has increased by 4%. But the gross profit has only grown by 2.2%. That is mainly because of our costs.

There is a slight increase in the cost of waterming. There is also a new factory in our people factory. There is a start to increase from last year's July. So these costs are relative. There are some personnel costs increase and so on. So that leads to the growth of our costs.

The revenue growth is greater than the revenue growth. So Maori slightly increased a little. That part of the business benefit is also. The cost part is mainly due to the cost of wages. There are also some expenses for research and development.

So we just keep a little bit of growth. Then let's look at some of the important indicators related to the number of assets represented. Here we can see the company's cash and the investment of valuable documents. 60.17 billion.

Revenue accounts 72.5.8 billion. Compared to the same period last year or at the end of the year. Revenue accounts are pretty much the same. A little more. So we can see the total value of this asset.

That's real estate factory equipment. Now the first quarter reached 186 million. The same period last year, 177 million. The same year, compared to the same period last year, 1441 million.

The total value of the remaining assets is 453.82 million. The current liquidity portion is currently 64.36 billion. The total amount of the flying dragon cave is about 101.6 billion. The total amount of the liabilities is 166 billion.

The current net value for the first quarter is 23.42 million. The current liquidity ratio is 217.4.2 billion. 217. 7% of the debt ratio remains at 36.6. Next, let's talk about the future of our company.

So let's talk about our company. That second part is looking forward to this year's talk. The lower cost gain is the main focus. Then come together in this AI smart factory. Low carbon sustainability. TAF experimental certification.

The current hand-held order visibility is still more than 16 months. Therefore, it is still stable growth. The company may have a potential advantage for a longer-term future. The first Nangang main building. The second point is to follow the outlook. Taichung plant is implementing AI 4. 0 system.

We expect to reduce raw materials loss. The third point is our Taiwan.

[634. 60-636. 60] It just goes to green concrete. [636. 60-641. 60] Basically, the sales of our products must go up. [641. 60-642. 60] Thank you very much. [654. 60-6664. 60] mo≈ºemy is close to getting inside? [664. 60-669. 60] zeka caricature redirects [669. 60-674. 60] $870 kicks off [674. 60-675. 60] Hey.

[675. 60-679. 60] The current lot quantity is about 8 million. [679. 60-682. 60] Good thank you. [682. 60-686. 32] The second quarter of the concrete cost increase compared to the first quarter? [686. 32-688. 82] The current lot quantity. [690. 82-694. 64] The lot quantity has already been answered about 8 million.

[695. 14-700. 52] Do you say that the cost of the second quarter will go up? [701. 28-703. 34] The trend that is currently looking up. [703. 34-713. 84] Is it a little bit up, but the magnitude should not be too big. [717. 94-718. 96] Thanks for your cooperation. [733. 34-739. 48] Does the gross profit of Q2 decrease slightly?

Because you look at us now. [739. 74-744. 34] The April revenue announced reached about 20.100 million. [744. 60-748. 18] That's because we're talking about the same time last year. [749. 22-752. 02] That's probably the sales volume of April. [753. 82-755. 86] Much better than the same time last year. [759. 20-763. 30] The gross profit margin compared to the first quarter may also be increased.

[773. 54-764. 62] So basically. [765. 14-769. 74] It should not fall because the production of our second quarter is usually larger. [770. 26-775. 12] So the relative cost of manufacturing costs is a bit cheaper than labor costs. [775. 62-778. 70] So basically it will be higher than the first quarter. [778. 96-783. 06] Unless you say the second quarter is suddenly not raining or there is a lot of rain in the second quarter. [783. 30-785. 10] It is usually better than the first quarter.

[793. 54-797. 94] So if I were to say no. [798. 16-802. 96] JA [807. 12-807. 16] casually said. [814. 52-826. 92] awards [820. 14-821. 56] ervi [823. 34-832. 40] New year's shipping target is about 620 million squares. [853. 34-858. 96] The main rainy day, of course, is that when it rains, we can't do it. [858. 96-863. 52] So the impact of the rain is mainly due to the general concrete characteristics. [863. 52-867. 32] So it's basically heavy rain and I can't do it.

[867. 32-868. 84] That's all. [868. 84-874. 26] Another question you're saying is that Q3Q4 is not the trend. [874. 26-877. 36] is the same as before. [877. 36-882. 58] theoretically, this weather factor is the same as this cycle. [882. 58-883. 34] It's basically the same. [883. 34-889. 04] Because we already have a lot of manual orders for one year.

[889. 04-893. 42] Just to say that the weather can match us. [893. 42-894. 96] That's what we're talking about in our first quarter. [894. 96-899. 50] This year's first quarter comparison is especially because it's actually after the end of the year. [899. 50-902. 16] It may be too late for everyone to start working. [902. 16-905. 48] So Mao's first quarter is not so prominent. [907. 50-910. 04] That's the current normal practice.

[910. 04-912. 72] The weather should be getting better and better. [913. 34-921. 38] Understand. [921. 38-923. 60] denn [923. 60-923. 84] rapid [923. 84-930. 46] CQ1 domestic general concrete encounters With the Q1 we are here one hundred thousand ground soil. [930. 46-933. 36] The average price is about 3190. [933. 36-939. 42] to the second quarter part. [939. 42-939. 54] debt 54-942. 20 because it is only a month old.

[943. 20-947. 64] The current word should be about 320 billion. [957. 34-962. 06] Then we just said that we have no plan to dispose of land this year, etc. [962. 06-965. 24] This we have always been in the nationalization of assets. [965. 24-968. 44] And then there was always the seeking of buyers. [968. 44-972. 64] But it would not be seen by all. [973. 20-976. 40] Can not be traded.

[976. 40-980. 76] Not that we can decide, but we are actively working on it. [991. 30-996. 30] The structure of the revenue is actually the same as our current trend. [996. 30-999. 36] It is about 11% in public works. [999. 36-1001. 56] The factory is about 12%. [1001. 56-1003. 16] The technology plant is 12%. [1003. 16-1006. 92] Then the building part is about 66%.

[1006. 92-1010. 06] The day after that is 8%. [1010. 06-1013. 92] The current structure is almost the same. [1023. 16-1013. 16] Hello gift is bad. [1024. 16-1026. 56] I want to quickly ask a question. [1026. 56-1033. 16] I want to see you build the first AI Smart Concrete Plant in Taichung, Taiwan. [1033. 16-1043. 16] If you want to give a brief introduction to what you used to be like, this is what the traditional factory is different.

[1043. 16-1047. 16] Because we currently have the traditional feed. [1047. 16-1051. 16] Because we know that the general clay is actually the main thing is to put the sand. [1051 16-1054. 16] Pharmaceuticals ash-fi Hearthstone these materials. [1054. 16-1057. 16] Have their own funnels to put it directly. [1057. 16-1060. 16] Manually control it. [1060. 16-1063. 16] So how much to put in.

[1063. 16-1067. 16] The so-called AI system is directly usable. [1067. 16-1069. 16] In that. [1069. 16-1072. 16] The device inside the sink is fitted with the monitoring device. [1072. 16-1076. 16] It can be more precise how much I might invest. [1076. 16-1086. 16] This monitoring device can be more precise. [1080. 16-1086. 16] It is not necessary to use visual or traditional machines to make such operations.

[1086. 16-1092. 16] So the raw materials that can be more precisely put are not too much waste. [1093. 16-1095. 16] So use a very precise device. [1095. 16-1098. 16] You may use a very precise device. [1098. 16-1109. 16] This is the one. [1100. 16-1102. 16] This one. [1102. 16-1104. 16]

[1104. 16-1106. 16] This. [1106. 16-1108. 16] This. [1108. 16-1110. 16] This. [1110. 16-1112. 16] This. [1112. 16-1114. 16] This. [1114. 16-1116. 16] This.

[1116. 16-1118. 16] This. [1118. 16-1120. 16] This. [1120. 16-1122. 16] This. [1123. 16-1132. 16] He also didn't ask that we expect that the second quarter of this year will not be able to produce gross profit. [1132. 16-1144. 16] The same period last year. [1144. 16-1151. 16] Speaking of gross profit rates can't be guaranteed to be high.

[1151. 16-1152. 16] will be high. [1152. 16-1154. 76] will be high or low. [1154. 76-1157. 02] We can only say. [1157. 02-1158. 16] Amounts. [1158. 16-1161. 30] The amount of consumer blindness must be higher than last year. [1161. 30-1166. 06] Because of last year.

[1166. 06-1168. 36] The past is the sales volume of April. [1168. 36-1170. 62] Only about 49 million squares. [1170. 62-1172. 96] The part of our April is. [1172. 96-1175. 82] This April, this year reached 52 million squares. [1175. 82-1178. 22] So the volume is clearly proportional to the amount. [1178. 22-1180. 16] Last April was still higher.

[1180. 16-1185. 10] The unit price is also higher than last year's April. [1185. 10-1187. 56] So basically. [1187. 56-1191. 22] Blindness is likely to be higher than the same period last year. [1191. 22-1195. 82] Unless it says 5 or June rains or anything. [1195. 82-1197. 40] Otherwise, [1197. 40-1200. 06] should be better.

[1210. 16-1213. 40] If there has been a rainstorm before. [1213. 40-1214. 36] is better. [1214. 36-1216. 20] If there is a lot of material kits. [1216. 20-1218. 32] Or there is JK op filter. [1218. 32-1219. 20]

[1221. 26-1222. 52] Because Liaoren trees. [1222. 52-1233. 32] did not achieve the infrastructure. [1237. 38-1237. 98] Yes. [1237. 98-1239. 22] Last year.
