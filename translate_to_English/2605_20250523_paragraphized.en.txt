Hello friends. Welcome to join the emerging industry. I am the Vice President. I am Mr. Hui Zhihong.

It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to meet you today. Today's briefings will be shared with you first. The company's results in the first quarter of the year. We will then share with you.

The outlook for the future market, and the company's strategy. Next, we will explain to you the financial highlights of the first quarter of 2025.

First quarter income. NT$9.46 billion. Reduced compared to the previous quarter. Mainly because of the bulk market. Low rent. Especially the Strait type and super large iron ore sand boat.

The first quarter of the US stock earnings portion is $0.02. It is also less than the fourth quarter of last year. The main difference is the decrease in rent levels. The cash portion is due to the operating activity of the quarter. The positive cash flow generated.

Plus the margin outflow is relatively low. So the cash balance will increase in the previous quarter. The hand is more abundant. As for the balance sheet, the balance sheet rose to 22%. As for the balance sheet.

This is mainly because after the PAC permits the declaration. This leads to an increase in current liabilities. However, if you drink USD, short-term borrowings for NT dollars, etc. offset effect. In fact, the debt ratio is only 7.9%.

Overall. While the company is under pressure of low market rents. But the cash flow is stable. The financial structure remains healthy. Let's take a look at the first quarter of 2025.

New Taiwan Dollar for Personality Dissemination. Number of days of operation spread. This one on the left is Casam type. In 2025 and the first quarter of 2024. There are four ships in total. As of the first quarter of 2025.

Only 90 calendar days. Less than a day from last year. Oceania has a four-day suspension in the first quarter. So the total number of business days is 355 days. The one on the right is the passing of CAPSIZE.

Seven ships in total. Same calendar days. Less than a day this year. Mirror Oak in the first quarter of this year. 42 days of single ship reduction. Mainly due to Chinese New Year.

The number of days that cause Dry docking is relatively poor. Also, the number of days of Yushan is relatively poor. The Yushan wheel was in the first quarter of 2025. There are 9 days of Off-Hire. Next, let's take a look at VLOC.

This year's calendar day is 90 days. Less than last year's day. On the right side is VLCC. There are three ships. This year's calendar day is 94 days.

Less than a day from last year. So the total number of days is 270 days. This page is a description. 2025 Q1. Compared to the change in tax pre-employment surplus for Q4 2024. The tax pre-employment surplus for new shipping this quarter is $7.8 million.

Less than $6.5 million compared to last year. Less than $5.7 million. The main reason is because of the channel-type part. The pre-tax surplus is reduced by $42 million compared to the previous quarter. This is because the rent level is relatively low in the first quarter.

Also for similar reasons. The first quarter of this year was less than $1.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The Casam model was flat with other parts. VLCC because there was no Dry docking this year. So the total profit before tax was more than $500,000. Next, let's take a look at the daily rental of Casam model.

Rents in the first quarter of Casam continued to be weaker. The daily rent was about $8000 to $13000. Compared to last year, the current level is still relatively low. There are four main reasons for the weakness of the market. The first one is relatively low levels of coal in China.

The second is China's policy and domestic production. China continues to increase domestic coal production. Reduces imports of ocean-based coal. Limits the demand for Casam-based shipments. In addition, South America exports are weak.

Exports are deferred. Further impacting the demand for the market. Furthermore, global fleets are over-estimated. It is expected to increase by 3% year-on-year. This causes oversupply in the market and inhibits market rental demand. In addition, China's macroeconomic growth uncertainty and a decline in industrial demand.

The rental market has declined month-to-month. These are the reasons that caused the Kasham type rental. The reason for the relatively weak. The performance of the low season is flat. The rental price of the day is approximately between 10,000 and 3 million.

Compared to 2024. relatively stable. Mainly due to China's import of iron ore.

Stabilize demand. Help support the shipping costs of the Strait type. In addition, Brazil and Australia are affected by seasonal rainfall and port congestion. Affects some exports. Australia to China routes become a source of stable demand.

The market sentiment is more cautious and optimistic. Let's take a look at the outlook for 2025. This page is the outlook for Casam.

According to the USDA report, global stocks are expected to decrease by 2.3%. This is mainly due to the decline in production in the United States and Ukraine. According to the IGC, global wheat exports will drop to 43,6 billion tonnes, a new low in three years. Russia will recover slightly, but Argentina will not be able to compensate for this gap.

According to the IMF, global economic growth is expected to be 3.2%, and China and India maintain moderate expansion, so it is conducive to the stability of raw materials imports. The return on infrastructure and steel investment is a potential profit. China has a stimulus economic policy, and it is expected to take effect slowly. In the part of the expansion of the fleet, the CAPSYS fleet growth is expected to be 1.4%, and there is basically no new delivery, so the new supply is relatively mild. Overall, demand is stable, supply is limited, so the market structure is supported.

Rents are expected to remain in a neutral pattern. Next, VLCC looks forward to an annual increase of 1.8% for global crude oil transport, according to the CACS. The main demand is from the expansion of refining capacity in India's Southeast Asia and China. The trade flow of crude oil is in part, and Brazil and Guyana are more focused on Asia's export routes, so it is conducive to the use of VLCC long-haul transport.

In addition, Russian crude oil continues to move to Asia through the Middle East export route, thus increasing the demand for VLCC's fleet. Without a solution to the safety issues in the sea and China, VLCC is expected to break down Africa's good prospects, increasing the average VLCC flight and daily rental. According to the CACS supply section, data from the fleet is expected to grow by 1.1 percent this year. According to the CIA regulations and EUETS regulations, VLCC's cost pressure is increased and then dismantling old ships.

In 2025, the market demand is relatively stable. The daily rent is still relatively weak. Next, let's report the part of the CMN2 project, the CMN2 project is expected to ship by the end of 2025, and the annual production capacity is expected to increase to 1.200 tons in three years.

First of all, the demand for salt tonnage is driven by the demand for salt tonnage in West Africa to China, which is about 11,000 miles, and more than 3,500 miles from Australia to China, so it will effectively support the rent level of this VOC and CAPSYS. In other words, this will also increase the demand for shipping and shipping. The demand for CAPSYS is expected to increase by 100 to 120 per year, and the demand for VOCs is about 60 to 70 pilots. Of course, there will be changes in the structure of competition and shipping.

As part of the CMN2 project, the stability of the CMN2 project will increase, and CAPSYS and VOC will become a long-term major transport ship type. Therefore, the trade route will again be balanced, and the strategy of the fleet configuration will also be adjusted.

We also have some attachments for you to refer to for your own reference. Well, if you have any questions, our law grant will be finished today. Thank you all.
