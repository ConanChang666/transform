Mr. Tse, Financial Secretary. Next, Mr. Tse explains the operation of the company. Thank you. Investment is advanced. Other media friends. Ladies and gentlemen.

From here I will introduce our airdrop. An operation report in Q1, and an operation report throughout the year so far. A condition of operation to date. There is also a second half of the operation. There is a situation of operation in the second half of the year.

I think this company's basic information. I can't explain it. Last year we did a total of 356 million. As we explained last year, we were in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.

Come on, let's see, we have a certain growth. That last law will be over. One or two of the investment advanced to ask me. The Huang Dong daughter is one of the 2025 years. The outlook for an operation is more optimistic.

It is only the eyes of the righteous, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked, and the eyes of the wicked.

We also put a base of Taiwan dollars. This reference base we made a certain adjustment. We are still talking about it the last time. 7 to 10% of the year. We still think that there is a chance of growth of 7 to 12%. So we still maintain the view remains the same.

One of the things that we still cover today remains the same. It includes a sturdy computer with artifacts made by artifacts. The computer with Atomic Tech and East is the same. One of the things that we still cover today remains the same. One of the things that we still cover today is still the same.

That's what East Tech is all about. We've arrived at a time when we'll sum it up as a part of this so-called electronic key product. Nahanda Precision is a plastic business. KIDAK Precision Metal here temperament business. It's a product of an institution.

It is consolidated revenue. That solid computer as a whole. One of our revenues in the first quarter is the situation. The last time we talked to you about the electronic key, we thought it was about 6 to 10 percent growth. So far we still hold the same view.

The main growth is in some public utilities. There is also a field of public safety. Here we can see some pretty good growth. The last time we talked to you about the so-called Precision Marketing.

We can see that we emerge more long-term. That is, some sales force is coming in from 6 to 12 months. So in the past we often happen a few cases. That's when our singles are done. And then there are some singles for the next 3 to 6 months.

We now see one. That's what we call Precision Marketing. Final is a marketing channel above. We see a more adequate example coming in. So for us to 3 to 6 months here a Sales for Opportunity. Or Order a generation.

In fact, we've all seen quite enough. Then there's a slightly different situation on one of the Bases growing up. I think that's a great thing.

Also on top of the military industry. We also saw. It was a very strong growth force. So overall. We saw the second quarter or even the third quarter. We thought it was on a rugged computer.

We all have a good outlook. That's another one in the base energy business. It's slightly different in the first quarter. But by the second quarter it's coming up quickly. And it's only a strong growth. And it's the fourth quarter that's followed.

There are some good prospects. That's mostly where we design services. We've got some new ones, some more Opportunity. This leads to growth. That's all over the place. Our first quarter here looks like a 3% growth.

We added it in the second quarter or the first half of the year. We will have a growth rate of 6-4%. So Q2 for Over is a pretty good bounce back situation. That synthesizer and car agency. We saw a situation here. That's what we talked about last time.

This is the laptop. Because our laptop is specialized in a commercial laptop. Consumer laptops are actually doing less. It's fortunate that so far. We've seen a situation in Lafo that even tariff has started. So far, we've heard that this consumer type of electronic product is a bit weaker.

However, we see a situation in the business of Lafo. It is quite strong. At the same time, there are some supply chain needs to move to this side of Vietnam. As I have previously reported a situation. One of the ability of our part of Vietnam to supply. Is the strongest.

So in the process of this migration, we got most of the singles, so we see this situation. We have a growth in the fourth quarter of the overall. This is in the comprehensive agency. We see a good growth.

So far, we've seen a situation in Japanese game console. Everyone knows they have to make some pre-orders. It's nice to hear that they've written a situation in which they're pre-ordering. So far, we've seen a situation in Rabin.

So we thought it would be the end of the year, and there should be a pretty good growth, a chance of growth, I told you before, this is a part of growing up.

Amplitude is. 6 to 10. 8 to 12 percent. That area we about. By the second half of the year. We adjust it to 10 to 18 percent.

So the whole thing in this field. Yes. There is a growing chance. That car parts. We've been talking to you for over a year.

We're all talking about low-key. We're seeing this market in the temperature again. It's flat before that. It's even a recession that was listed at some point. We're now seeing a single digit as a chance to grow. So we see.

This is what we see in the parable of the soothsayer, and what we see in the parable of the soothsayer, and what we see in the parable of the soothsayer, and what we see in the parable of the soothsayer, and what we see in the parable of the soothsayer, and what we see in the parable of the soothsayer.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim fragments provided, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure the natural transition between paragraphs without interrupting the original timeline. For example, about Q1 2025 financial data and subsequent financial analysis may require a separate segment to maintain a clear presentation of the data. During the processing process, I avoid adding any personal insights or summaries, only structural adjustments.

In addition, check if there are duplicated or merged sentences, but you can't make any modifications based on the user's requirements. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I read the entire paragraph verbatim to ensure that all sentences are properly preserved and paragraphs are properly divided to meet the user's needs. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but based on existing information, try to keep the original intention and structure.

Next year, we feel that this is a situation to prepare, but it should also be able to cope with some needs in the next year. The amount of KPEX last year, the amount of KPEX in 2024, about 1.4 million, and we also look about 1.5 billion up and down this year. So next time we may have the opportunity to change this side of Taiwan to the big word factory. So the base energy here, Taiwan adjacent to Vietnam Hanoi, then our new production line in Hanoi, Vietnam, began to operate production in the first quarter of this year, from a few small quantities, from some of the network products, as well as the US series of Japanese products, all gradually began production there.

Before that, we also asked about a factory in Thailand, where we are still observing, and when we are in the right place, we begin to prepare a move to some construction plants. Perhaps there are some advanced friends who will think that there is no other area besides the direction in which you are manufacturing in one direction of operation of Thailand. In fact, we have some partners in the United States there are some cooperation with us, simple some configuration, which we still have the ability to do.

We are also constantly looking at the feasibility of manufacturing in the United States, and we are still close to these things. We are also doing something similar in Europe at the same time, and we feel that a diversity of manufacturing of electronics in these areas is a trend. So this field assumes that there are more progress in the field, and I want to report to you. So I think you can see here is that this is 2025, as you have reported, red is that the electronic key is the Rugged computer with that MVB machine, that 43 blue with that gray part, which is a comprehensive agency and automotive agency.

So the first half of the year we looked at this ratio, about 46% to 48%, the second half of that ratio was about 52% to 54%, and Pretty much looked at it from this point of view, all these things were calculated by us at a new exchange rate, which was about 7 to 12% growth. So the only thing we think of is that in Business Opportunity, we can see some very strong needs, and the needs of customers in this area are still very good. So the only thing we have to do now is to pick up the singles and make it back to the next year.

The other part of the ESG, the CTPE here is a B-level, sustainable evaluation of AA, the SustainLitX ESG risk 17.65, then MSCI ESG is a PPP level. After that, it is very simple to report to you here, then we will again ask the CFO to report to you, thank you. (There are interval timestamps in the middle) All of you, so today I will report to you the results of our 1st quarter of 2025. At this point in the first quarter, our revenue reached 9.55.2 million, then YY said we have a growth of 9.7%. That in the gross profit section, we reached 2.9 billion, with a growth of 11.9%. In the gross profit section, there was an increase of 0.6%, YY.

In terms of operating profit, we reached 1.42.2 million and operating interest rate reached 14.9%. The net profit attributable to the parent company was 1.2 billion million, in this growth rate was 11.2%, EPS was 1.98, and growth was 9.4%. This quarter should be in the net profit attributable to the owners of the parent company, and if it is a normal net profit, it is an innovative and high season.

It is also the part of the merger business profit, and also 14.2.2 billion is more than the previous five quarters. That business gross profit, we reached 31.1%, although less than 0.7% of QOQ, which is mainly our share, just in Huang Dong has a share of the revenue of each of our previous business units, the establishment of this comprehensive agency is relatively high this year, the first quarter is relatively high, so there is a slight increase in the total gross profit rate of this merger.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph transcript:. Pull down a little. But in terms of the gross profit of each business, each of us has grown. That's for the combined benefit of 14.9%. It's also a pretty good quarter. It's probably quite comparable to the third quarter of last year.

In terms of the consolidated balance sheet, there are 1.41 billion of our cash and other financial assets. Revenue accounts are 97 billion, which is more than last quarter. This is because our revenue in this quarter is also a record high relationship, especially in March, with revenue reaching 3.7 billion.

In addition, the part of the inventory is seven billion, which is the same as the quarter. The other part is, probably not much difference. Here we look at the operational capacity, we just see that the cash is 14 billion, the inventory, the turnover rate here, is 87 days, compared to the previous quarter, although the absolute amount of growth, but in fact, the number of turnovers is still lower than the previous quarter.

The most important thing is to pay your bills, and here we have a slightly less relationship. That's what we all should know, we've announced that this year's interest rate is 6 bucks, so it's probably our interest rate is 83%. It's also a very good rate, and it's a bit better than last year's. Thanks for the above report, thanks. Next is Q&A time, and if you have any questions, please ask us, we'll go to the staff to collect, thank you.

I think this is already a trend, especially in some different, especially in the dressing up, UAV related UAV above some requirements, etc. In this regard, I would like to apply to the military regulations of a laptop, so I would like to have a special relationship with the two-bedroom shutdown. The second problem is that the general laptop visibility is low, especially in the U.S. market, and of course, the company's order visibility is rising, why, we just did a relative situation, because we did do something about it, because we did do do a part of the composite components, is that commercial account, in fact, we do a consumer laptop market, we are doing a very low, the overall look we see a situation, in the U.S. commercial situation is not the difference.

I think that the impact level is the same, so I think since everyone's impact is consistent, so the only problem is that overall needs are less, the only one is that these things should not be too much impact, because basically the business we do, mainly in the fortune 500, or some public agencies, etc., the problem is not much.

I'm going to change it gradually. That's what I told you the last time. We've seen this once. It's the whole truth. The first thing it needs is a new generation of CPU. Then it's more memory that needs a big size.

Hard disk drive. The three things. I want to listen to you. Everyone knows one thing is that it is higher in price.

This is good news for us because it represents some of the values we sell. Amount of money is an increase. It is not meant to be used to describe the change slot.

I think we're in this field. It's not easy to see such a situation. It's a progressive. We actually see it happen. So how to see an outlook on AI Rugged Computers. In fact, some of our customers are also beginning to seek.

There are a lot of people out there who are in the middle of their journeys, and they are in the middle of their journeys, and they are in the middle of their journeys, and they are in the middle of their journeys.

Some of the applications on the AI Rugged Computers above are urgently needed to work with them, and I think these engagements can be created appropriately, and we have more expectations in the market.

That I think of G-TECH as a market above. A leading brand. We all got these influences early. These notifications come together. So I think. There are a few evolutions for more applications in this area.

I think it is very positive. It will bring us more applications. Then it will give us some opportunity to sell. Please ask if the tariff area customers ask for distribution. That customer will not ask for distribution.

He didn't speak to us and then called us to pay. I think that's it. But I think we're all in the industry. I've just explained to you how many major prayers we have. We're all a factor in adjusting the price.

That's why we want to move it to Taiwan. That's why we want to do it as quickly as possible.

Our factory in Taoyuan expands it as soon as possible. But I think I've just had a few. There are several different places that explain things about tariffs. I think tariffs are a question of overall. How can we make it possible?

We have already done this, so we don't think there's going to be too much of a situation.

I think we have some capacity in mainland China. Oops said these constructions are actually not very expensive. So I think we too. Based on some new businesses we are looking for.

In fact, there are some new opportunity on the market. Constantly in production. I want to expand some of the new markets. New product new solution. It has always been a responsibility of our responsibility to bring a better development to the company.

As I have just explained to you about that. The base energy business group. He also found some new applications. So in the third quarter of this year, there will be a good growth.

We think. I want to have a very good value in China. Making a good supply chain. I think there should always have the opportunity. Being able to create new value. I want to ask the company a gross profit margin.

I think we have an integrated gross profit margin. Just like the Chief Financial Officer explained. Last year was about 31.8. This year was about 31.1. I think the gross profit margin as a whole.

Rugged PCs are a bit taller. Overall, it's a good idea to look at yourself on average. Ask why EQ Rugged PCs are relatively low. What are the main aspects that are expected in the future 2Q3Q4Q4Q? I think our Rugged PCs are relatively low in the first quarter.

Mostly it was that one. It was lowered there. There. So I just started talking to you. Our electronic keys are divided into two parts. One is a solid computer.

One is the base electric energy product business group. The base electric product business group its sales of low-dose is a little different. In that second quarter it bounced back sharply. So the proportion of solid computer is not relatively low. This use of the emergency ych several.

Kimchi. I think we all have a great build. In fact, we all run it. I think it's incredible. So I want to market on top of the market as a whole.

Or directly sales business development on top of it. I think we can all have a better transparency. What is the output of the Vietnam plant this year? How much sales and profits are expected to be contributed. We put production in Vietnam. We are constantly increasing its production capacity at any time.

Since we've been constantly moving, we've always been a situation. Last year was more of a production of some of our products. This year has been. I don't have a number here. I don't know how to wait for the Chief Financial Officer to have no chance.

I don't have a number here. I think we've always been single. We try to get it out. So we really need to precise number.

Maybe next time we can prepare a little bit more. See if it can be used. Then I want to sell the whole of a sales. A factory in Vietnam. We have two factories in Vietnam. One is a comprehensive institutional voucher.

One is a car agency voucher. It's probably about 10% of our annual revenue. It's probably not much. I think it should be this year's guts feeling. 28 to 38.

Up to 30% growth. OK.

In the future, the United States of America will be set up in Europe. I just wanted to explain it to you.

If you want to know more about what we are doing now, what we are doing now, what we are doing now, what we are doing, what we should be doing, and what we should be doing soon. tariff is a very important factor to consider, let's assume that we need to do differentiate, or our competitors to do it there, so I think we are very good competitors, they are not going to lie down, the competition in this field is very intense, so we will always be working with some of these things.

There are some of the biggest problems with advanced investing in this part of the exchange rate, I think I unified all the answers, then I think you are advanced experts, and I understand that this year's exchange rate from the highest 33. 205 rupture, sorry to depreciate the US dollar, until 29. 8 on May 8, the % of that appreciation is about 10 points, the % of TWD appreciation is about 10. 3 %, but we have the effect of January to April, I think we all know that it is the end of April although the effect is not too much in the last days, but in May, there will certainly be a relatively large impact, so we basically in May we expect that we are all 32. 5 to make an estimate, so if this is the interval, we have to do the simulation, this part of the absolute value, it is 6.8%, the $6. 8, but a single appreciation is a future appreciation is 6.8%. For our gross profit, we are very concerned about our gross profit, which is to say, for our gross profit, it will not be only 4%, for our gross profit, it will be a little bit, because we have some RMB cost, some other currency cost, so this part will have a development of about 4%, so this part will have a development of about 4%, so it is likely that this part of us will have a development of about 4%, so the effect on the absolute value should be a little bit, but if the gross profit itself is a little bit higher, but if the gross profit is slightly higher than the current, the gross profit will be slightly higher than the original expected, so it is likely that we will increase some of the gross profit, but we will increase a little bit more than the first part of May. Of course, the future is just a concern or think about the impact on our gross profit, of course, the future is just a worry about our gross profit, of course, the future is just a worry about our gross profit, or think about the impact on our gross profit, of course, the future is just a worry about the future or think about the impact on our gross profit, but this gross profit because we just use an absolute number to use the exchange rate to do a simulation of our gross profit, but in fact, because there are a lot of factors in the future because it is a real long time, so it is not necessarily in this part of this part, so I can summarize about 3 percent, so the impact of our gross profit rate will go up, the impact on our gross profit rate, so if we can no longer be more than the amount of the amount of the cost of this year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them to paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription provided in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

In the same way, questions and answers about the production of Sumitomo products also need to be presented in a consistent manner. During the processing process, you may encounter duplicate or duplicate questions, such as "Is there a product that is higher than expected in Vietnam factory street order" many times, need to confirm whether it is a duplicate entry, but according to user requirements, can not delete anything, so all duplicate sentences must be retained and arranged appropriately in paragraphs. Also, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the conversion between paragraphs is natural and does not interrupt the original time order. For example, questions and answers about the ratio of strong Q1 revenue in 2025 need to be organized together in order to keep the relevant sentences fluid.

Finally, check the whole paragraph verbatim to make sure that no sentences are missing, all content is correctly arranged in chronological order and logical relationship, while keeping every sentence in the original text unchanged. Once completed, confirm that it meets all the requirements of the user, especially without deleting anything. </think> [ Paragraph verbatim verbatim]: So we also have a lower cost rate. So, of course, our control above fees is also more controllable. That last year we spent more money and we also had a more cost rate target.

Last year we spent more on this so-called marketing part. This part of the precise marketing part. It was probably more on this year than on the RD fee. That's because we've also grown in revenue because of this number. So we expect this fee rate to remain below 16%, so this part should be under control.

There are others to consider. There is another advanced investment in the question. That is, Sumei products are all produced by non-China. Now we are part of Sumei. We are all produced by Taiwan.

A simple answer. Here's an advanced question for investing. Q1 Rugged Revenue accounted for 47% in 2025. QOQ and YY showed a decline. The main reason for this is that I think we're in 2025.

We. We were in 2025. Just to let you know. That is, we grew our QOQ on this side of the electronic key. YY we grew about 3%. In fact, we also grew more than last year's fourth quarter.

The amount amount of money is growing. The part that you look at as a percentage looks relatively low. Mainly because we pull more in the synthesis parts in the first quarter on this side of the pull-down. So make it look like this is a problem on the scale.

While growing up. While growing up. The other is smaller. So the main problem is this. That's the other solid computer area in 2025. The estimated size of that.

We see a Rugged Computer I want to say in Europe. The United States is about 40% to 50%. The European part is about 30% up and down. The other is about 50% up and down. This is not the 15th of yesterday.

The first AI Rugged PC was released yesterday on the 15th in the world. The new B360A10B was the same as the previous one. I thought we had a price for a new product in Europe. We just published a price that we didn't really have. So it's not easy to tell you how much one of these individual products is keeping up with the next generation.

But in general, we see that AI Rugged PCs are probably about 10% more expensive than non-AI Rugged PCs. Pretty much about 10% more expensive than non-AI Rugged PCs. This is probably the case. Is it possible that an optional NVIDIA stand-alone graphics card should be paired with an NVIDIA stand-alone graphics card to reach the AIPG level? I think that a NVIDIA stand-alone graphics card is a requirement for some of the more professional graphics displays or AI displays in this field.

That's because it's high in the past. It's probably not a requirement for AI. That's how much an ASP difference it has with NVIDIA stand-alone graphics cards. It's a very subjective judgment. I probably won't be able to tell you that it's probably 300 to 500 dollars per piece.

I don't have a detailed analysis here. That's exactly what this AI Rugged PC is doing right now. In fact, our new B360 is a market that we're very focused on selling. We're a model of a new refreshment.

If the structure parts are raised to 10 to 18% throughout the year. I would like to refer to the integrated body parts. Is it a product that Vietnam factory street is higher than expected. Is it a product that Vietnam factory street is higher than expected. Is Vietnam factory street higher than expected. Is it a product that Vietnam factory street is higher than expected. Is it a product that Vietnam factory street is higher than expected.

Is Vietnam's factory street a product higher than expected. Is Vietnam's factory street a product higher than expected. I think the two main factors are that we are in addition to the original high-wave wire material. We also do the related aluminum stamping of a metal part of a product. So in fact, we have more than one market.

That's one reason. That's another reason why I just wanted to tell you that we're in that game console it's a new generation of products. It's sold out because it's already in the last generation of products.

Your new product comes out. It also leads to a growth of so-called incremental. So a YOY is raised to 10 to 18% among the synthesizers. The Vietnamese factory street is expected to have a higher order. The answer is yes. I just explained it to you.

At present, the notebook results are based in Vietnam, China. The future goal of Vietnam is to increase. The notebook results are based in China to increase the proportion.

Let's take a look at the overview first. We're in China's auto parts, this one is a big recession. There's really no clear recession here in Vietnam, so it's slightly smaller than that.

trajectory. ciao. mouse. The growth of the sensitivities to counteract the impact of the exchange rate.

What else is more than expected is that there will be more to share with us. I think that one of the potential ministers of the overall revenue will also explain to you. In fact, everyone can see that I just reported to you about the overall operation of a condition of our overall atmosphere of our mobile is growing.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription after reordering:. Corrected the one, our comprehensive institutional line adjustment to 10 to 18 percentage, which you would like to think about how big a range is. In fact, we see a relatively high part, but after all, there is always an uncertain factor in some of the factors that tariff shipped, but we think that the commercial laptop hunger should be relatively much more stable than the consumer this is going to be.

The only problem I have is that we will adjust the tariff at a price, which is currently, because we are 90 days, 10 days, so we are not going to buy the stock of the product price refers to B Mister, so if we say that it is time to talk about the unit more than 90 days later to talk about the degree of recurrence to Mockup, thank you. Like a relatively high ratio, I have a 90 day grace period, of course, I personally think he will return to the original 36% probability, I personally think the opportunity is not much. That said, as you said 10-5%, in fact, we have a certain chance to adjust some of our own, part of the competition is that I am willing to bear a part of the price on my own, I am able to change to a relatively large amount of revenue, but maybe my gross profit I assume that can increase or otherwise.

Our Vietnam problem, our Vietnam mold factory was set up about 10 years ago in Vietnam, we are probably the largest mold factory in some of our relevant industries, but even this, in fact, his mold factory production capacity is insufficient, so we still have about one-third to half of the mold, we have to go to the mainland of China to complete the mold operation and then move to Vietnam.
