<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and organize it into paragraph transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription fragments provided by the user one by one, paying attention to the timestamps and the corresponding sentences. In the example given by the user, there are many gaps between some sentences, such as [42. 00-466. 00] and [466. 00-467. 00], which may mean that the speaker is paused or switched. I need to judge which sentences belong to the same paragraphs, which need to be separated.

First, I will sort the timestamps and the corresponding sentences in order, and then segment them according to logic and context. For example, the greetings and introductions at the beginning should be combined into a paragraph, followed by a description of the financial data, and then a market analysis, and the final product portfolio and financial results. It should be noted that some sentences may not be continuous over time, but the content is coherent and need to be grouped reasonably.

In addition, there are some examples of timestamps between users, such as [42. 00-466. 00] to [466. 00-467. 00], which may indicate that the speaker has been paused or switched for a long time, which may require subsequent content as a new paragraph to begin. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of the sentence to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural. During the finishing process, I will check for missing or wrong timestamps in a sentence and make sure that each sentence is correctly classified into the appropriate paragraphs. For example, part of financial data may need to merge multiple timestamped sentences, while the market analysis part needs to separate paragraphs according to different regions.

The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim script (keep all the original sentences intact, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed):

On behalf of U.S.-U.S.-U.S.-U.S.-U.S. Electronics, we welcome you to today's Falun Dafa Briefing Session. Today's Falun Dafa Briefing Session will be held by Chairman Wei Wang, General Manager Lin Bin, and Chief Financial Officer Xu Chengtze.

Next, I will give my time to Chairman Wei Wang. Hello everyone, I am very lucky to have you in the afternoon. I would like to thank you for coming to my office. I would like to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Azawa. I would like to introduce to you that I am an immigrant.

One of the main things I think you can do with him is a wave of coaching. For the global industry, it is the foundation of our industry. And to put it another way, he is currently taking my lead. We have a lot of media friends. And we have our entire public sector.

He will continue to support us internally. I look at the one that came out this year in 2024. The result of our self-determination will not be passed today. The whole GP is 18.1%. The whole OP is 52%.

6,9 billion billion. Then the whole net is 5 billion. EBS was 1. 72%. Compared to the first three last year, the whole situation was flat. So overall.

It is expected that the entire process will be very straightforward. These over-the-counter operations are caused. The water level should have been adjusted by the second half of the year. It looks like it will be adjusted to the second half of the year right now. So it is expected that the fourth half of the year will be expected.

This is due to a non-transactional relationship. This time is probably going to happen in the early days. So the speed of a clear order is at the end of the day. The overall order in Q2 Q3 Q4 has already been ordered in a sequence.

There is a long-term order, or there is a way to advance. That is to say, the adjustment period in Europe was earlier than the United States. But the problem in Europe was that there was no real return.

So he adjusted the speed to 6 words. This is probably the Q. The Japan adjustment is the slowest. So the Japan adjustment is also followed. It is also finished by this year. In the second half of the year, there is actually a backdown.

At the time there was no back in. Most of last year's top line. On the North American movement. The basic level of the private business in North America was low. It was very light-adjusted. All the Admi-Qs in North America were able to act very well.

So we did not see this product. Admi-Q belongs to a very bad taste. The whole North America of Alfie is not too big, mainly the introduction of a new product, that is, the introduction of a CAPELEON.

He used Liao's weapons to do this interaction. This is the introduction of our new product in North America. We are mainly able to contribute to this last year. There is no such contribution. Last year's top line with our Try-TWIST will also become serious.

In fact, there are two mainstream markets. The Indian market and the Japanese market. I just mentioned the two markets relative to each other. It is relatively true that I have not seen the Chinese factory. So there is still a relatively large identity mainstream. The Chinese market was basically weak last year as well.

It is mainly due to India's market and we support it. India's wide goods to the last year and the Third World War. It also basically started to have a position in the Pacific Ocean. India's bullishness began to rise in about 18 years.

In fact, last year Hong Kong and India had the whole fixed water level. It was probably the best place to escape. The main growth of India is from South Korea. That is, when you look back and look at it again, you have to rely on India to solve it.

We are 100 meters away. You can see last year's third quarter as a whole. Especially in the fourth quarter, India is able to maintain a large number of reasons. Because it is getting more and more inaccessible. North America and India are all taken care of by a single product.

This decline in the wideness of the whole tradition. The so-called Kucheng peach. Depends on these two to make the mainstream. So you can see the four seasons on the island. Let's see last year about. The currency of New York is reduced by about 10%.

But take a look at the 8% of our overall currency. For example, it is called the sea capital. About 1.5% of the GPK. The proportion of the GPK is related to the proportion of the new Taiwan dollar. But the proportion of Korean products is relative.

It is also more profitable than our traditional department. The proportion of New York is a bit better, so we can see that this is a baseline of last year's proportion.

It's been almost a year, but you can see it all year round.

The revenue was just mentioned. Topline dropped about 9.3%. That's the whole GP. We also got nearly 1.6%. So the whole OP water level was 5.2%.

So the entrance was about 29.1%. The water level of such an OP. The overall balance was 217,000 million. So last year, South Korea's cross-market level fell by 5%. Of course, the whole saw this.

This is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the wicked is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the righteous is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the righteous is the reward of the righteous.

Open road or quite long. So you can see the entire financial space. On the space above the cost, or the requirements are relatively low.

A. A. Of course, the larger the share capital rose from 2.6 billion to 2024. Mainly the CB we released a few years ago. In the last year we converted all of it. Of course, there were significant changes in the results.

But it is not in balancing. Of course, such a result is the pressure for us to consume. Do such a arrangement. Mainly this balancing is between Pandemic in front of us. We are rather Stretch. Because at the time the shares were higher.

Of course, we are also optimistic about the current capital allocation of the future. This should be a comparison of pointers to 10 billion. It should be a comparison of pointers to 10 billion. OK Next. We look at this as a portfolio.

It is the Lord's work, and the Lord's work, and the Lord's work, and the Lord's work, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his law, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, and his righteousness, etc.

AW is the capital of North America. Both are located north of North America. Including our entire Cabernet Hague.

Here is the re-routing paragraph type transcript:. In a calm situation every day, IoT here in fact, we traditionally in the health control part becomes stronger, home security home automation is more strong. Basically, it is smoke, last year all day is smoke. Can maintain the benefit here is mainly in a few new segment has been introduced. This contains the whole of the Utility, that is, the power of the equipment, the power of the Internet there are some as such medical equipment, these Internet input can see that it has some new order machine to compensate for our original weakness.

The enterprise here, you can see that last year was 621% has been 24%, fell to this 568 million, this 18 percent has lost such a 51. So the main decline is last year's adjustment here, and the adjustment is quite large. This adjustment can be seen in fact it is a big reason that in 2022, excess purchases are 50 to 60 percent more than we usually buy. This is obviously not much over the market, because there are a lot of out-of-stock restocking, and the restocking is also a way to get to the full amount of time.

That's basically a situation over time in 2023, and 2020 is adjusted. So now we can almost see that 2025 should be back to 2022 level. So it's a must increase with last year's statistics than these three years, because it's a very low level. So we can now see that this level is a very low level. This level is a very low level because it's a very low level.

This level is a very low level. It is white, and I just mentioned the 24 years process of this numeral 24 years process. The total assets from 477 billion to 41.9 billion, this shrinks about 6 billion. This shrinks about 6 billion. The main so-called pure goods, pure goods from the end of 23 years 175 billion to the present 115 billion.

This is because the whole process of adjustment is going all the way here. My head is in tune, and I am also in line. The adjustment process of course, there is a tone to hit, and my bottom spray is very clear that this toilet is not clear about a last-minute notification. So we can try to hit as much as we can. So the overall look now is back to a level of steel we thought we were going to use. And relative to the current, these so-called shipping Lagrime is basically consumed.

This is the whole asset aspect of Lagrime mainly because we see our long debt transition to Iquity from 1.3 billion to 163 billion. This is mainly a rise in CP, that is, our current Iquity and SRE are about 139%. This training from B-School from our Cash is too much for us to use so much cash.

As you can see, my Asset is actually from the current total of 477 billion to 41.9 billion total Asset. My Iquity now stands at 163 billion. If you catch a relatively conservative Iquity Ratio, we have a total of 257 to 353kg of Cushion in the car. This is my casual guide to this guide. I want to make sure that you have a certain amount of Cushion in your car for Payment, because we can't guess where it will go in the future.

So we have to be prepared. We believe that Q2 will come to the storm is comingIt's going to hurtIt's going to rain very hardIt's going to rain very hardIt's going to rain very hardIt's going to rain very hard. So we're going to do it as quickly as we can.

This is the way we can think of right now. I think that before the $2.8 billion Cash flow, our last operation received about 2.7 billion. Of course, I think this is just an ideal case. The main reason is not because we can close the Cash. It is mainly because we can close the Cash. So the last Cash conclusion in the mainland and then there was the fact that we wanted to make a decision that we could help.

Just as the Chairman said, we are likely to follow the benchmark of 60% of the net profit this year after tax. So according to the figures we have just released this year, we will distribute 4. 6 good benchmarks below 4. 6 today.

We've been there, it's good, it's good, it's good.

Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

Good for you, good for you, good for you, good for you, good for all of us.

There are a lot of injuries in some places. But in fact, we have some comparisons in operation. These exclusion pains may come. Continue to be able to breathe. OK Let's try. The overall Anlai refers to changes in 2025.

Today is February 27th, and we're off to the finish of Q1. Q1 is probably the end of the Collapsing in this Downturn. It's a very clear single that the entire flow is gone. The headwind has basically been slowly removed. Of course, one of the most uncertain is not Headwind and Headwind.

There may be a Storm coming back. This is an uncertain risk. This risk is not high and can't talk to anyone right now.

And so I'm going to share with you. The whole headwind came up with several Trials. The entire adjustment of the firmware I just mentioned was complete. The adjustment of Enterprise is basically clear. The adjustment is complete. The clear fade in order is back.

These traditional broadband in that tone. The addition of this adjustment is also complete and also back. Even we see these security devices. Basically, 2024 is all stopped. We see it back. The intro has begun to flow back.

This is a re-positioning of the traditional base period to a normal water level. This is until the end of the Pandemic Party. Last year all was given. It was too long not to wake up. I think it looks like this year.

That's when the resumption takes place. You should see it from Q2. Our revenues will have a relatively large mobilization climb. The other is the introduction of new products. New products are mainly in the career field. Wi-Fi Server starts to consume.

Consuming in Enterprise Wi-Fi Server. Basic aspects of the operator. We are traditionally stronger to the actual Cable field 4.0. Consuming from Q2. Consuming from Q2. Consuming is now consumed online.

Manufacturing is beginning to consume. That revenue will be seen in April 5th. What we do in February you will see in April. Because we have to go out of our way. That's all. FWA is the biggest support of our operations last year.

FWA has been around for the whole year and we continue to see it running, so we're still 6G now. FWA is the largest.

One of the biggest ones to see in the future is FWA. The upper or lower conditions are. The efficiency of Spectrum is applied. Because it is within 6G Spectrum. There are so many Spectrums. There are probably only so many boxes in this space.

So how do you increase your use of different Spectrum. This is a focus of the future FWA. So this is also the U.S.-China trade strategy department.

It's all very deep. This involves the base station and the base station. It's a problem that interacts with our south and south side. It's a big expectation for our future. We've been part of this department for many years. We feel that there is a chance of harvesting a period.

This is the third part of my reading. The fourth part is the use of the entire IoT. Last year, we were actually the traditional product model. That was largely by Utility, and some by these Healthcare. Perhaps the use of Power.

Today we see that we are basically back. The tone is back. The rise is also really fast. There is another big one: the use of AIG.

The use of AIG. Especially in the use of AIG in Video. This comes from the second half of Q2. You can see that there is an explosive recovery. Here is the current cloud AIG.

As the whole process of this image is above. This model is imported. Make it smarter. This Useability. Higher reliability. This new application we have seen it on the move.

This is what we will see this year mainly. So what you can expect is that this wave of Q2 is probably going to continue. We've made a few adjustments to Q2 before 2024. Adjust to the slopes that start with Q2. This scale will be quite large.

That Q3 Q4 should be gradually growing. And both of them are growing. This is the actual start of the current Budget. That's what I just mentioned. This year's biggest uncertainty is these Geo Power.

Focus on what to do to defeat. Our global layout of our current operations. We are in our central south. We are in the Philippines. We are in Suzhou, Okinawa. We are in the south-western part of India.

We have five of them, and we have five of them, and we have one of them, and we have one of them, and we have one of them, and we have one of them.

We've spent about 10 years in the Philippines. We're already Power. That's the same period as at the end of 2023. We're currently in a similar area to the Taiwan Sea. We've expanded our productivity to the Philippines. We're ready to meet the future of all-round sources.

North America. It accounts for about 60% of our India. Then Asia-Pacific accounts for about 20%. Europe accounts for about 20% of our revenue. So you can see 60% of our revenue in North America. Mainly the Philippines and Taiwan support.

We are all here. We are not particularly interested in the characteristics of Taiwan. The factory of Taiwan is very close to the factory of the Philippines. The two are angels binding. Taiwan is not long.

There is no human.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the transcription fragment provided by the user one by one, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentence.

First of all, I will read through the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses the industry configuration in Taiwan, the Philippines, China, India, and other places, the impact of the shortage of workers, and the international trade and tariffs. The spokesperson also mentioned the preparation of possible trade conflicts. Next, I need to determine how to group these sentences into logically consistent paragraphs. Usually, the paragraphs should start around a topic, so I will look for the relevant sentences and combine them together.

During the processing process, I need to make sure that each sentence remains in its place without any modification. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp and ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, the sentences of timestamp [1338. 28-1340. 28] to [1397. 28-1400. 28] discuss the shortage of Taiwanese workers and the Philippine strategy can be combined into one paragraph.

In this case, I need to maintain the order of the original sentence, even if the timestamp is not continuous, make sure the correct arrangement of the sentence is correct. In the process, also pay attention to the use of punctuation symbols and connection words to make the paragraph more readable. For example, the use of the period, commas and connection words to connect the relevant sentence, but the structure of the original sentence must remain unchanged. For example, the "so relative" in the original sentence can be used as a connection sentence, to guide the next sentence, but the structure of the original sentence must be preserved.

In particular, I want to make sure that I have not deleted, rewritten, or condensed anything, while maintaining the consistency and readability of paragraphs. In summary, my steps include: reading through the content, determining grouping of topics, arranging sentences in logical order, keeping the original sentence unchanged, checking consistency and integrity, and finally making proofreading to ensure compliance with user requirements.

It is not enough for the Philippines to be a new organization, the experience of its cadres in the middle of it, and it is far from the research and development. Therefore, it must have some difficulties in introducing new products. In contrast, we have these experienced engineering personnel in Taiwan, the so-called online cadres lead, in fact, the two sides of the learning package. So they are now strategic, we bind them together.

So we talked about the six layers of the Philippines, which is what we currently have. Now we can see that the combination of the market is 622, our entire industry configuration is also 622, in the Philippines 6 layers, in China about the remaining 2 layers, and in India the remaining 2 layers. India is 100% for the free market of India, the Philippines is mainly for the United States, the Philippines Taiwan is mainly for the United States, and then China is for Japan and Europe, it is probably the situation of such a distribution.

We believe that from a variety of perspectives, the whole of the Plapie area, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, are our high-rise areas, there is a lot of support, there is no chance to hit, why, only you hit, what to do in Taiwan, then you see how quickly each family changes, Taiwan and the real relationship with the scene, then you Taiwan also go to non-ship cards very rich, very rich, the whole trade and the so-called smoothness between the United States, about 40 years have been discussed, so it is not only because we are in Taiwan banks, he does not see what the United States wants, you have to touch a rare land, or you have to touch a rare land, if you do not have these things, he has no reason to hit you, so the theory is simple, today is a point in a business bureau security, and we can only wait for it when it happens. In the past year, we broke the capacity of non-shipping, so I think the capacity of non-shipping is actually standing at this point, I definitely have the opportunity to eat all the property of Taiwan if there is a situation in Taiwan, we can eat all the property of Taiwan, this is a high degree of certainty, then there is a time, it is also from time to time, can be removed immediately, then it is not necessary to fight it, it is not necessarily a long time to hit, it is not necessarily a long time, when you get a card, you can take away, this in Mexico can not see what he wants, these things we can not clearly inhibit his situation, we can only say, on the contrary, to the CIO, for me personally, we may not be in a relatively deep position, so when the selection may not follow each other, I go with, I also go with the NATO, we do not go together, we choose a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of human feeling, his labor, his labor, his work, his work, and then he is the whole party is the risk, he is the first, he is not the US, we do not a different way.

If you are not familiar with this concept, you are not familiar with this concept, and if you are not familiar with this concept, you are not familiar with this concept, you are not familiar with this concept, and you are not familiar with this concept, you are not familiar with the concept of factor, because the property is too shy, so I just mentioned that, the overall responsibility of adjustment, we seem to adjust the direction, the whole demand is not too low. Our news industry, we research and development spending or more than others, this research and development expenditure is not in the future, there is no way in the future, deliver these values, that management is equal to do things wrong, on the contrary, such investment in relation, no one recognizes us, because we have not yet delivered, so you basically have not with us relation, I A and B different formulas compared, why these two formulas, are doing a larger research and development, because it is not good research and development efficiency, or its multi-functional, so this, has not been deadline, this is also my biggest impression on me.

I think in 2020 we will have more bright, new possibilities, not only in Taiwan, we will have very new, we will see more juicy products will enter, this overall outlook, I will report with you today, will make us even more wonderful, now the new classic decoration is also Mercy, right, this situation, the first to use three, this time, this time, I will be here, this boys, today, we will all because of your body operation. - 1997, 정 Le, early, this year, today, today, is the main color, girls, want to ask two questions. The first is here in India, this Copule A, will not give us a little bit of growth, because, because in fact, we have a lot of the same thing, but also a lot of the same thing, we have a lot of the same thing, a lot of the same thing, the same thing, we do, we know, we do, we do, the next time, the same thing, the same thing, thank you, we have a lot, the next time, the same thing, the same thing, we do, the same thing, we have a lot, the same thing, the same thing, we have a lot, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, we do, we do, we know, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, we know, we do, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, we do, the same thing, the next next next next next next time, we do, we do, the same thing, we have a lot, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, the same thing, the same thing, we have a lot, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same, we, we, we do, we, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same, the same, the same thing, the same, we, we

The average grace advantage for Guo Wen for your business. Because his money is more advantageous. So when this situation occurs. When the mobile phone gets more and more in, the average will not be enough. This is currently the largest constraint.

"We have two things for you to do," he said, "and you have to be careful, or you have to be careful.

We use the average. The average can get it. It involves better modulation. The design of better threading. This stuff is terrible. And of course.

Go to the high screen. On the high screen there is a whole piece of the average. On the opposite. This low satellite is used. At 13 o'clock, you say no. 27.

No. 16 is No. 8, a bunch of people were not careful, there, go up there, it must be a big fight in the future.

The time for the import of this place. It may be a bit later. Because it will have some verification process. There is also a verification process. That can be seen. North America and India at FWA.

This year has grown several times. Entering the high-flow zone. It can't be like last year. This point is up. It has gone to the high-flow zone.

So we're growing this year. We don't rely on FWA to learn our growth. I'm just this machine. This machine will have a base.

To be able to go up again in the future. To be new. Completely mechanical technical skills. To be new. To be able to be specific. This is the key.

I ask you to do matching for AI. Mrs. can. In terms of AI input. Before last year. Because of market opportunities generated by deep-seated AI. Almost all in 457.

You and Illinois are there. And that's what it takes. We've been there for a while, and we've seen some chip makers. They've launched the so-called dual MPU architecture. The dual MPU architecture is.

The first N is the processing unit of the network. The second N is the nerve. The AI is talking about a processing unit of the neural network. The two are just beginning with A. Then the dual MPU architecture.

There are some AI. Deep AI. It is possible to get started in the cloud. This is the middle or this is the application of this semi-cloud.

This mid-end is the strength of our company. Our company is invested in AI. It should be about ten years. Because of this new dual MPU architecture some of the chips. We have started. Apply some deep-dose AI in the cloud.

Let's start with the middle of this director. This can be done here. At least you should see it next year. Quick appearance can also be seen this year. Some related products come out. Here are a few.

There are several applications of nodes. They are applied to the soothers of the entire image processing. This is definitely more difficult for us to learn. We have seen the image detected before. Of course, we will throw a video for you. This is what Lin Tung is doing now.

You are a woman who receives a coffee sweater. Or you will receive a pair of glasses. A woman who wears a scarf is active in your home. You will receive this start.

It is what you call LVM. In the future we call LVM. LVM is also how much it doesn't take me together. It doesn't take me together with Taxi. It actually makes an impression on TV.

We had the best of the best before, and we had the best of the best, and we had the worst of the worst, and we had the worst of the worst, and we had the worst of the worst of the worst.

These judgements were previously based on our so-called Deep Learning. Repeatedly in training. Repeatedly in training. After the integration between the cloud and the end. I know there is something moving. I know what is going on.

And I went up to it, and it came to pass, that it was he who spake unto me, and said unto me, Son of man, go into the land of the living, into the land of the living, into the land of the living, into the land of the living, into the land of the living, into the land of the living, into the land of the living, and out of the land of the living, into the land of the living.

Know that it comes back to you now. The more accurate it is. Because it is the same. So this application will definitely be a bit of a breakthrough in the future. That is to say, security control before 24 hours real-time monitoring. After that, all are carousel monitoring.

This must be Low Meaningful. It must be the whole edge of the front end. It must be on this pairing. I just said it. I have to use it.

I can't throw all my VDs up. I'm going to be blind. I'm going to throw them out to protect me, or I won't use them. The combination of these two is cloudy and cloudy. We're on top of this.

As you can see from the May of this year. There is a lot of volume of this product. This product comes after. Of course it is definitely a new era of revolution. This. Some medical equipment.

And he went forth, and spake, and spake, and spake, and spake, and spake unto him, and spake unto him, and he spake unto him, and he spake unto him, and he spake unto him, and he spake unto him.

He wants to be careful when he wants to. Basically similar AI device. Put on the body. That is actually the voice of the AI, so it is like the image of the AI. The voice of the voice of the AI.

Then he went on to say, 'We have seen all these things, and we have seen them, and we have seen them, and we have seen them; we have seen them, and we have seen them, and we have seen them; we have seen them, and we have seen them; we have seen them, and we have seen them; we have seen them, and we have seen them, and we have seen them.'

This is easy to understand, but we have seen a few of them before, and when the internet is created, you have to invest in the internet to build the network.

This is what we call the Catnet to invest in, after investment, after the future of luck, Chunghwa Telecom is also good, singing, Taiwanese, a lot of people are against the reputation, what is not the best? To the heart of the people station, domain design, domain configuration is not optimized, we this line is interrupted after where, your home Wi-Fi can not be, bend him, do not get Wi-Fi or connect, these voice problems are basically all artificial. The next generation of total domain, all of it, this kind of thing, all of this kind of judgment is basically artificial, so this is a general opportunity, you can not see, for us, this is a big, these people need to be protected, because he needs, he needs to break the root, as long as you need to break the root, we can complete, because we are in Evidence House, our image, we put so many people to talk about him, he really speaking in ten years, he did not want, he did not want to do, he did not want twelve years. When we get up, we must, because we have the technology, we know how to do, we are not to tell people how to do this, before you do this, before you do this, we try to use the earliest neural network in Chain our video, when the CPU is not strong, the long way in the testoxin, the CPU is becoming more and more difficult, of course, the application of our water consumption is going to come out here, and I just mentioned that the core network, the entire network of AI construction on the network, this is involved an arbitrary, I now put money, after I put it, I am not the only person to pay, this is a K-Pax by O-Pax action, here, a few operators, they are more casual, he can imagine the next five years, I don't need so much of the people, so I want to go back to the director, if he said what he said to say, I don't want to look at me every day, I don't want to watch the screen, I't look at the day, I's, I't want to see it, I's. So, in the end of the preparation is to meet this possibility, that is, you will see unity in this book, we this year, the second quarter, to the following one, this is the use of this people, we really let the Internet of things may be the use of AI, it is 2009, we actually started, there are three four of the four singles here, I want to pull the punch I can give you three four more BS, then you see the AI I didn't give me a face, then we'll see that tomorrow we'll come to this AI, next time, please don't come back to this AI, I want to ask you, in addition to existing customers, there are other new customers, or join the production momentum, that's the question, 2025 week, growth will come from the old product, or mainly from the contribution, that is the gross rate, this year's trend, and the second question is the question is to ask again the new product, including the new product, the question of 2025.

In general, the main customers will probably no longer mention things, maybe after all, we can not mention a few markets for investment, we can continue to tell you that the North American market is the most important for us, which is in North America.
