<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim text provided by the user in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence.

For example, the host welcomed the guests, followed by the guests, and then the guests began to speak, introducing the company's situation, products, market performance, etc. During the process, I needed to ensure that the sentences in each section are consistent, but did not change the order of the original sentence. For example, when the guests introduce the company, there may be several sentences describing the company's position, product type, development, etc., which need to be merged into the natural paragraph, but the position of each original sentence cannot be changed. At the same time, pay attention to the processing of time stamps.

In the example provided by the user, timestamps are retained, but in the final paragraph-based verbatim, it may be necessary to remove the timestamp, only the content. However, the user does not explicitly specify whether the timestamps need to be retained, so it is necessary to confirm. Depending on the example provided by the user, they may want to remove the timestamp, only the content, so I will deal with the timestamp part, only the sentence itself.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the oral expression, such as repeating, stuttering, correcting, etc., which need to be kept as it is, and cannot be modified during finishing. For example, guest lectures may have a "what is a projector?" question, or "memory" such as these, all need to be kept as it is. During the process, I also need to pay attention to the convergence between sentences to ensure that the paragraphs are smooth. For example, when the guest transitions from the introduction company to the product, it may be necessary to combine the relevant sentences together to form a natural transition paragraph.

At the same time, make sure the format is correct without using any Markdown, keep the text plain. Now, I need to translate the thought process into actual finishing work to ensure that every step is in line with the user's requirements and that the final results are accurate.

We are honored to invite you to join us. Vice President Maoquan Ke to share with us. We will give you the time first to the Vice President Ke. Start the forum. Thank you. Thank you all.

Where's the projector?

Let's face it, we're here for you, and we're here for the first quarter of this year.

This is a disclaimer Please refer to it. It is part of the group. Let's talk about this part again. I might have to introduce the formula outside. Memory.

One power electronics is now in our Taiwan industry. It is a relatively flat position. How do you do it? Because it is in the automotive industry. Taiwan is more of a cloud component.

But make cloud components. For example, do some coking. Do something more. It's not very much like our system products. System products are called T1. It's the factory that faces it directly.

So we are now. Our company's industry pattern is more than 90%. All are directly to the car factory. That is, we are directly to the car factory to do the whole research and development work.

That is to say, many manufacturing companies in Taiwan make cloud components. In fact, we will go to sea for them, because they have to deliver our products to our hands, and then export.

We are OETA1 manufacturers. Our R&D center is mainly in Taiwan. We are in Tibet. Because we are there, there are about 200 R&D personnel.

So we made it to the top of the list, and you can see how it works, and you can see how it works, and you can see how it works, and you can see how it works (and how it works).

Every development requires a considerable amount of energy. Because each car is basically the same. Its specifications are not the same. So basically, there are some adjustments for each car.

For example, we do information communications products. We do instruments. In fact, every company's choice will never be the same. It's because it doesn't want you to see it with it. I open the Toyota car. It's impossible to see the shadow on you.

So basically everything is different, that's different, and there's some development energy, so we're all basically doing the same thing, and we've been doing the same thing for many years.

About 20 years is done. It is related to the car. Of course, it may be done early. There are other things. But now all are 100% products of fire. Taiwan is mainly for research and development.

We have been doing this for years, and we have been doing this for years, and we have been doing this for years, and we have been doing this for years.

In fact, the car is now in Taiwan. In fact, there may be some early stages. It may be the flagship version. It may be like a high-end car, you will see the head-up display.

It has slowly penetrated downward. After all, it is a function of head-up display. In fact, it is an extension of driving self-communication. That is, in the past, our public products. From South Asia products. Then adjust to auto self-communication.

Then, after that, we will go back to the place of worship, and then we will go back to the place of worship, and then we will go back to the place of worship.

The integration provides a better value for consumers. An informational connection. Head-up display in Taiwan. In fact, we have a assembly plant here. Just like the whole product I will introduce again.

In fact, Taiwan is also here. In addition to research and development, we may export to the Middle East market. Export to Europe and the United States. Therefore, the Mediterranean of Taiwan is like this.

The sales part is actually concentrated in Jiangsu and Thailand. Jiangsu here is actually a base of operation in China's market. At present, we are mainly with some of the major manufacturers in China to trade.

In fact, from last year about July and August. Auto factory of autonomous brands in mainland China. Finally the whole sales exceeded the joint venture brand. In the past, the total sales of joint venture brands in mainland China. Or more than the whole autonomous brand. If the share of more than 30 million markets in a year.

In fact, the entire self-owned brand accounts for about 40 percent. More than 10 million units. For example, more than 10 million units. There may be six or seventy percent of the new energy vehicles.

So it's a whole market. In fact, it became a competition with foreign manufacturers. In a new energy vehicle is very limited. Because it is a lot of student ability. As we know, BRD. BRD or we educate.

Our guest Geely Car. We count the red flag of the low car group. It is the Chenan Ford Group.

This is the Great Wall. This is the first stage of the journey. In fact, it is from 2024. In fact, in 2024, the Chinese automaker came to see this. In fact, there are still ten or five percent growth.

But the second half may be terrible. The mainland China is actually a factory of two kinds. So if the manufacturer of the craft is in that kind of place. The fact that the market is still increasing.

It's probably the same for many years. It's been a few years before the pandemic. I'm going to explain this. If I say that I'm probably 30 in the continent, you're right. That's a good thing.

The market situation was very good, so now the Chinese market share is very good. But now the space and time context. Because we all know that China is a sizable society.

A roll is a roll of cost. It's a roll of cost. It's a roll in the process. Like our company last year was a typical roll of movement. Like last year we actually grew the whole HQ. It's also growing to 80%.

Then again, the whole continental movement is still growing to 30%. Rolling we can also grow. This means that our company is in that system. In fact, there is a competitive existence, because at that time, we are in that HQ.

This is because the same-sex competition is now very high. The factory is just a different environment. That is, the factory itself has a threshold. It has a technical development experience there.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: [436. 48-438. 64] So it is actually just a few guarantees for us. Especially in the Mainland China market. [438. 80-441. 04] We have been in the Mainland China market for many years, but actually also for us. [441. 20-442. 48] I just told you that we are the main manufacturers. [443. 04-443. 92] We are all manufacturers.

[444. 08-446. 08] We are the main car manufacturers, the main car factories. [446. 24-448. 80] For many years, we are the main car manufacturers. [448. 96-450. 72] Bydy is more regrettable, because Bydy is this production. [450. 88-452. 00] Bydy is this production. [452.1 16-453. 28] It has been a long time. [453. 44-457. 76] The company's business strategy is technically autonomous.

[457. 92-459. 20] So autonomy is the main thing. [459. 36-465. 04] It would like to say that its operator becomes its partner. [465. 20-468. 88] Finally, the operator's function is replaced by it itself. [469. 04-472. 00] So you see BYD's trend integration is very high. [472. 16-472. 88] Bydy's trend integration is very high. [473. 04-473. 92] Bydy's basically car.

[474. 08-477. 12] Seventy-seven percent or eighty percent of the collection is supplied by itself. [477. 28-478. 72] The market itself is supplied by itself. [478. 88-480. 72] Its suppliers give half to it. [480. 88-483. 28] It is made up of finished goods to the factory. [483. 44-486. 48] So it turned out that I was able to deliver the product to you. [486. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64] I was made half to you.

[488. 80-491. 92] So in fact, the past manufacturers like us. [492. 08-494. 24] may actually be related to such a strategy. [494. 40-495. 28] is always in doubt. [495. 44-496. 80] Therefore, there is no special joining. [496. 96-499. 52] So BYD is not currently doing so. [499. 68-501. 76] We are not doing so.

[501. 92-502. 88] Geely Motor last year. [503. 04-504. 24] It is 20% of its car factory. [504. 40-506. 64] It is also a car factory with great market growth. [506. 80-507. 44] It sells very well. [507. 60-509. 28] In particular, it is said that it has several cars. [509. 44-510. 72] Specially it is the current jickey.

[510. 88-512. 56] A few days later, Jick was talking about it. [512. 72-514. 16] It was his car to go first. [514. 32-516. 16] To sell a million goodies. [516. 32-517. 76] It was probably more than four million. [517. 92-519. 20] It was to kill Land Rover. [519. 36-521. 76] For example, some brands in mainland China.

[521.2 92-523. 36] In fact, it is very ambitious. [523. 52-526. 24] But these are egregious. [526. 40-527. 60] Because we are in China. [527. 76-530. 08] Of course, the manufacturers are these big manufacturers. [530. 24-5332. 64] Like egregious, like a sign. [533. 04-536. 24]

[536. 40-538. 48] Take a car from Hong Kai leader. [538. 64-539. 60] is the Great Wall again. [539. 76-542. 64] The car before the Great Wall is Daan factory of the tug of the dog. [542. 80-543. 44] The Big Tu dog. [543. 60-545. 84] Because the Big Tu dog sold 230,000 units a month. [546. 00-547. 20] It is also amazing.

[547. 36-549. 28] It is like Chang An Ford. [549. 44-550. 24] Ford has a brand with a joint venture in it. [550. 40-554. 32] Chang An Ford has a brand inside it. [554. 48-555. 76] So look at this. [555. 92-561. 04] It means that we are working with a joint venture in Jiangsu. [561. 04-565. 44] In fact, the whole situation was just said last year.

[565. 60-568. 08] Last year, it grew to 87 HUD. [568. 24-572. 48] The total market trading volume reached nearly 47,8 million units. [572. 64-573. 92] It was nearly 500,000 units. [574. 08-579. 12] The market share of 500,000 units should be about 45%. [579. 28-582. 48] is also a vehicle with HUD installed in mainland China. [582. 64-585. 76] It contains 14% and 15%.

[585. 92-587. 04] It is very popular. [587. 20-590. 56] Of course, most of this side may be Japanese brand. [590. 56-592. 56] It is a joint venture brand of cars. [592. 72-595. 52] Other may be that we are competing with other industries. [595. 68-598. 08] This is the case. [598. 24-601. 76] The whole mainland of China had a HUD-mounted car last year.

[601. 92-604. 64] is about the share of the entire market. [604. 80-605. 92] is about 13%. [606. 08-608. 48] is the car of 30 million units. [608. 64-611. 84] There are about 3 million units with HUD installed. [612. 00-615. 28] of them are about 47 million units with our home. [615. 44-616. 72] is probably full of this.

[616. 88-618. 16] I tweeted to Guo Wu. [618. 32-620. 40] This year the mainland car will not actually grow. [620. 56-624. 96] This year China self-owned brand sales. [625. 12-628. 00] I think it will continue to grow. [628. 16-629. 52] Because from the first and second quarters, [629. 68-632. 56] In fact, the whole joint venture brand decline is even more serious.

[63. 72-635. 36] The whole self-owned brand actually grew higher. [635. 52-636. 96] And just that trend is more obvious. [637. 12-639. 76] That the main car sales are really good. [639. 92-643. 60] But the manufacturers behind it are actually slowly lagging behind. [643. 76-648. 88] So this year we're planning to sell the whole HUD in 2025. [649. 04-650. 40]

[650. 56-653. 60] is still a very optimistic expectation. [653. 76-655. 44] Of course it is currently. [655. 60-658. 88] It is the only internal examination of mainland China, of course. [659. 04-660. 64] It is actually from last year. [660. 80-662. 48] Although we say it internal examination. [662. 64-6664. 40] Of course we are still in that growth.

[66. 56-667. 04] But in fact, it is from our financial measures. [667. 20-668. 40] The process of internal check-up is actually a process. [668. 56-671. 60] In fact, our gross profit has slowly risen in recent years. [671. 76-674. 72] That is, in this internal check-up process. [674. 88-676. 16] We have found a solution. [676. 32-679. 68] We have found a way to balance our costs with our currency.

[680. 56-682. 80] is another part of Thailand. [682. 96-688. 56] The Thai market is a relatively important place for our development in recent years. [688. 72-690. 16] Because Thailand has been in recent years. [690. 32-693. 76] Of course, Thailand's main production is to the Japanese brand of the car factory. [693. 92-696. 24] Of course, the country's Toyota is the largest. [696. 40-697. 52] In fact, Toyota is the largest.

[697. 68-699. 76] We are currently handing over the whole Toyota group. [699. 92-704. 24] About 35% of the cars are handing over to Toyota. [704. 40-705. 76] All are handing over to TOYOTA. [705. 92-710. 40] But Toyota is scattered all over the world. [710. 56-74. 96] We are following Thailand. [715. 12-720. 40] Mainly with TOYOTA, Mitsubishi, Mista, Honda, and Izu.

[720. 56-721. 92] These companies are traded. [722. 08-726. 16] Because the whole Southeast Asia is a Japanese-style product sales proportion is very high. [726. 32-727. 12] Very high. [727. 28-730. 48] Similar to Malaysia may be slightly lower than 0. [730. 64-734. 08] Similar to Thailand and Indonesia two main markets. [734. 24-735. 84] In fact, the proportion is more than 60%.

[736. 00-738. 40] In recent years, of course, I want to say. [738. 56-740. 32] 2024. [740. 56-746. 32] In fact, China's electric vehicles entered the Southeast Asian market. [746. 48-748. 88] accounted for the best year of the year. [749. 04-752. 48] Because China was in 2024. [752. 64-754. 88] In fact, it was probably part of the whole market aggression.

[755. 04-756. 96] It occupies about 10 percent. [757. 12-758. 64] That is, from the Japanese brand. [758. 80-760. 80] It takes about 10 percent of the forecast. [760. 96-764. 00] That is, the whole part of the original brand has declined. [764. 16-767. 60] And the whole car market in Southeast Asia. [767. 76-769. 52] It was actually after the second half of last year.

[769. 68-770. 48] This is actually the case. [770. 64-772. 88] The small stock market has almost doubled. [773. 04-776. 24] Because there may be some situation in the entire economy. [776. 40-778. 08] So the whole car sales have been reduced. [778. 24-779. 52] But the same. [779. 68-781. 20] I just said.

[781. 36-783. 52] China Taikoo is a recessioned market. [783. 68-786. 80] But overall our revenue has grown by 10%. [786. 96-788. 72] For example, the whole Southeast Asian market. [788. 88-789. 92] In fact, last year was 10%. [790. 08-791. 04] That's why I did this. [791. 20-792. 64] Because I just mentioned it.

[792. 80-794. 88] Because of its competition in mainland China. [795. 04-797. 92] In fact, it is brought to us by this group of capitals. [798. 08-799. 28] Or Lido's information. [800. 56-801. 84] It is often. [802. 00-803. 12] Is a lot of information. [803. 28-804. 16] How often.

[804. 32-806. 80] Because it is for it. [806. 96-809. 28] In fact, it is facing a cost competition. [809. 44-810. 64] It is required. [810. 80-812. 32] Because it is from the previous days brand. [812. 48-816. 40] In fact, it is critical of its suppliers' choice. [816. 56-819. 76] Most of them are actually concentrated in its original supply system.

[819. 92-823. 28] is the supplier of its system in Japan. [823. 44-828. 24] is the characteristic of its system in Japan. [828. 44-828. 24] is a low cost development high development cycle. [828. 40-829. 60] Because it is actually possible. [829. 76-830. 48] is a member of the ranks of Japan. [830. 64-831. 84] is a certain specification.

[832. 00-834. 00] So the flexibility of its people may not be high. [834. 16-836. 40] coupled with the possibility of our factory. [836. 56-841. 12] In fact, our supply behind us actually chooses a lot. [841. 28-842. 88] Our selection is a lot. [843.0 04-845. 20] So we can apply a lot of solutions. [845. 36-846. 72] Let it be a choice.

[846. 88-847. 92] So it is more valuable. [848. 08-850. 80] It costs much more than us. [850. 96-852. 56] But for Japanese manufacturers. [852. 72-857. 16] It picks its non-Japanese suppliers. [856.6 32-857. 44] It is also very difficult. [857. 60-859. 36] So it is only possible to pick it first.

[859. 52-860. 48] was originally a factory in Japan. [860. 64-863. 12] was handed over to its non-Japanese suppliers.

We are in the first row. So we are in the daytime brand. This is what we get. In fact, in the last few years the brand is in quality.

It doesn't give us a global order like a car host in the past. Now it also gives us a global order for the car. Global orders are currently targeted for certain cars. There are times when some cars have money to order us. What is this definition?

The sound of a car that we used to hand over to Southeast Asia. Maybe only hand over to Southeast Asia. I developed a product that cost about 20 million. Can only hand over to Southeast Asia. Now I have the opportunity to hand over to the world. The volume of the world is huge.

The volume of the world has grown. That's why. The whole transaction has grown. The second is that the depth of the entire item has also increased. The depth has increased. In the past, it began to do for us from the camera.

That's what the camera does for us. Next, do it for the camera. Camera, camera. Next, do the reverse camera. Next, do the link.

So in fact, there are more and more things we can do here in the world than we do now. In the past, people talked about how much power you have in the market.

Our market across Southeast Asia. Get the market value of a Japanese order. It's less than a ring value. That's less than 5% of our assets. It's about 5%. It's actually more powerful now.

Every percentage is growing. We are actually jumping. 5% of what we are talking about right now. Last year, we were about 2 billion people in Southeast Asia. If a percentage jumps, it's about 2 billion people a month or more.

So with it for the future. It keeps us on making orders like this every year. This is going to be a long time in the future. In fact, there will be a continuing fermentation effect. Direct fermentation effect. This is part of the daily system.

But the Southeast Asian part is not just part of the day. There is another case. We are also slowly developing the two-wheel market. Why we are going to do the two-wheel market. Not that you may not do the two-wheeler, but rather the two-wheeler and the four-wheeler.

"We have two things in common, and we have two things in common, and we have two things in common, and we have two things in common, and we have two things in common," he said, "and we have two things in common," he said, "and we have two things in common."

Just like the two of us now are. The Kawasaki, Ducati, Triumph. That's the kind of heavy locomotive. You see Ducati and Triumph. They buy a heavy locomotive for four and five million. So it's a little bit about it.

It is a high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality.

Now we have some opportunities. It's a good way to go. It's a good way to go. It's a way to go. It's a good way to start making two rounds of products. Two rounds of products, of course, so far.

We have begun to have this delivery time. Except after the two rounds of market driving. In fact, we have more opportunities to come in, because now we have a very public situation in our mobile phone. We are more and more modes of transportation.

Many vehicles. In fact, it is necessary to connect with your phone. So there are many special vehicles in the market. In fact, it extends the need for automotive automation products.

It is like a palm tree, like a palm tree, like a palm tree, and like a palm tree, like a palm tree.

In fact, it's not much of a discovery for what we've developed. In the future, we have so many opportunities for value conversions. In addition to this, there are other opportunities for development here in Thailand.

The market is doing the Indian market. Because in recent years, India has been one. It can be defined so far. India is one of the world's most developing potentials. But it also has many challenges. It also has challenges.

And on the Day of Resurrection, no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least, nor will any soul be wronged in the least.

It's like we're currently in the Burry industry in India. In fact, we've set up one of our research and development offices there. We're currently working with the whole factory. For example, we're working with Tata, because it's already shipped.

In addition, we have developed in recent years, because of the entire Indian market. Apart from Tata. There is Izu. There is Toyota there is also a lot of development.

So as long as you have a factory there. In fact, you can quickly bridge it to the future. In this stage of the development of automobile currency. One of the entire product development into it. This will be a big part of the future. Of course, we are currently trading with India.

There is no charge for the goods to be shipped to Thailand, and there is no charge for the goods to be shipped to Thailand.

There is no such thing as a good idea, so at least we're working on it right now.

First, control under a relatively stable situation. Therefore, we should pay attention to the whole of Thailand. There are many future developments in the wellness point. So other things it is for a long time. This year may be more stable to see these things.

Basically, it will lay down the future for many years. In fact, this year may be slightly. Make the whole group slightly stable. Each corresponds.

Innovation is what you can expect from new products. In fact, we are in the middle of the mainland China and are constantly introducing 3D products. 3D is definitely our world's first. So far, no one has done it. Of course, we are talking about this part of our 3D technology already matured in the second year.

There is no chance of mass production in China. You see that there is no chance of mass production in China this year. Then another side of Europe, there are actually several major manufacturers in Europe. Especially in recent years, there is a difference between 3D and 3D. The concept of HUD is that when your image is projected is on your front brain glass, so what you see is like this information is outside your car.

The second is more advanced called AIHUD, which is called Extended Time HUD. The extended time HUD means that its information will be combined with your road conditions, that is, when you turn or when you see that you want to tell you that there is a traffic warning in front of you, it will tell you which direction it is. So when you drive in the navigation, it will follow its route is to turn past, rather than say that I turn right, it is my right turn to give it its own connection.

For example, the closer you see an object today, the more you see it, the closer you will get to it. It will have a concept of space there, and 3D should be a better application. That's what we are saying right now is that our products in China, although just said that the Chinese side of the country is very windy, but you are about to develop a new product in the process of this roll. Our idea is, of course, to roll to the market now, at least we have the market to take the first place, the market share is familiar with these guests, you will have the opportunity to transform it into 3D.

In addition to the European brands outside of China, this is the general certification of the manufacturer. Every year these flowers actually cost a lot of money, these money is the part of the ability to maintain your technical ability. In addition to just so much, and then redefine our products, our company's products are called HUD, Infotainment, Adas and Accessories.

These three products are actually ours, and you may have already bought your car out of the car brand three or four years ago. But in the past from the point of view of the manufacturer to provide the download, there are currently no consumers, few. In recent years, it has been slowly discovered that some manufacturers began to provide electronic mirrors, like some cars in Japan, such as Nissan also began to provide electronic mirrors, and the factory also began to provide car recorders.

In the future, there will be a good premise of development, because there will be another defense, and it will not be too much extra investment for our development. So much more and see how the market will be redefined. Before the mainland market enters and exits, it is as long as the manufacturing of combustion and joint venture marketing, the traditional WHUT, ND, new things have 3E and POCs, Southeast Asia and India, and two rounds of calls, in fact, our new development. Europe is in addition to the 3E, there is a PH5D product development, this opening is actually in the convergence, the public information station to get it, this is a road map of our whole 3D.

After this year, HUT really did a good job, the market share of China is very short is 4, and of course, Europe is urgent to explore it in the future. So HUT is probably the case, I believe the future of HUT is still a product with a very developmental interest. Enterprises like China, it is currently about 3, you see Taiwan we really don't have. Would you say that the future of electric vehicles need HUT?

Market electric vehicles instead need HUT, why? Because they don't need to do anything when driving, but they still pay attention to the road. Because so far, our driving responsibility for electric cars is not the owner of the car. If today's driving responsibility is the car owner, it's actually the car. But so far, it's not the car.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to confirm the timestamp and content of each sentence. Then, I need to group these sentences according to logical and contextual relationships to form a coherent paragraph. For example, parts of HUT and 3D products may need to be merged, while parts of AI applications and smart cabins need to be integrated. Next, pay attention to the correct arrangement of timestamps to ensure that each sentence is accurate.

In addition, the term "HUT", "3D", "AI" and other terms referred to by the user need to remain the same and can not be changed. At the same time, the part involved in financial data and market analysis should be particularly careful to ensure the accuracy of the figures and percentages. During the processing process, I will compare the data to make sure that nothing is missing. For example, the sales situation and data in different regions of the Chinese market need to be arranged in chronological order and maintain the independence of each data point while making the overall paragraph more readable.

The following is the collated paragraph verbatim transcription (keep all the original sentences in full, adjust only the paragraph structure). You are responsible for driving after driving or your driver. Since the driver has to pay attention to the road conditions. Pay attention to the road conditions.

How do I know what is going on in my car? How do I know what is going on in your car? How do I know what is going on in your car?

Now you have all kinds of functional interventions. That's what HUT is doing. You can do it here. So HUT will be popularized for future electric vehicles or self-driving cars. And there are some. Because the current market share is a bit smaller.

That electric vehicle is HUT's hometown. Because it is electric vehicle, it is very simple. So it will emphasize more technology connotation. So it is more willing to put HUT to increase its connotation. Like several brands in mainland China.

This 3D thing is just mentioned. It emphasizes what we have independently developed. But in the future, it is our hope that our 3D product can be slowly replaced by ours in the market.

It is a simple strategy, because 3D Maori is good for us, and it is not a competition for the market, and if a person enters, they have the opportunity to take advantage of the market advanced.

That's what we're going to do next. We're really all about the SmartCabin right now. It's the concept of smartcabin. It's slowly formed. It's probably a vehicle in the smartcab. You'll think we're a vehicle in the smartcab.

In the future, it will also be slowly re-infiltrated with AI. Because there is actually a Huawei that has already opened the continent before. They are not a few platforms. Is AI being implemented through D-Sync already? In fact, such a solution is already in use in Cabaret. Cabaret part has been implemented through the original Apple Intelligent.

Start slowly introducing a new AI application. So its AI application goes up and down. In fact, the whole smart cabin needs in the future. It will be bigger. That is to say, I'll give you an example.

"Today you will be with me in Paradise, and we will be with you in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise, and you will be with us in Paradise."

For example, if we go down the path to the Shek Mun Reservoir, our path may be similar, but in the future it may be different. Why? Because it has your habit of being here on your edge.

It knows how you use it. And there is an image of your value. It will follow your part to bring you into the environment that is best for you. So everyone is going to have something more restrained here. This is what is called an energy of AI. Especially you can talk to him in the middle of the night.

I may have to buy something. Then I'll go back. He'll be there right away. So his conversation will be friendly. For example, isn't it hard to talk in the car in the past? Have you ever used BlackSiri and OK Google?

But in the AI, it's like chatting with him. Don't have too many commands back in the chat with him. Use the chat with him to give you information. Of course, his phone is in the car. There are two ways to do it.

One way is that he built-in SIM card inside the car. One way is to use your phone's SIM card directly. There are two ways. There are two ways. Of course, there may be a higher security requirement for information security.

When I went out of the car, my information was taken away, so we talked about it, but we could all be developed according to the time of consumption.

You may be able. You should be able to connect by looking at the car through your mobile phone. It is earlier because we have been driving for a long time, and you know that there is always TOMTOM. There are a lot of that kind of PMD product.

Now that you are driving, you should basically use Google. Or Cowboy. In fact, the whole product development has become very simple. After that, it will be much more integrated. He is now starting to integrate some of the information in the car.

So the car host is a very big thing. It's a very core thing. For example, you have mastered the car host. You have mastered the entire smart cabin right. This is a back seat entertainment system. It's just a little look at our products.

This is a rearview mirror. It is a car seat. It is a car seat that does that DVI. It may have a function of remote monitoring inside. It is a radio charging board. Let's talk about what we have seen in recent years.

Our car sales situation. Because we still have the main market, we will take the main market situation to explain it to you. This is how we deal with our growth situation. In fact, this year's February to look at the contrast. Red is last year.

Actually, it's a little bit higher than last year. But last December's numbers are a little bit slower than last year's. But last year's numbers were a little bit smaller than last year's December. However, it's still a little higher than last year's December. Below we'll keep an eye on it again.

It can be said that it has so far been the atmosphere of the entire market. Then again, Thailand. The main focus of Thailand so far is January this year. It has only received the number of January at the moment. It has not yet received in February. But the number of January has declined slightly slightly compared to last year.

And it came to pass, [that] the word of the LORD came unto us, saying, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto one of the least of these, unto the least of these, unto the least of these, unto the least of these.

This is a situation from the previous year. Maori was 29. 44% in the fourth quarter of total market. Then it was our fee. The fee was slightly slow. I told you before. We started to slow.

But comparison. The emphasis is to look at it. Because our costs are relatively relevant to future cases. There is no correlation to current sales. It may be representative. The first development of our HUD has entered a relatively mature harvesting period.

So we have less investment in HUD, but there is a discount, because there are other new projects to do.

In the past, the trend of the future will continue to be a little more stable. Because the development of HUD in the past is very high amount, in fact, the 3D has been almost almost, now is waiting for the harvest. This stock surplus of course, there are 0.998, let's take a look at this year's situation in January and February. Remember that 1, February is still growing compared to last year, but if you say that from last year, it looks like a little bit, but if you're against the trend of the automaker, it's a little bit like that.

This trend is almost the same because our company's growth is basically the same as the acquisition of the car market, just that we are a little or better than the car the whole finishing market, because of the transparency problem. Although the car market is decreasing, but the transparency of the product we installed is increasing, which means that we can take it, which is a proportion of ours. So this year's revenue to the present is certainly a place or a group, or there is a growth of 22. 86% so far, so far this year, it is about 48% and 54% growth.

This is a growth situation of the whole product, so far, the advanced value is a little weak, but the car host is a lot, growth 66%. The other classes are the other classes I just said, and the other classes are now slowly stronger, maybe we have increased this year, because the other categories of revenue is too close, other categories of revenue is relatively high, about 30% or more. OK, that is a Taiwan's revenue product, take a look, this is Jiangsu, actually Jiangsu is mainly concentrated HUD, this is this, this is Thailand's brand, Thailand, because there are many others are concentrated in Thailand, just formed a record, can not see what he did with you, this is probably what I want to do from here, then I want to leave you, to see if there are any problems want to interact with, good, OK.
