<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user-provided rules carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will look at the verbatim fragments provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these chronological sentences into coherent paragraphs while keeping the original order and content of each sentence. It is important to note that some sentences may have jumps in timestamps, such as the missing part in the middle, for example [28. 80-29. 44] Hello, this may mean there is a time interval after [19. 50-21. 60], but the user requests do not delete anything, so all sentences, so all sentences must keep all sentences.

For example, in the section [59. 44-63. 80], the user refers to "I'm not open", which may be an error or technical problem, but must keep the original story. Similarly, subsequent apologies and repeats also need to be retained as well. In the organizational paragraph, I will consider the logical coherence of sentences and combine sentences into paragraphs of the same topic. For example, on the corporate part of corporate governance, from [116. 40-117. 56] to [157. 44-160. 96], these sentences can be combined into a paragraph that illustrates different aspects of corporate governance. At the same time, the financial information section, such as [228. 32-231. 88] to [343. 12-344. 16], also needs to be coherent, to ensure the interpretation of financial data is clear.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the repeated sentences, such as "Our customers are also very important" repeated four times, must be kept all the time, cannot be combined or deleted. This may be because the speaker emphasizes the importance of the customer, so it must be repeated many times, so it must be presented truthfully. In the process, also pay attention to the order of timestamps correctly, to ensure that the sequence of paragraphs conforms to the natural process of the speech. For example, the opening greetings, the introduction of guests, corporate governance, financial information, industry differences, etc. should be arranged in chronological order, but the user requests do not follow the timestamps, but the content logic section, so it is necessary to organize according to the content theme.

The following is the compiled paragraph verbatim transcription (totally preserved, undeleted, rewritten or condensed): We welcome all our guests today to the Yuanta Securities First Quarter Investment Forum. Today's forum is specially invited to explain to us the Chief Financial Officer of Huiyang Shipping, Xue Yijun, and let's warmly welcome everyone. [28. 80-29. 44] [29. 44-31. 44] Thank you all for joining us. [31. 44-34. 20]

[34. 20-36. 84] So today. [36. 84-39. 00] We are the same for the provincial sector. [39. 00-40. 44] will target the company. [40. 44-42. 62] The industry will talk to everyone about it. [42. 62-44. 20] That is in the process. [44. 20-45. 64] If you have any questions.

[45. 64-47. 20] Or something unknown. [47. 20-48. 22] Do not be polite. [48. 22-49. 12] Anyone can ask. [49. 12-50. 76] Because the provincial industry is a bit different. [50. 76-53. 22] and other industries are a bit different. [53. 22-55. 28] So everyone has a different understanding of the industry.

[55. 28-57. 18] Those who are not circumcised. [57. 18-57. 52]. [57. 52-58. 80] Okay. [59. 44-63. 80] I did not. [63. 80-64. 32] Sorry. [64. 32-64. 76] I did not.

[64. 76-65. 44] I'm not open. [65. 44-67. 20] I'm waiting. [67. 20-67. 68] Okay. [67. 68-68. 52] Today we're going to cover three main sections, the first is about our company's Huiyang shipping, and the second is about some of the conditions and features of the provincial government's shipping industry, and the third is about our current business strategy.

So sometimes people ask what is the difference between the provincial and provincial government industry transport company can make a lot of difference between each other, but I think we Huiyang shipping company may be in the corporate governance, there is our application strategy, and our attention to volume is relatively different. When it comes to corporate governance, the company is what people do, so even if the ship runs at sea, the cargo is almost these, but different people will create a different corporate culture environment. So we also attach great importance to this, although he himself is an entrepreneur, that is the largest shareholder of the current company, he thinks that the composition of the board is very important, so our five members of the board of directors are independent directors, so most of them have economic, fast legal aspects.

In addition to our board performance, we also attach great importance to our regular operations team, because the shipping industry is facing international business, so no matter what happens on our ship, our customers are also very important, so our customers are also very important, our customers are also very important, our customers are also very important, our customers are also very important, and our customers are also very important. So for us, regardless of the internationalization of our team, it is very important to be able to grasp and deal with problems quickly.

So you see generally, we have a seasonal, February is also relatively low, so we should be relatively low in February, but last year the situation is a little different, but last year the situation is a little different, but by the end of the year the situation is a little lower, we will share with you a little. We also have a share, it is the current financial information, and then the first month of the year we are going down the low level last year, so this year is also the first month of last year the year has gone down, so we actually see the market has started to rebound in the middle of February, so we want to see a relatively normal gross profit situation in March.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. So the boat type affects what is on the ship. When we look at the boat type, we mainly talk about his shield. The shield is the largest, more than 20 million shields. His max, the early 67,000 shields, now about 8,000 shields, eighty-eight to eighty-eight. So the supermax, the early may be only 56,68, and the mainstream should now be about sixty-four.

So handy size is also slowly large, but it's about two times, and about thirty-seven, thirty-eight is now mainstream. So small handy, which is below normal handy, may be less than twenty-eight. Generally speaking, it's an informal ship type, and it's a small handy. So why do you say that the shield will cause the difference in the size of the cargo? The first one is different from the port, because the size of the ship that each port can rely on is a little different. The second one is also different from the amount of each shipment, like the freshwater river valley, it's a lot of hundreds of thousands of tons of ton ships, and it's hundreds of millions of tons of ton ships to queue.

But there are times when you're carrying rice, where there's so much to load, so there's no such thing as so much to carry, so there's no way for anyone to rent a cape to carry the rice. At least I've never heard of the crystal, so this is what caused him to carry the goods. Then there's no difference between the equipment on board and the equipment on board. Generally speaking, Caveside and Panamax are the two types of ships, and there are no suspensions on board, and then there are suspensions on Supermax. So what's the difference between the suspension levers?

This is the case, so it is simple to say that ships with levers can be loaded, and if there is no levers, it is necessary to rely on the equipment on the shore to load the work, so it will cause a difference. So the only thing I want to say is that it is related to the goods, some goods, so that the cement of water bubbles, coal pulp, etc., his goods are very simple, so there is no problem with Conveyor conveyor. If there is time for large engines, such as the fan of wind power, can you use Conveyor to load?

In fact, it may be because they are operating a different type of ship, which we will talk about a little more about the different types of ship market performance. Then we just talk about because the ship type is different, then we are more concerned about what is more, the board member's habits, or the company culture, what you can see is that the ship type everyone invests less.

But this is a situation that has just happened in the bulk shipping industry. So by dispersing the different types of ships, we think that this can be better to disperse the risks, then we can also build a more comprehensive fleet, and our tenants have a more complete cooperation, so this is the reason why we do different types of ships, so some investors may ask, and that strange other people won't do so. This is a strategic problem, because large ships, larger ships, the larger ships, in fact, it carries goods, the smaller ships, the smaller ships, the more fixed ships, so it's better to manage, but it's more expensive, so it's more risky.

This is in fact the Q1 to Q3 last year, because the annual report has ended, but not every company has closed, so we do not want to throw out then a lot of empty, not interesting. So here is the first to three quarters last year, for you to reference. So I think we should all be reasonable in all aspects of the performance, while our return is also relatively large. Just with you to report that our company's business situation, in fact, is a very delicate structure, in fact, the bulk ship is a division of labor, is a delicate industry, some companies it is just an investment boat, it is only an asset owner, it does not manage, what it does not do, it is is an investment ship, on the right is a return, sometimes even the ship is a way to rent back, it is to pay a return, and this ship owner also.

There are some ship owners who say that I do more and manage the money I also want to earn, that the money management on the one hand is that it requires some experience is very fusion, on the other hand, it takes some risk, so different market positioning with it is different risk is different, with it takes different risks is there, with it takes different risks is different risk is there, with

This is why we have a relatively large impact on revenues. Of course, that is why if the market goes up, that is a bit different. In addition, we are operating the entire fleet, and there is a small one, especially when the market is getting better, because we do not have a large number of ships in our own fleet, and now we are only about 50, and they are small, then they are very old, because our average age is about 8 years, so the ship is about 12.4 is relatively old, and most of them are about a short distance.

So, in 2024, we gave a total of four new ships, and we also saw that compared to last year's overall margin was 33. 31, our new ships reached 53. 51, so there is a pretty good gap. So why is there such a gap? The first is because the new boat is also better to rent, so the renter is more likely to get some premiums than the renter; the second is because we created the new boat in 2024, three years ago, this 2021 is actually a relatively high shipping price, so we think that 2024 is also a cost advantage. So in the past year, most of the new ships would be higher than the overall margin, so this is a very important motivator for our company to continue to build a new boat, because we found that the new ship is very efficient, especially after the next one is more important, I think it is a necessity in strategy.

It is important to understand that this is not the case, because we can all share the price change later, because the cost of the ship is increasing, so we are the most appropriate time, but also need some observations. We change the deal is actually a very important part of our fixed rent, I want to tell you first, because in fact, we have a fixed axis, our company slides as much as a fixed template, so that you can follow up with this investor friend, so that you can see what I said two years ago, it is similar to template. It is not important to change the deal, because we fixed a contract, when the exchange is a gain or decline, it really has a big impact on our revenue. Now, because the majorly return comes from the index link, so you don't have to ask me when the contract changes, because the index links will change. But we' will change it all over again.

If you are looking for the best prices for your property, you may be looking for the best price for your property, but if you are looking for a good price for your property, you may be looking for the best price for your property. If you are looking for a good price for your property, this is the best price for your property. If you are looking for a good price for your property, this is the best price for your property. If you are looking for a good price for your property, this is the best price for your property. If you are looking for a good price for your property, this is the best price for your property.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. This freight is increased. [1505. 52-1507. 32] This freight is increased. [1507 32-1510. 32] But if the material increase is from demand rise. [1510. 32-1510. 52] Ah. [1510. 52-1511. 48] We all know.

[1511. 48-1513. 32] Because of the rising price there are two kinds. [1513. 32-1514. 76] One is this inner break. [1514. 76-1518. 16] This is the relationship that is supply supply supply. [1518. 16-1520. 36] If the demand is reduced, the price rises. [1520. 36-1522. 04] This is not good for us.

[1523. 68-1525. 92] But if it is due to the increase in demand. [1525. 92-1527. 00] The price has been promoted. [1527. 00-1528. 16] It is good for us. [1528. 16-1529. 36] This is generally the case. [1529. 36-1530. 44] So this is what we are talking about first. [1530. 44-1533. 20]

[1533. 20-1534. 08] Landscape cycles. [1534. 08-1535. 48] is for the concept. [1535. 48-1536. 48] This is a little bit like this. [1536. 48-1537. 72] Traditionally, that is. [1537. 72-1539. 04] A relatively common landscape cycle. [1539. 04-1540. 96] We are all following family holidays.

[1540. 96-1543. 72] So most of the Chinese Lunar Year is not bad. [1543. 72-1544. 44-1545. 84] Summer vacation is probably not good. [1545. 84-1550. 00] This is a relatively approximate er. [1550. 00-1551. 04] The climax cycle. [1551. 04-1552. 12] Because the holidays are not good.

[1552. 12-1553. 84] This is somewhat similar to the capital market. [1553. 84-1555. 08] is the issue. [1555. 08-1557. 08] IPO no one on the lunar year. [1557. 08-1558. 84] Then Christmas or summer vacation. [1558. 84-1560. 56] is similar. [1560. 56-1561. 32] Of course.

[1561. 32-1562. 76] From last year's words to the present. [1562. 76-1564. 76] We are now more interested in the industry. [1564. 76-1565. 56] Situation. [1565. 56-1568. 28] There are still a few recent cases of misunderstanding. [1568. 28-1569. 56] Happy mid-term projects. [1569. 56-1572. 12] I think it is worth to help us.

[1572. 12-1574. 16] The first is the changes in U.S. economic policy. [1574. 16-1577. 36] That's why we actually talk about last year. [1577. 36-1578. 92] The low season is not light. [1578. 92-1579. 96] But not really. [1580. 00-1581. 60] Relatively speaking. [1581. 60-1583. 24] The activity is gradually decreasing.

[1583. 24-1584. 00] Then. [1584. 00-1585. 84] Summer vacation is not very light. [1585. 84-1587. 00] But, well. [1587. 00-1588. 80] After the summer vacation did not run up. [1588. 80-1590. 32] Also dropped down. [1590. 32-1590. 88] Why.

[1590. 88-1594. 08] We feel that the United States is actually uncertain. [1594. 08-1596. 88] Political uncertainty can be a savvy factor. [1596. 88-1598. 32] That's because President Trump. [1598. 32-1601. 36] He said that this gentleman's business was in the election period. [1601 36-1602. 12] And even more and more. [1602. 12-1607. 04] People also worry about these related factors such as the subsequent tariff trade.

[1607. 04-1608. 24] In particular. [1608. 24-1608. 88] U.S. [1608. 88-1609. 84] U.S.A. [1609. 84-1611. 64] Such duties or trade policies. [1611. 64-1615. 08] There is a certain degree of influence on the investment of exporters. [1615. 08-1616. 20] So uh.

[1616. 20-1619. 56] Today you should not strengthen your investment in Mexico. [1619. 56-1621. 56] Don't strengthen your investment in Canada. [1621. 56-1623. 60] This is a very important key. [1623. 60-1624. 48] You probably know that. [1624. 48-1626. 88] Some companies should invest directly in the United States. [1626. 88-1628. 32] This is also a practice.

[1628. 32-1629. 68] But. [1629. 68-1631. 68] I don't know where to invest. [1631. 68-1634. 72] In fact, it is an influence on the provincial boat market. [1634. 72-1635. 28] Because [1635. 28-1639. 48] We're actually running a lot of things related to the formation of fixed capital. [1639. 48-1640. 52] Like these cements.

[1640. 52-1642. 16] Such as steel. [1642. 16-1643. 96] This raw material. [1643. 96-1647. 12] It is actually related to the construction of the production line. [1647. 12-1648. 12] Machine equipment. [1648. 12-1651. 44] This is also the goods carried by the provincial government. [1651. 44-1652. 40] Such things.

[1652. 40-1653. 44] It has a relationship with the mobile allocation investment of the detective line. [1656. 76-1661. 88] It is a relatively uncertain situation in an economic situation. [1661 88-1662. 40] Yes. [1662. 40-1665. 12] Generally speaking, there is no good news for the provincial vessels. [1665. 12-1669. 36] So we think one of the first half of the year to the second half.

[1669. 48-1670. 48] The landscape is down. [1670. 48-1673. 40] There is little economic stability with the United States. [1673. 40-1674. 20] There is a relationship. [1674. 20-1676. 04] We all think it is impossible to predict. [1676. 04-1678. 40] There is no better way to predict it now. [1678. 40-1679. 08] It is difficult to say.

[1679. 08-1693. 84] But at least everyone is a market is a decision to make. [1683. 84-1684. 84] So that's it. [1684. 84-1688. 04] We have seen very few changes in the landscape from February. [1688. 04-1691. 44] I think this is only a reflection of the overall economy. [1691 44-1694. 28] or a expectation of the political situation. [1694. 28-1696. 88] It is also a feature of the market.

[1696. 88-1698. 64] Because the shipping is flashy. [1698. 64-1699. 08] You. [1699. 08-1701. 04] If you see him good. [1701-04-1702. 32] Overtime will fall. [1702. 32-1704. 32] Then you will fall too long. [1704. 32-1707. 64] So why after the pandemic, the Mariner.

[1707. 64-1709. 68] Why is it so good after the epidemic. [1709. 68-1712. 04] was not there for a while. [1712. 04-1716. 04] Finally, some of the trades needed to come back. [1716. 04-1717. 76] This transition period. [171717. 76-1720. 00] I actually think it will be a lot more. [1720. 00-1722. 04] It became a centralized hospital.

[1722. 04-1723. 04] That's the way it is for Shining Ships. [1723. 04-1725. 60] I have time to say a parable like a bento shop. [1725. 60-1728. 20] I'm the only bento shop that sells ten people. [1728. 20-1728. 52-1730. 80] If today is 11.30.

[1731. 80-1732. 48] That's not a problem. [1732. 48-1733. 96] went smoothly. [1733. 96-1736. 16] But today, if you're just good to everyone. [1736. 16-1737. 60] It's going to be 11 and a half in France. [1737. 60-1739. 32] It's not going out. [1739. 32] They're all crowded at 12 o'clock.

[1741. 24-1742. 72] There are 150 people there. [1742. 72-1744. 36] The bento shop is closed. [1744. 36-1746. 36] Of course, the normal bento shop will call you to line up. [1746. 36-1749. 52] Some of the bento shops like our shimmering bento shop will call you for a price. [1749. 52-1751. 56] When the price is high, some people will ask for a price. [1751. 56-1753. 76] So we feel this price hike.

[1753. 76-1775. 44] Concentration of transportation needs like this. [1757. 44-1758. 36] It really is related. [1758. 52-1761. 84] So it was not a while in court. [1761. 84-1764. 28] Sometimes we will see such a jump. [1764 28-1765. 80] Not absolutely. [1765. 80-1768. 12] So we see it like a financial tsunami.

[1768. 12-1771. 28] There is such a depression that lasts for a year or two. [1771. 28-1774. 92] This is even something that will happen around 2015. [1774. 92-1777. 84] This is actually related to the excess capacity. [1777. 84-1779. 00] The excess capacity. [1779. 00-1781. 72] Because the excess capacity is transmitted. [1781.17-1782. 68] It may be that he will operate.

[1782. 68-1784. 92] His goal is to operate for twenty-five years. [1784. 92-1786. 08] He may not be able to do so for a long time. [1786. 08-1788. 28] But at least he may have at least fifteen years. [1788. 28-1789. 44] This surplus capacity. [1789. 44-1792. 36] He will burn low prices in the market. [1792. 36-1796. 00] So it was followed by the wave of the financial tsunami.

[1796. 00-1798. 32] This super cycle before the financial tsunami. [1798. 32-1801. 88] All because of China's relationship is very good. [1801 88-1804. 20] caused many shipyards to enter the market. [1804. 20-1806. 56] This wave after that is true. [1806. 56-1809. 00] Long-term is to digest these excessive production. [1809. 00-1811. 08] This is the condition of the shipyard.

[1811. 08-1813. 08] What we are talking about right now. [1813. 08-1814. 88] Our mid-to-long-term approach to production ships. [1814. 88-1816. 80] is considered to be relatively healthy and optimistic. [1816. 80-1817. 84] For this reason. [181818. 28-1819. 20] There is not much increase in ship capacity. [1819. 20-1820. 92] There is not much increase in ship capacity.

[1820. 92-1822. 36] So we feel in this case. [1822. 36-1823. 32] We feel healthy. [1823. 32-1825. 20] The so-called health is what we should do. [1825. 20-1827. 00] Expect a normal climatic cycle. [1827. 00-1830. 08] Do not say that there is a low burn. [1830. 08-1831. 36] Because the capacity is too high.

[1831. 36-1832. 96] You have to say very little about the reduction. [1832. 96-1835. 40] There are some factors that can cause this to happen. [1835. 40-1838. 80] The one we will share with you later. [1838. 80-1839. 60] That's why. [1839. 60-1841. 72] We want the industry to return to the industrial situation. [1841. 72-1843. 44]

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided to see how to make a reasonable segmentation while maintaining the correct mapping of the timestamp.

First of all, there are multiple timestamps and corresponding sentences in verbatim scripts. The user wants to group these sentences logically into paragraphs, but each sentence must be kept as it should be. I need to identify the beginning and end of each topic, such as about US economic policies, the impact of China's economy, international political issues, etc. Each topic may need to be a separate section, while paying attention to the continuity of the timestamp.

At the same time, note that the term "province ship" mentioned by the user may be a term that needs to be kept as it is, without any modification. During the processing process, I need to ensure that the sentences in each paragraph are arranged in chronological order and logically coherent. For example, on the part of the Chinese economy, from "because China is currently speaking" to "affecting the industries of the province ship", these sentences should form a paragraph that illustrates the impact of the Chinese economy on the province's ship.

When dealing with this part of the content, make sure that the relevant sentences are grouped correctly, for example, from "So I think this is a double-thirds" to "This is not so fast", these sentences should form a paragraph that discusses the possibility and challenge of rebuilding. It should also be noted that the format of the timestamps is correct, for example, there are spaces or symbols in some timestamps that need to be kept as they are. For example, "[1843. 44-1846. 20]" format must be preserved and cannot be modified. During the conversion process, there may be connection problems between some sentences, such as "So This" transition phrase, need to ensure the natural connection between the paragraphs. At the same time, check whether there are missing sentences or timestamps to ensure that all content is included correctly.

At the same time, make sure that no personal opinion or rewrite is added, and that it is completely organized according to the user's requirements. [1843. 44-1846. 20] So the US economic policy is not stable. [1846. 20-1848. 24] Let everyone dare to invest. [1848. 28-1849. 88] This is certainly a problem.

[1849. 88-1851. 88] The second is the part of the Chinese economy. [1851. 88-1853. 56] Because China is currently speaking. [1853. 56-1856. 32] is still an important market for provincial vessels. [1856. 32-1858. 32] Imports a lot. [1858. 32-1859. 16] So it is. [1859. 16-1860. 80] The stability of the economy.

[1860. 80-1863. 04] In fact, there is still a certain degree of association with the governorship. [1863. 04-1865. 76] We feel like it is 2022. [1865. 76-1868. 16] There should be a wave after the outbreak. [1868. 16-1868. 92] The result is not a wave. [1868. 92-1871. 56] This has a relationship with one of China's economic actions. [1861. 56-1874. 12] In particular, other real estate developers.

[1874. 12-1876. 56] There have been times when some debt problems have been transmitted. [1878. 56-1878. 12] This is for this. [1878. 12-1881. 52] Confidence in the whole investment is also affected. [1881. 52-1882. 60] It started last year. [1882. 60-1885. 52] China has put forward many new corrections. [1885. 52-1887. 60] We are not sure.

[1887. 60-1899. 72] This effect. [1889. 72-1892. 04] But I think regardless of the effect. [1892. 04-1893. 36] The direction of China's economy. [1893. 36-1899. 04] This is also worth noting. [1898. 04-1899. 96] Those who believe have their own views.

[1903. 00-1905. 32] We have come to this with you. [1905. 32-1907. 36] This. [1907. 36-1907. 96] lecture [1908. 12-909. 92] The third part of the statement. [1909. 92-1913. 04] is a major international political corrective problem. [1913. 04-1915. 00] contains the Russian-Ukraine war with his war. [1915. 00-1916. 32] Then he first spoke of his war.

[1916. 32-1918. 20] Put a little fire in the fire. [1918. 20-1919. 60] He was trying to restore the Red Sea. [1919. 60-1920. 92] Not yet. [1920. 92-1923. 36] Because it turned out to be political. [1923. 36-1924. 12] Everyone shouted. [1924. 12-1924. 28]

[1924. 28-1925. 20] I heard no problem. [1925. 20-1926. 04] Turn flat. [1926. 04-1928. 20] The result just went away. [1928. 20-1930. 44] Do not dare to walk. [1930. 44-1931. 48] That's why. [1931. 48-1933. 76] They said that after his war was over.

[1933. 76-1935. 52] Is the opening of the Red Sea. [1935. 52-1936. 48] Flash industry is going to fall. [1936. 48-1937. 96] This is not seen. [1938. 12-1941. 28] Because most of the time the Red Sea can walk. [1941. 28-1942. 92] Of course, there is a time when the Red Sea cannot walk. [194.2. 92-1945. 28] causes ships to circumcise.

[1945. 28-1946. 32] So if you pass through after that. [1946. 32-1947. 08] You might think. [1947. 08-1947. 24] Ah. [1947. 24-1947. 76] It can go away. [1947. 76-1948. 76] Ok. [1948. 76-1948. 76] It's OK. [1948. 76-1951. 96] I think the market will slowly adjust the situation that can go back.

[1951. 96-1954. 76] We are not able to walk by the Red Sea to eat. [1954. 76-1957. 16] So we feel that this is more peaceful than his war. [1957. 16-1958. 72] We are very happy to see it. [1958. 72-1959. 76] It does not say wow. [1959. 76-1960. 76] The Red Sea can walk. [1960. 76-1961. 76] It is very sad.

[1961. 76-1964. 28] I don't need that kind of pessimism. [196. 28-1965. 96] Then another one will be more concerned. [1965. 96-966. 92] Is the Russian-Ukrainian War. [1966. 92-1968. 08] The Russian-Ukrainian War has also been fought for three years. [1968. 12-969. 20] After the general ceases. [1968. 20-1970. 52] What happens after the war.

[1970. 52-1973. 12] Then of course, when the Russian-Ukrainian war began. [1973. 12-1975. 04] There were several impacts on bulk. [1975. 04-1976. 04] The first one was. [1976. 04-1977. 84] The exports of grains decreased. [1977. 84-1981. 32] So Europe had to import grains from elsewhere. [1981. 32-1982. 48] A little winding.

[1983. 04-1983. 84] That is. [1983. 84-1986. 92] This is the entry point for the overall grain volume. [1986. 92-1989. 24] Could also be affected by some shocks. [1989. 52-1991. 48] That's okay. [1991. 48-1995. 24] There was no significant food crisis in the world for three years. [1995. 40-1997. 08] This is what caused the Black Sea.

[1997. 08-1998. 08] Also winding. [1998. 12-1999. 28] Or not. [1999. 28-2000. 44] There is no winding. [2000. 44-2002. 16] Because the Black Sea is not the main channel. [2002. 16-2005. 24] It is not possible to enter the Black Sea. [2005. 24-2007. 76] This has always happened.

[2007. 76-2010. 92] Now if there is a chance for the Russian-Ukraine war to cease. [2010. 92-2012. 12] Next, we say. [2012. 12-2015. 16] Perhaps this food will respond slowly to the property. [2015. 16-2017. 84] It is a question of reconstruction that we are more concerned about. [2017. 84-2020. 04] Because the post-disaster reconstruction will happen. [2020. 04-2020. 84] Disgusting.

[2022. 84-2024. 08] Post-disaster reconstruction is inevitable. [2024. 08-2026. 00] What we cannot judge right now is. [2026. 00-2027. 96] Time and scale problems. [2028. 12-2029. 72] When will this happen? [2029. 72-031. 28] How big will it be. [2031. 28-2033. 48] It is really hard to guess.

[2038. 32-2038. 92] What we can speculate on is that it must be rebuilt. [2035. 72-2037. 12] will use steel water. [2037. 12-2038. 32] Such things. [2038. 32-2038. 92] That's why. [2038. 92-041. 44] Especially in the case of many ports in Ukraine. [2041. 44-044. 40] How much facilities may be destroyed.

[2044. 40-2046. 88] We also consider small and medium ships. [2046. 88-2049. 60] may be in this reconstruction of the business opportunity. [2049. 60-2052. 36] is more likely to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. [2052. 36-2053. 96] Of course, it does not affect cap size. [2053. 96-2056. 04] For steel is required. [2056. 04-2057. 20] The production of steel is expected to increase.

[2057. 20-2057. 92] Steel production is expected to increase. [2058. 12-2060. 28] will be iron ore sand. [2060. 28-2062. 08] Iron ore sand will probably be used cap size. [2062. 08-2063. 64] Therefore, it is not related. [2063. 64-2065. 68] If you want to enter the black sea. [2065. 68-206. 16] Traditionally cap size and panamix.

[2068. 16-2070. 52] is not the most important type of ship. [2070. 52-2071. 12] Yes. [2071. 12-2074. 00] Because most of the port of the Black Sea is not. [2074. 00-2075. 76] The scale is so large. [2075. 76-2078. 40] So I think this is the only one without trinity. [2078. 40-2079. 76] A possible evolution.

[2079. 76-2081. 04] But it must be said again. [2081. 04-2082. 64] We also don't feel it. [2082. 64-2084. 52] Because there is no respect for the reconstruction of this load. [2084. 52-2085. 96] Reconstruction must be worth the money. [2085. 96-2087. 20] Where the money comes from. [2087. 20-2088. 32] To borrow from the family.

[2088. 322092. 24] How great is the reconstruction of Ukraine. [2092. 24-2094. 44] capacity [2094. 44-2097. 00] Is it possible to have such a good financial support? [2097. 00-2099. 44] We are actually not sure at the moment. [2099. 44-101. 04] So we will not say two or three respects. [210. 04-2102. 72] It is definitely a good thing to say. [2102102. 72-2106. 20] I think it is too early to say something.

[2106. 20-2108. 88] But the business opportunities are right. [2108. 88-2112. 20] This is probably our view of the undisputed. [2112. 20-2115. 48] But not the next. [2115. 48-2117. 04]

The mood will be upside down. Because cap size. His shipment of goods is relatively simple. So, his scenery is affected by this single shipment. It will be much more.

He is the one who has the most power, and the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power, the one who has the most power.

It's good to see it. But that's it. The tradition of operating cap size has to have this heart. To handle these up and down. Sometimes the amount of money lost on a day is not too early.

And most of us are not in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position as those who are in the same position.

Most of the time, when the time is right, when the time is right, when the time is right; when the time is right, when the time is right; when the time is right, when the time is right; when the time is right; when the time is right, when the time is right.

The tradition is low, but that's okay, it's a few weeks high, just like this 2021, the whole thing is very good.

This is the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, and the year of the Lord's return, and the year of the Lord's return.

It's not as good as 2024 because it's a low season. You don't see it going down. It's smooth, but it's not that bad after all.

Because we can only say that we have just shared with you the seasonality of the loose market. It is a good factor. But it is definitely not the case that the market is going to go like this. I believe that this is the same as the capital market. That is what we can share with investors in accordance with our experience. Market analysis is these seasonalities of the long-term market.

But when there are more important factors influencing the market, we. Our own prediction is also often inaccurate, but so far, this February is not good, and then go up.

This is the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan.

Then there's a chance to go up. But there's also a downside. So there's no way to guarantee it. Yes, we're going to copy this 2021 limit. This is still being developed too early.

Influencing trends. Take a look at the previous two slides. Then we'll share with you a little bit about this spread. Here are some of the data we've found in this industry for a long time.

We do not have any tags for You Are The One [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics.

It is a ship, and it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship; it is a ship.

But for the new ship that hasn't been created yet, it won't be true. It will be a little bit. This is uncertain, because our land data is the same.

There is no such thing as faith; there is no such thing as faith; there is no such thing as faith; there is no such thing as faith; there is no such thing as faith; there is no such thing as faith.

There are some differences. You can see it. This is the whole world. If we compare with this ship, it's the main ship.

The ship of CAPSYS is less than 20 years old. It is about 15% relative to HANDYSYS. That is, if we look at the new boat, it is also about 15%. This may be the next three years. The ship of more than 20 years will write it down.

I have three to five years of experience in this field, and it is difficult for me to say this because I have a relationship with the mine. When I try to mine, everyone will not be able to dismantle the ship. After the mine is poor, the hair will be dismantled.

So it's hard to say, but it's a question. This is an export of a question. This concept of the birth rate death rate, that HANDYSYS's word, this birth rate may be relatively high in the next few years.

So we felt that HANDYSYS was not very sexy. It was a big deal. It was good. But in fact, for a long time. We thought it was competitive. For the company to provide a stable cash flow.

That's right. That's why we have our new shipbuilder orders today. There are 11 of them all concentrated in Handysys. I think this is also a kind of response to such a market.

This is a great way for us to be able to see what God has planned for us, and to be able to see what He has planned for us, and to see what He has planned for us, and to see what He has planned for us, and to see what He has planned for us.

TAMSAT is a lot. The SUPRA has Handysys as well. So this is a little reflection of our current view of the market. A relationship with the shipyard.

Next, we'll spread the light. If we're going to share this new shipbuilder's order. This is the number 20 years ago. You can make a reference. In fact, the new shipbuilder's order has increased substantially over the years. So in the early years, we'd think that's a big gap.

So, like before 2021, it looks like HANDYSYS has a figure of 2.8. Now it's just too fast. But it's probably a healthy one. Overall, average.

Shipbuilding volume is compared to old ships. Predictably there is nothing quite clear. Which side is larger and smaller. That's why. There are some recent orders. May be as booked in 2023.

Probably 26 27 25. Land continued to ship, so the next few years.

In the past, we have seen the difference between the number of new ships and the number of old ships. In 2015, when we first saw that they were starting to build ships, but the number of old ships was not so much, so the atmosphere would be a bit unbalanced with the process, there will be a little over supply, then the old ones will continue to increase, then the old ones will continue to increase, and then it is in this short time, so in the past years there is often a lot of orders. So this part of this is very good with the situation in the epidemic container, this has a very good relationship, container when they have a lot of orders, so the data of the two big differences, then we found that the order of bulk ship has decreased, and then the bulk of orders are likely to be changed. In the last part of our industry, we have to talk about the part of the regulation, in fact, although we have a very traditional industry, we have thousands of years, from everyone to Oceania adventure, the Mediterranean of North Ningji is a ship industry, but in recent years, we have said that we ship safer, this ship also in China industry do not want to be environmentally friendly, especially now the rise of environmental protection, the ship is very polluted source of pollutants, this is we think that if we say that we are very polluted, this is a wish, because we are actually paying a lot of goods, so if we are carrying the pollutant goods, it is not high, but indeed the ship is a lot of environmental protection space, so we have to reduce from light oxide emissions, pressure water treatment system is to reduce, I do not talk, because if you are interested, you can participate in the previous years of the rule of these things.

We don't know whether or not President Trump's role in Paris will affect us. But, in fact, Trump's performance in the United Nations, we drive emissions measurement reductions, which has been happening. And, in fact, the EU has not stopped his pace in this regard. In fact, I personally feel that the EU is a little bit, and that they themselves are not prepared, and I will think so.

The first part of the CO2 emissions is the energy efficiency index for Trump's design. That is, the design of the ship is what you do. If it is too high, like some old ships, the index of energy consumption is not good and the efficiency is not good. His EEDI will be over-rated and then he will slow down or add something else. Now most of it is slowing down. Before the EEXI comes out, then everyone says, wow, the ship is slowing down.

In fact, the first thing to say is that many ships are not running at full speed at full speed. I'm now saying full speed is 85%. 85% treatment is not 100%. 100% no one runs for long periods of time. 85% is actually a normal full speed. But in fact, many can only run at 60 percent, 70%, energy saving oil.

So this EEXI later felt the impact on the market, in fact, it was limited. It was just that the limited boat was no longer running. He had to run at a relatively low speed, so it really had an impact on the ship's capacity.

This is part of our impact on EEXI. Because our ships are relatively new, we are affected by EEDI in 125 ships. It is actually twice as fast as 10%. This is a relatively old ship, part of this entrance area. The other is Cover Intensity Indicator, which is a calculation of CII.

These are some indexes. That is, you have so many shields in the past year. Load so many shields of goods to run these places. Then you emit so much carbon. It helps you calculate if you don't meet the standards. Then it helps you score ABCDE.

But this is a little bit of the current state of being closer to the tiger, because it is not known by its laws, and then it must be done well. It is a little different from this EEXI. Because EEXI at least says that you have not reached the end, you have to slow down.

But we can see it from these things. Because the international environment is an upgrade to the environmental requirements of ships. Then from different directions, from the design of the ship, from your actual emissions. Then, let's just say from your journey. Different ways to calculate your carbon emissions. So we now report a lot more requirements.

It's like that. So, now it's about the European Union, just the United Nations class. Now it's the European Union. The EU is at the forefront of this. The first thing it does is carbon tax.

You want to buy a carbon right and give it to the EU. Then, it may be that if you run in the EU, you have to give 100%. If you go from outside the EU to the EU, give 50%. It is about that. Then, it has an approximate upgrade.

That's about it. How big is this impact on us? We'll probably look at it. If we use 500% per ton of fuel, that's probably 500% per ton of fuel. If we use 500% per ton of fuel, that's probably 500% per ton of fuel.

If we use 580 per ton of fuel, it is probably 580 per ton of fuel. If we use 580 per ton of fuel, it's probably about 580 to 727. It's the same as 2025. So the fuel cost is increased by 25%. This is a relatively practical effect of the EU carbon tax.

But let's take a look at this, which is a 5% plus. How does that 25% affect the membership? Very small. Because our fuel is paid by the renter. We just talked about this electrode output. The renter is responsible for specifying where the ship will go from where to.

So fuel is their responsibility. Beyond that fuel, if you want me to go to the European Union to generate carbon tax, it is also the renter's responsibility. So it is a small impact on us. But there is a certain degree of impact on marketability on the ship. The more energy efficient you ship, the renter will say, 'Oh, I saved a lot because I could only save 580 tonnes and now I can save 727.

Of course, the price of the EU is always changing, so this is just a reference for everyone at the current market price. So we think that these EU regulations will be kidnapped slowly. Then for ships with better energy efficiency, it is a business advantage. The new Fuel-EU Maritime is not the same, it is not just for your carbon emissions to collect water, we want to encourage you to use a different fuel, with low carbon emissions. So you can use what electricity, or real-value fuel, a bunch can do.

However, the condition is that it will catch you first that the ship does not comply with the energy of the GHG, Greenhouse Gas Integrity, there is no more than this. This kind of interest, self-study, we are not the chemistry, so we can't talk too much. There is no demand for this energy more than this intensity. If the carbon emissions are too much, you will be fined.

However, this Fuel-EU is a little less than just carbon emissions, and you pay carbon tax regardless of whether it is 3,7,20,10. But this is a punishment to encourage it. So you can use some other method, for example, you can buy some reproductive fuel to add.

So, you can hand over this 11% fine instead of getting 5% to buy these reproductive fuels, and so on. That is to encourage these Oternative Fuels, or alternative fuels, a little strange. It is the development of new fuels and new energy.

And then, that's it, so now there's a few morepoolings in addition to these fuels. As some companies say, well, now we're going to make a pool. You, your company's ship joins us, their ship joins us. We're responsible for arranging some of these fuels so that our people's energy consumption is in line with the regulations. But you're going to pay.

So we found out that such environmental requirements, in fact, are the birth of some professional assistance providers, are specialized in dealing with, how to save you carbon tax, how to help you save this fine, such an industry. So we feel that the impact on the environment as a whole, it is there.

However, we do have an overall impact on our revenues, but it is limited. Our strategy for the future is to continue to strengthen our financial structure. As you can see, we actually have a good picture of our operations over the years, and we don't have a lot of CAPEX, so we have to pay back the money, so we have more impact now. But we still need to be careful about the risk of exchange rates and interest rates, because the US dollar rate is of course higher.

I'm now 24 minutes away, so at this point, I don't know what the problem is, we can use this opportunity to exchange. There's more than one boat that pushes China's collection of ships to help cope with the environment. Thanks for your question, it's also a lot of people talking about, and we're also in the industry. To be honest, I think the difficulty of this implementation is still high, and the impact is not small. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

It is not China, I just know what it is. So China is not necessarily China, because what Panama rides, the German planes in Barra have, the Chinese set is not so much. But China's ship, in fact, probably from the construction of pirates, probably the world's ship first, so he made a lot of ships. Of course, President Trump is talking a lot, so it's a big goal, a leader in the big direction.

But this is something that, if it really can be implemented in the operation of the ship, I want to first say why we feel it is difficult to implement, because we think it is a bit difficult. But I think this is not the problem we should be worried about, this is what President Trump's ruling team is going to worry about. But it is not difficult to do, because every ship is really clear, and he reports that I have to rely on the port, and all your information is clear. So to do this, he is technically difficult, you can't say that you're a Chinese-made, you'll have to be more expensive, and I think he's a more difficult one.

If the ship is not willing to rent you this ship, you do not need to pay a lot of extra fees, so our judgment is that if this is the case, for the non-China ship is beneficial, that is very unlikely, our company ships are all made in Japan, which is our strategy for a long time, we are mostly made in Japan, some of China are made in Japan, it will not be taxed, and it is still taxed, because we met, but most of the ships we made in Japan, so we think this thing, I heard, I first thought, wow, there is this thing, I am surprise, there is no such thing, but there is a little surprise for us, but if this thing happens, I think it can last long, because this is the surcharge, at any time, he will add, stop, so I think, it is going to the market, but I don't know how the economic impact of the President Trump's to see this, but it is still a problem that we still see it is still a two days. If you are looking for a ship that is not the best for you, you will be able to buy a ship. If you are looking for a ship that is not the best for you, you will be able to buy a ship that is the best for you. If you are looking for a ship that is the best for you, you will be able to buy a ship that is the best for you. If you are looking for a ship that is the best for you, you will be able to buy a ship that is the best for you. If you are looking for a ship that is the best for you, you will be able to buy a ship that is the best for you. If you are looking for a ship that is the best for you, then it will be the best for you.

This is not the case for the 2025 market. I think it will continue to be that bad, because like I just said, I think this is the first quarter of this year, especially in February, and this is the situation that lasts last year. After President Trump's appointment, we expect to say we should be more of the Certainty, as if it were not, because he did not say much of the situation like this one. I said, he extended a month, he did not say cancel or say anything like this, but this is not the case, but it is a bit of the case.

It is not a problem, as we just said, we actually want to start again, there is a car, shelter environment, things to ask Schnter, become л, now is a number of abbreviation, China focus, at the same time GU modeling, Discord, there are a lot of container default to convert orders, but with the current financial condition of container, I think it should not be, and in fact, his market is also a bit of up and down, not say go down, so we think, and then if there is just said that, container Balker, it should not be so, so we for the next two years, supply stability is considered stable. Thank you for all of you investors involved in today, and thank you for the brief discussion of Huiyang company, today, and thank you for the conclusion.
