<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided copying fragments, sorting them into paragraph copying. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the copywriting structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, for example, [497. 42-500. 50] We can see that this was in the first quarter of 2025.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this is a talk about the company's first quarter 2025 financial statements, including gross profit margin, revenue growth, departmental performance, and future plans. Speakers may turn to discuss the impact of tariff policies and response strategies after introducing financial data. Next, I need to determine how to segment.

For example, sentences about gross profit and business profit rates can be combined into paragraphs, where revenue growth in various departments can be taken as another segment, and the impact of tariff policies as another part. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same logical unit, for example, "the total revenue has reached 62%" in the first quarter of the year and "the first quarter of the 21 year" should be linked together to form a contrast. At the same time, timestamps may help determine the order of the sentence, but the user requests do not follow the timestamp, but the content is arranged logically, so it is necessary to judge according to the context.

We can see that our gross profit margin increased to 22.6% in the first quarter of 2025, which increased to 10.1% in the first quarter. As part of our business model optimisation, we are developing a high-value business for this system integration, including our optoelectronic and cloud division. In the first quarter, the overall revenue has reached 62%, compared to the first quarter of 21, so the growth of the high-value business has led to an increase in the overall profit margin.

In the first quarter, our revenue of $6.4 billion increased by 27%, and our three major business segments grew year-on-year. Gross profit margin of 22.6%, profit margin of 10.1%, both of which increased by 2.3 percentage points each year, mainly due to the increase in the proportion of high-value business, the optimization of global operational efficiency, coupled with close cooperation with the supply chain. R&D accounted for 5.6% of the revenue of the current quarter, the amount of revenue was nearly 20%, focusing on cloud-based 5G and new business.

In April, the Board of Directors decided to buy back 130,000 stocks, from April 10th to June 9th, which has already bought back 12135 shares as of April 29th, which mainly reflects our core values and the intention of safeguarding shareholders' rights and interests. At the same time, we are planning to hold a shareholders' meeting on 520 and May 20th. This is my very first financial focus report, and the next time I will pass to the general manager Anson to explain the company's outlook and long-term growth strategy. Thank you, Jerry, and thank you for all the investment partners and media friends who came here today.

I know there may be a lot of legal conflicts today, so today we can see you sitting in this place, our PR department has a special thank you to you all. So I think we may all feel that the venue is different today, why we just said that we have been in this international conference room in our company all the way to do this kind of real-world law. Today, because just like our whole body of this international conference center in remodel, there is a more comfortable and comfortable environment for you to come back to our international conference room in the future.

I think that's the same thing that we all look forward to in the second quarter of the world's economic situation. I think one of the most important things in the second quarter should be the impact of this tariff policy in the United States. So I think I'm going to start talking with you first, and why I'm talking to a few important customers, and some of our peers, including some of our best friends in this industry, have done some communication and understanding.

In fact, this may be the first to decide what the tariff policy would be like for a final landing bid. Based on what I think we can do is if we can do as much as we can in our own internals as possible to do, and the external things that can't change, I think there is no way to see how the external changes that we should react. As for how we respond to this, I think I can share with you the things that this tariff policy is, and I don't want to do for a particular country, so we all face the same environment. So we should go back to our own internals to think about how we find a good position in this transition.

In this way, we can change things in a way that we can change. Then, in this process, we can create our company.

Investors. There is a better one. Turn around. So I think the first we might have to strengthen us. This is made all over the world. Layout.

That's what I think. Under the inevitable premise of tariffs, we should go ahead and build a more. A resilient one. supply chain This supply chain. In addition to ourselves.

We are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God, we are the people of God.

It's more complete than that, it's a regional supply chain, and I think it's the first very important thing, that's the second.

Of course, in the end, tariffs affect costs, so how to reduce our costs, that's probably also from our own.

So how to improve ourselves, this product, this so-called, technology, or the value of the product itself.

This is what we've been doing all along. Over the years, our company has been working on so-called, system, so-called solutions.

That's what I think. If today we can take our company's products to the next level of value. I believe. In today's layout. We should compare.

The third I think we can also from here. We ourselves in addition to our own product. How we are apart from our products.

We are the ones who have the power to do this, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, the ones who have the power to do it, and the ones who have the power to do it.

I think that's a very important thing, because we have to be honest.

This is the whole production. Costs are put in the same place when. The cost of management is minimal. But today, if we have to move elsewhere in response to tariff policies, in fact, what we worry about is our supply chain.

They are not as powerful as we are, but as powerful as we are, and they are not as powerful as we are, but as we are created to be.

"I think it's very important to have one thing in mind. That's how we help our suppliers, how we bind them more closely, how we can help them, how we can help them, and how we can help them create a local supply chain.

This is the way of the righteous, the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked.

All of us have been taught to do good, and to do good, and to do evil, and to do evil, and to do good.

The cost increases, the end, I think, yes, from the customer's point of view, so of course.

We will work with our customers to improve the competitiveness of our customers. From this, the upstream and downstream of the market. Inside the supply chain, we all optimize our costs. From this point of view.

"Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, and that I am the Lord your God.

If you have any further questions to ask yourself, let's take a closer look at the details. That's what I'd like to explore today. I'd also like to take this opportunity to report to everyone in this occasion because we're in season 1. There's a chance to participate in this NWC and GTC.

So I'd like to make a short video today. Come and share it with us. We've got some of the highlights in these two shows.

Let's take a look at the video. Then we see it again. Chinese subtitles provided. Chinese subtitles provided. Chinese subtitles provided. Chinese subtitles provided.

English word.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for two days ye shall not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, neither shall ye drink of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

I have a chance to explain the situation in Vietnam. In fact, the green part of Vietnam is the two green parts. After the first quarter we can clearly feel the whole green rise. It has been a lot of progress.

But we're in Vietnam. It's really the most important thing. Our current focus is still on our online products. That first quarter started. We also moved our automated products to Vietnam.

So I would like to automate the product is our second one. It was just this Shift you mentioned. This is a relatively high price right now. And this part is relatively complex compared to the production. Now the positive is all in our Kaohsiung expansion. As far as possible, avoid the impact of the Vietnam factory.

So I think the good news is that Vietnam is just as good as the internet. In automatic communication as well. The overall yield of the collective has been down as well as two quarters this quarter. I see a good improvement.

I would like to say that if this feeling is present in the market, I would like to say that if this feeling is present in the market, I would like to say that if this feeling is present in the market. If this feeling is present in the market, I would say that if this feeling is present in the market, I would say that if this feeling is present in the market, I would say that if this feeling is present in the market. If this feeling is present in the market, I would like to say that if this feeling is present in the market.

I think we're talking about the third quarter. I think we're talking about the third quarter. I think we're talking about the third quarter as well. This should be part of this. The products that should be computed move to Vietnam. To avoid this, the process of moving is too complicated.

Then, the effect of these yields. This is for the whole. One of the best configurations to consider. I would like to ask you a question about tariffs. That is, if you are part of a customer's global hub warehouse.

After that, the customer pulls himself to the ODM, such as Mexico, to assemble himself. These components are not recognized. In the customer's inventory. Further, it can be avoided. This is the risk of tariffs. If from our point of view.

The system is counted as a part. It is connected to the system. So we are not directly facing this tariff. But we are like some of our optoelectronics. The product is some direct.

This is the part of the U.S. market. In fact, we may use some. The price adjustment to do this. The tax part is listed. But this makes up the whole of our photovoltaic.

The proportion is less than two percent. My two percent is. Revenue is less than two percent is. Out of the United States. The others are like some might apply to customers. There is also part of accessibility.

That's how we got out of the US. That's because the current portion is so small. So the current portion of the tariff is very small, so we're all customers now.

It's like this. Stan Rex. The manager is good. I'm a wild spring. So I'd like to ask, because the recent exchange rate of Taiwan dollars.

It is very fast. We are on top of this exchange rate. How is the currency risk handled? I think.

"This is the first time in the year that we have seen it," he said, "and this is the first time we have seen it, and we have seen it.

So whether it is against the dollar, whether it is against the yuan. Although we do not take a few. But some short-term hedges should be done. So we have to do it.

There are a few plans to expand in the United States. We can't help it.

We will expand what we do in the United States. About how much money we spend. Such arrangements. Well, I think it was originally a U.S. expansion plan. Until this impact on tariff policies.

We have seen this before, and we have seen it in the past, and we have seen it in the past, and we have seen it in the past, and we have seen it in the future.

One is ready to do this power shelf. Two production lines to do so. Then it was because of this. Just this good friend asked. That is because of the relationship between BPU this product. So we are now on Planet.

We continue to expand the line of two BPUs. That currently looks like the line of two BPUs. Maybe not enough. So we are also continuously evaluating. The possibility of the fourth and fifth lines. Of course the most important.

Just what you mentioned. That's the whole investment.

I think the most important information is to let people know that the company actually has a plan in the future Plan O, that is, there may be our own production base, which is our own investment, that is, we can update, that is, we also have a double BBU in Kaohsiung, and then the United States has two lines, that is, it is in the third quarter of the third quarter, the BBU part.

The next generation of AI Server, because now the mainstream to 5500 watts, then the next generation of AI Server, feel is a lot of divergent views, some say 67 kW, some say 78,000, and some say 10,000, that is, I do not know what the general manager looks like, or I put the mainstream to 5,000 watts, this next generation of words, now is doing, of course, the eight kW of kW of kW, but the existing mainstream, maybe customers will decide whether to temporarily or not this mainstream, has been put on a 5,000 watt of such a level. Because they also found that in 8000 kW of watts, it may be relatively expensive compared to the cost, this is possible.

So no matter what a customer is, the two customers are the same for us, OK thanks. There is also a question about the tariff section. General manager Hello, a few questions first ask the first relatively simple, you just mentioned that the tariff is also seen, only the light point, there is a little product hair. So the frequency of requencies Manatee pick-up ball rotation is less than 2% only want to confirm that it is 2% of the photoelectric sector or 2% of the total revenue of the photoelectric sector. So the ratio is very low, so this part of the tariff is that we have to cover this part of us. So the impact of this part, of course, we can decide our price, so we decided to do some adjustments on the price, so let the amount of the tax to be paid is a little bit like this.

So that's the only part we have to pay directly, this is the most direct, OK OK. Then the second word is that I just talked about more BBU, can I first ask, how can I give our BBU's revenue share in the first quarter? Because its classification should be in the cloud computing power supply is not right, and that way we can give this proportion. The first is that if I say that I use Cloud Computing as 100%, then BBU, it has more than 10% of the revenue in the first quarter, OK.

So you just mentioned a second season, because you'll say that QOQ will continue to feel like it's being shipped in the second season. So it's possible that it's growing YY or a very high percentage of YY, yes, that's how OK will see it in the second half of the year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like it is a report on the business situation of the company, involving factors such as areas of AI, capacity planning, revenue ratio, tax rate changes, and improved profit margins. Next, I need to reorganize the sentences that were originally cut into sequences, while maintaining the original order and content of each sentence. During the process, I need to pay attention to the mapping of timestamps to ensure that each sentence is in the correct position. For example, the first sentence is [2549.-04-2551. 04] is difficult, and then the second half of [2551. 04-2552. 60] is determined, and so on. I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and semantic nature to avoid mechanical build-types.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete in the syntax, or need to be connected to make the paragraph smoother, but according to the user's request, no rewriting can be made, so only the original arrangement can be arranged. During the processing process, there may be some situations in which it is necessary to determine how to segment. For example, when a person is asked, the other person should be separated by a line or a space. However, according to the example provided by the user, it seems that the same person needs to merge the continuous speech into the paragraph and the speech between different people is separated.

In addition, pay attention to the correct representation of numbers and percentages, such as "560 percent", "seven to eight percent", etc., to ensure that these data are clearly readable in paragraphs. At the same time, timestamps may not need to be displayed in the final paragraph verb, but the example provided by the user retains the timestamp, so it is necessary to confirm whether the content needs to be retained. According to the example provided by the user, it seems that timestamps are omitted, so it may be necessary to remove the timestamp and only retain the content. Finally, check if there are missing sentences or sequence errors, make sure that everything is arranged correctly, and no content is added or deleted.

[Scripture Fragments]:. [2549. 04-2551. 04] is currently very difficult, although it is currently difficult. [2551. 04-2552. 60] The second half of the year has been determined. [2552. 60-2554. 68] I just followed you to report it. [2554. 68-2557. 60] It is now in the field of AI. [2557. 60-2559. 10] We have been with our customers.

[2559. 10-2561. 32] Visibility is probably no problem this year. [2561. 32-2563. 52] and it is already closed to customers. [2563. 52-2564. 44] We are also worried. [2564. 44-2567. 14] Because just so many good friends are asking. [2567. 14-2568. 40] These production capacity is out. [2568. 40-2570. 92] We are also worried about the capacity is not going to come out.

[2570. 92-2572. 92] So I think we'll be very careful. [2572. 92-2573. 92] That's why we're so cautious. [2573. 92-2575. 92] We'll check with our customers. [2575. 92-2577. 92] This requirement is not real. [2577. 92-2580. 42] All of you know this fact. [2580. 42-2583. 26] Cloud needs these CSPs.

[2583. 26-2586. 52] These big guests have their own internal planning and needs. [2586 52-2590. 90] It is not affected by market factors. [2590. 90-2592. 80] Everyone should be able to understand it. [2592. 80-2594. 44] So they will follow them. [2594. 44-2595. 84] Plan to do it. [2595. 84-2597. 38] If they are planning to do it.

[2597. 38-2599. 88] That is 100% real. [2599. 88-2601. 98] does not say that the business is not good now. [2601 98-2605. 52] So this business immediately drop. [2605. 52-2607. 72] Similar to consumer may have more. [2607. 72-2609. 78] This commercial features. [2609. 78-2611. 26] But in CSP.

[2611. 26-2613. 40] They put so much cabbage down. [2613. 40-2616. 62] is prepared to cover how much this data center. [2616. 62-2618. 90] These are all their established plans. [2618. 90-2620. 94. 94. 261. 76] I think this part. [2621. 76-2623. 70] They gave us a lot of confidence to say.

[2623. 70-2624. 06] [2624. 44-2625. 64] We will follow their own way. [2625. 64-2627. 04] Today the band within budget. [2627. 04-2629. 14] The cabbage that is always put in. [2629. 14-2630. 44] How much data center will be covered. [2630. 44-2631. 72] How much will it cost.

[2631. 72-2632. 72] This is very certain. [2632. 72-2634. 12] So we can not hesitate. [2634. 12-2636. 82] And because we opened our capacity after. [2636. 82-2639. 28] In fact, we have a final guarantee. [2639. 28-2641. 26] Because we know that our capacity is in one place. [2641. 26-2643. 60] To some extent he also has some commitment to us.

[2643. 60-2646. 60] How to give us this capacity to fullfill. [2646. 60-2649. 06] This is what I think is right. [2649. 06-2650. 66] For this industry. [2650. 66-2653. 34] We think it is a place of more confidence. [2653. 34-2654. 44] That is, if a right is used. [2654. 44-2656. 74] Because it has just been pushed to yoy in the first half of the year.

[2656. 74-2659. 08] is actually higher than fifty sixty percent of the yoy. [2659. 08-2661. 14] That will give one year. [2667. 14-2664. 12] Is the yoy growth idea of roughly. [2667. 38-2669. 12] This yoy is the yoy of the company. [2669. 12-2672. 56] That would be if it was just doing this part of the cloud. [2672. 56-2675. 02] In fact, the whole year should be more than 50%.

[2675. 02-2676. 32] There is no big problem. [2676. 32-2676. 56] [2677. 96-2679. 40] The last small problem is that [2679. 40-2683. 54] Before that, all AI-related revenue ratios were provided. [2683. 54-2684. 30] It was like last year. [2684. 30-2685. 74] Could be seven to eight percent.

[2685. 74-2690. 10] Before that there was also a mention that this year might seem like fourteen to fifteen percent. [2690. 10-2691. 34] So now it is still maintained. [2691. 34-2693. 00] Now it may be a little higher than this number. [2693. 00-2695. 82] That's because the total denominator is lower or the reason. [2695. 82-2700. 64] I think that our previous company would probably be growing this year. [2700. 64-2702. 52] So the denominator will not be smaller.

[2702. 52-274. 82] That growth part. [2704. 82-2707. 72] is mainly from the cloud part. [2707. 72-2710. 96] The main thing is not to say that all the main thing will be here. [2710. 96-2731. 66] Because this proportion is raised later. [2713. 66-2714. 30] Of course, [2714. 30-2716. 10] This branch is also larger.

[2716. 10-2719. 48] His ratio will slightly decrease. [2719. 48-2723. 08] If you look at today from this industry in the cloud. [2723. 08-2724. 98] His ratio may be very high. [2724. 98-2726. 92] But because these divisions go. [2726. 92-2729. 68] The whole branch of this fraction will go down slightly. [2729. 68-2732. 06] His ratio will go down slightly.

[2732. 06-2733. 92] That's why this happened. [2733. 92-2736. 62] So it should now look like it could be more than 15 percent. [2736. 62-2737. 62] The last small number. [2737. 62-274. 82] If this part of this year's yoy is fifty percent. [2740. 82-2743.4. 66] How many BBUs will occupy here in the end of the year?

[2744. 30-2745. 84] The first quarter is greater than 10 percent. [2745. 84-2749. 14] How much do you think it might be for the whole year? [2749. 14-2752. 44] If so, all year round. [2752. 44-2755. 08] Light BBU personal estimate. [2755. 08-2758. 74] It should be a chance to make up about 70%.

[2758. 74-2761. 08] Seven percent to eight percent. [2761. 08-2766. 06] This refers to seven to eight percent of the company's revenue. [2766. 06-2768. 20] All the company's revenue is seven to eight. [2768. 20-2769. 66] Ok Thank you. [2774. 30-2784. 10] Thank you. [2798. 06-2798. 90] Then I was KGI.

[2798. 90-2800. 60] The one I would like to ask more briefly. [2800. 60-2803. 10] This year's tax rate is probably changed. [2803. 10-2803. 72] Thank you. [2804. 30-2810. 08] I think everyone can see the first quarter of the presentation. [2810. 08-2814. 58] The tax rate is probably due to a relationship with the lowest tax burden.

[2814. 58-2817. 96] There is a slight increase to 26%. [2817. 96-2823. 40] But with a plan of one tax burden across the globe. [2823. 40-2827. 34] In fact, it will grow slightly in the quarter this year. [2827. 34-2832. 04] But it will not be as high as the first quarter. [2834. 30-2838. 76] The color will appear to be slightly lower than last year. [2838. 76-2840. 46] A slight increase.

[2864. 30-2879. 36] We opened up a problem again. [2886. 14-2890. 02] Julia is sorry that I have two problems. [2888. 02-2892. 70] The first thing I want to ask is the company here. [2892. 70-2894. 14] That's because your first quarter profit margin is really good. [2897. 60-2897. 60] That's especially in the by sector.

[2901 08-2902. 60] Cloud and Opto. [2902. 60-2904. 64] year over year is really good. [2904. 64-2908. 22] Other than the improvement of the Product Mix. [2908. 22-2910. 96] There are no other factors. [2910. 96-2913. 46] It can be because of our first quarter. [2913. 46-2915. 10] is very good.

[2915. 10-2917. 32] On the material exchange rate. [2917. 32-2919. 82] Or there are no fees. [2919. 82-2922. 46] Or there are no other legends. [2922. 46-2924. 26] Are there any other improvements besides Product Mix. [2924. 30-2927. 30]? [2927. 30-2929. 30] If you go to Quantify.

[2929. 30-2930. 86] That is to say, this Product Mix. [2930. 86-2932. 30] For improvement in profit margins. [2932. 30-2935. 34] It is likely to catch several bibs. [2935. 34-2936. 54] This year over year. [2936. 54-2938. 22] quarter over quarter quarter quarter quarter. [2938. 22-2942. 88] Thank you for your question.

[2942. 88-2947. 16] That was the first product I really wanted to start with. [2947. 16-2950. 4

The same is true in the first quarter, and it has returned to a positive momentum. So it has also driven the profitability of the information sector. Business benefits have also increased significantly. That is, of course, this increase is slightly lower than our IT department. In fact, the information sector has a few important transformations over the years.

The second is that although it is a high-end product, the second is that although it is a high-end product, the second is that although it is a high-end product, the second is that although it is a high-end product, the second is that although it is a high-end product, the second is that although it is a high-end product, it is a high-end product.

For example, these LEOs, low-latitude satellites, and this power supply, like industrial power, more, more diversified to develop. That's also driving these relative margins, there are some areas where there's improvement. In fact, there's another thing to mention, because we're manufacturing, so driving rates are really important for this GP. As we've mentioned in the first quarter of the year, we've grown by 27%. So this also shows that we can benefit from this operatingscale, our revenue, our shipping increase, and the entire margin structure, which will be improved.

I've always said that the nature of the company's operations is changing. The most important thing is that what we do is what we do in the past and what we do in the present. Maybe you just have a question, you will evaluate how we do drive, our cost down, to find ways to make these costs more optimized. But in fact, our costs are what we do in value up, even if we are all doing the same thing, we don't focus on the same things we do in these three departments, and then we're going to grab orders.

So this is the first major reason, the second, from the point of view of portfolio, we used to talk with you in the past, is called 433, that is, automation, automation is an important thing. Now in fact, our department may account for 40%, photoelectric and cloud 60%, then in fact, our communication product if in the first quarter, it already accounts for 38 percent, then we with this cloud department, has been upgraded to 62 percent, in fact, has reached this part of what we originally set out. The third part is in my head, in addition to just saying that because the amount of this order came in, resulting in the increase in capacity utilization, the past two years in Vietnam, is a relatively large setback, so in the fourth quarter to the first quarter of this year, the second quarter, we have slowly brought it back to what should be, so let us make this percentage, only in the first quarter of last year, this year, about the same quarter, about the first quarter, it is nearly 9 percent. This is the second question I want to ask, because in fact, the first quarter of this gross profit margin has been high season, in the past few years, the first quarter of the company, in fact, the profit margin is probably a relatively low position, but the first quarter of the year has been such a low position, but how do we think back, is good or high-end product look, especially in the AI part of the first quarter has no decline, then there are already high season of the past season, then after the third quarter of the peak season, will be more intense than the previous season, or with the current quarter of the figure may be almost the impact, this is a relatively large variable, if we don't think about this variable, then the first quarter of the second quarter will be better than the first quarter, the third quarter will be the highest, the fourth quarter will be the next quarter will go down.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to arrange these sentences in logical order, while keeping the order and content of the original sentence.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic and should be merged into the same paragraph, while sentences of different topics need to be separated. First, I will check each entry in a row to see which sentences can be merged. For example, starting from [3369. 48-3375. 48], the user mentions the last question and then explains the definition of the BBU amount, which may need to be merged into a paragraph.

At the same time, pay attention to whether the connection between sentences is natural, whether it needs to add a link or adjust the punctuation mark, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so it is only possible to adjust the structure by changing the line and paragraph separator. In addition, the user refers to "not delete any sentence", so it is necessary to ensure that all sentences are included without missing. For example, there are multiple sentences in the last part of the thank you, and it is necessary to check each one to check whether they are placed correctly. Finally, I will read the entire conversion of the paragraph typed verbs, confirming that there is no violation of the user's requirements, and that all content is accurately preserved, and the paragraphs are divided and easy to read.

The last question is, the amount of BBU that we define is because we usually ship, and the BBU and the PSU will be together with a cabinet, which may not be a supporting one, so we don't. So this is simply the part of the BBU that does not include the matching PSU. As we just said is that the BBU can account for 7-8% of sales this amount all year round, it does not include the PSU that supports the BBU and the BBU package. There is no matching, it is the BBU and the PSU together, it is the matching. Yes, but not with the customer's system, it is our expenditure.

OK Thank you very much. Thank you all for your interest. We are going to this section of the legal community today. All the information will be posted on our website, and thank you all for your interest. Thank you all for your interest.
