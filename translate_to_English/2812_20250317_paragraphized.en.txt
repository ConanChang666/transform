<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and content. My task is to group these contents logically to form a natural paragraph. For example, parts such as "Other Guaranteed Loan Balance", "Storage Ratio", "Storage Spreads", and so on may require their own sections as they discuss different financial indicators. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic. For example, data and comparisons of the 2024 TWD deposit ratio should be put together, followed by the foreign currency deposit ratio and the total deposit ratio.

In handling the Net Interest Yield section, it is noted that there are several sentences that involve data from different years and quarters that need to be arranged in chronological order and to ensure that each data point corresponds correctly. For example, comparisons to 2023 and comparisons to the previous quarter should be explained in sub-paragraphs. In addition, regarding the parts of the Net Income Ratio and Asset Quality, the relevant data should be arranged logically, which may include the reasons for the change of total operating expenses, net income, and cost-effectiveness. Similarly, the Capital Adequacy section involves multiple ratios, such as capital adequacy, class 1, etc., which need to be segmented and compared by year.

At the same time, to check whether there are duplicated or formatted wrong sentences, such as missing or duplicated timestamps, to ensure that all data is accurate. Throughout the process, I need to maintain a high degree of attention, make sure that no word is missing, and arrange the correct order so that there is a logical connection between paragraphs. At the same time, to avoid any rewriting or condensation, strictly follow the user's requirements. After the initial draft, I will read the check again to confirm that all data points are correctly classified, paragraphs are reasonable, no omissions or errors.

I would like to answer a few questions. The first question is, how do you feel about this year's housing market and whether it will continue to grow this year's mortgage lending business, or whether it will have a loan strategy. We take a look at the government's policy face and a few market figures.

In addition, we have also observed that the number of domestic mortgages in the country last year was 4.57 million, a decrease of about 25% from the third quarter last year. We also observed that the shopping market has entered a cooling-off period this year, the number of transactions and the price space in the housing market has been loosened, and the market trend is gradually pushed to the buyer's market.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am the Financial Management Department and I would like to answer your questions on why I am looking forward to this part. As the international investment market is more volatile in the first quarter, we are expected to rebound upwards in the second quarter. The Bank will develop diversified financial products according to the market trend, according to the efficiency of the investment market is called the mother fund, and the fixed income products and customized goods to plan with customers, so that customers' assets allocation to achieve our business goals 100%.

In order to provide our high-asset customers with more complete financial products and services planning, we are currently applying for a 2.0 license, and are also launching a complete financial products and services. In addition to the continued launch of our innovative financial products, we are looking forward to improving the high-end asset management and enterprise intergenerational wealth transmitter solutions, so we are currently planning for 2.0, so thank you.

This is the first time that we have seen the interest rate on our bank, and the interest rate on some of our investments has been shown to be a smooth one, and we all have a bit of a flash. That is to say, if this year the central bank does not expect a rate hike or a downward rate, there is probably a deposit spread of yuan in another way. The only comparison to the current rate of interest is a downward rate, but the current rate of downward rate is currently a relatively uncertain situation. But just to mention that we have said that the return value of the foreign currency as a whole is not very high, so the outlook for NIN in the future is likely to remain the same in the third quarter of the fourth quarter.

In this context, we will still look at a central bank's outlook for this year, mainly to say that Trump's one policy uncertainty is not good for growth and inflation in the global economy. According to S&P Global, this year's economic growth rate is likely to be predicted in the global part at 2.6, which is already lower than that predicted in September. In the case of inflation, the same part of the February forecast is about 3. 45%, which is probably lower than the September forecast. The other part of the uncertainty will also affect the confidence of an investment, which leads to a relatively large part of a change in the market of financial markets, which is probably an international situation.

The inflation is likely to remain, but we all know it is probably because of it.

[2142. 54-2146. 18] The current scheduled progress is 89.55%. [2146. 18-2148. 80] The actual progress is 85. 28%. [2148. 80-2153. 04] There is a slight difference in progress behind the curve is 4. 37%. [2153. 04-2156. 26] The main main project will be behind the curve.

[2156. 26-2158. 74] Because we have completed a plan design for interior decoration last year. [2158. 74-2161. 42] and the completion of the plan design was completed on November 11 last year. [2161. 42-2165. 76] A plan design for interior decoration was completed. [2165. 76-2170. 84] The vendor filed a contract for construction work on November 30 last year. [2170. 84-2175. 38] All of the interior design works began on December 1st. [2175. 38-2179. 80] That is where we are now in the new headquarters building.

[2179. 80-2183. 26] At the same time, there are the main decoration package and the interior decoration package two parallel packages are carried out. [2183. 26-2185. 18] Two parallel packages are carried out. [2185. 18-2189. 90] So the initial coordination of the engineering interface is still underway. [2190. 70-2195. 26] This leads to a slight lag in the progress of our works. [2195. 26-2195. 74] This part of our current work is slightly behind. [2195. 74-2199. 98] We have continued to conduct the control and mediation of the project through the weekly engineering public meeting.

[2199. 98-2203. 92] Control and mediation of the works will be carried out in the official meeting. [2203. 92-2208. 04] We hope that in the near future this progress will be dedicated to it. [2208. 04-2210. 42] Another part of the interior decoration. [2210. 42-2213. 24] Our current scheduled progress is 2. 67%. [2213. 24-2215. 60] The actual progress is 2. 36%. [2215. 60-2218. 72] Also a slight lag of 0. 30%.

[2218. 72-2222. 12] This part is mainly the same as I said. [2222. 12-2225. 48] There are currently two parallel packages on the site for the integration of the engineering interface. [2225. 74-2228. 56] The integration of the engineering interface. [2228. 56-2234. 14] A plan for the coordination of the coordination and integration of the entire project with the two construction units has to be further integrated and perfected. [2234. 14-2238. 96] A plan for the follow-up line has to be further integrated and perfected. [2238. 96-2244. 68] We will continue to control the project through the weekly engineering management conference.

[2244. 68-2251. 62] We expect to complete the scheduled progress of this new Head Office building by the end of this year. [2251. 622-2254. 02] The above instructions are given in advance. [2254. 02-2254. 88] Thank you. [2255. 74-2253. 22] There are no further questions at this time. [2273. 222-2275. 38] The Q&A phase is one paragraph. [2275. 38-2278. 14] Thank you for your participation.

[2278. 14-2279. 70] The meeting ended today. [2279. 70-2280. 80] Thank you for your participation.
