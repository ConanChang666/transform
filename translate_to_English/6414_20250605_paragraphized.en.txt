The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript: [0. 00-5. 00] Invested in advanced to attend the second quarter of the Cathay Industry Forum in China. Today we are honored to invite speakers from China to speak to us. Now we have time to hand over to the spokesperson. Well, thank you for investing in advanced. So you don't need to link me.

I think there are a few of them that I've seen before, and I've seen them all before. That's why when I say something today, if you're not very clear about the process, or have never heard anything about it, let's talk about it.

So I will first focus on an overview of the company's development, and there is one of our business performance and development strategy. Then of course, we will know clearly that Chinese people seem to say that IPC in the world, we are in the IPC is not the same as IPC. So we will talk about what we are doing in the past and let everyone know more clearly.

In fact, I would like to share with you a look at our Q1 A-1, Q1 in May 19th. Now, we would like to share with you a look at a move across India throughout the first half of the year. In fact, in China, I would like to tell you the story, in China, the first time was in the field of audio technology, Spinoff came out, in the Red Sea in 2007, made an investment in the Red Sea. That Red Sea investment was the first, with a whole Supply Chain there was a manufacturing system to supply to China.

So we have this so-called Google, software and hardware integration, because we all know that IPC is a lot in the relation of computing systems, Intel that AMD. But in the case of the On architecture of Risk, it is also important to be on the edge computing. So we have MTK, so MTK is the second most important thing in MTK. That is what Google said to us, there are a lot of Google Engine Search tools, and then there are Cloud.

That's why we have so many departments in E-SaaS. That's what I can see here, in fact, the earliest Chinese design in the public. That's what we're talking about, and we're doing it through Hung Hai. So we're making a lot of things, like a financial retail here.

So now the game system is also doing very, relatively important a product line. There are other public like, network security, network communication. Then we all know that Ricky Electric, there are some smart homes, and some others. There are also machine vision. That machine vision, when the machine vision comes back, is also targeted, if you pay attention to the structure of the map, it is actually a subsidiary of our company, called super grace.

So we're at the edge of computing, on the machine vision, we've used a lot of solutions on this part of NVIDIA. There are some things I've just said, buildings, security, and intelligence. In the second, we're in this part of the brand channel, and we all know that it was from the BMW Spinoff. And of course, it's technology, and its technology is relatively high. That's Control.

That's the power of control, in fact, last year it was in IPC's No. 1 overall. It did about $600 billion last year, and it's already IPC's No. 1. That's what it did with that power, and it does with a lot of AIT hardware. There's nothing like space, military, medical, or rail transportation.

There are also some solutions, some software solutions. There are many of them, of course, but there are some boards in our traditional IPC. There are some Common Express boards in that board, or some boards, or systems, or 1U or 2U.

This is the most important part of our system integration process in Europe and the United States. It is also the Asia-Pacific system integration, I think we all know. That was the last part of our system integration process, because of the support of semiconductors, so we in this part of the system integration, we in the past, we may all think that there is only some engineering.

So, if we are talking about system integration as a kind of traditional one, we are talking about unpacking, engineering, and then integrating. Actually, we are a relatively different piece. So, let's give everyone a concept. This part of the story is what we're doing later, and we're talking about ESARs about nearly a year or two. So, if we hear a spell club in China often, we'll hear what we call ESARs. ESARS is Endocon Solution as a Service.

Endocon Solution, what is Solution. Solution is hardware software and services. I don't just talk about hardware and software. So in this section, we do about the top ten applications. The top ten are the smart home, smart building, smart park, smart medical, smart transportation. There may be some ESG energy carbon emissions.

I'm going to take a look below. That's what we're talking about overall, so we can see our entire transformation, from 1. 0, 2. 0 to 3. 0 now.

3. 0 is the development of this cloud service just said, so we will do the solution for the customer. That solution is hardware, hardware is the whole underlying architecture of the IPC we just talked about the first time, those Edge Computing, those boards, those chassis, those systems are China's own organs. We are equipped with our software, and then we have this hardware integration. That said, the group is now about 15000 people, which is about 5800 engineers, about 6000 engineers. So if you look at the whole, we are now a little different from the traditional IPC.

This is where I can see that the earliest Hon Hai invested in China in 2007, then our chairman began to take over this management. That can see the revenue at that time, we based on what we just said 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, every five years to do a transformation, we can see a growth of this organic industry, in fact, in 2014 when the market has made 5 billion. The 2015 and 16 started a bit of a double growth, then, of course, in late 2016, there was a conjure joining, so that is to see a jump, in addition to the growth of the industry itself there is a leap of growth.

That is, we are 42% of the revenues of KGAR, that is, if we are net profit, KGAR is the 10 years we have been in the 10 years we have been in the 22%. That last year's EBS statement was 20.03, that year we expect to have a growth, that is a stable number. So, of course, this part I said to be stable because we have a capital of last year to this year, we will have a slight adjustment, but this adjustment, we expect that this year is probably the whole capital of our capital will be about 13.75%, so this is probably a case of our EBS can be a stable growth. That is just mentioned, we have focused on our so-called integrated services, integrated services, we are focus on the top ten applications.

So we have a lot of success cases in many fields, which we have previously held a visit to the New Taipei City government, and I don't know at that time that everyone had the opportunity to visit the advanced. In fact, for example, in this smart park, we are now in Chiayi Horse Pay, then the whole solution after the horse pay is by Huahan, our group of subsidiaries brought in. The building and the energy of the smart building, we have done a lot of things not only for the city, the Taipei City government, and the Tzu Chi hospital, there are also a bunch of things like TSMC and TSMC's Hsinchu Park to help him.

This is what we are talking about. We are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about AI, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about AI.

We have done a lot of things in this section, then we have a lot of changes, then we have to do some discussion with our colleagues in the interior every day. That in the whole view, we can see that we have made some global layouts in response to tariffs and exchange rates. At the same time, of course, I have to first say that the impact of tariffs on China is basically almost nothing, because our shipping is FOB and S-Works, but we can not because of this, we say that we don't consider it, because we are still standing on the customer's position, because the customer will eventually choose an environmental factor that is good for it, so we in such a case.

We have also done a lot of work and a lot of simulations, including many places we know, from the original cheapest Vietnam to become the most expensive tariff, and then from the most expensive of China to Mr. Trump and China after a discussion, China has returned to a nearly stable range of control. That way, we can see that, in fact, we China here, whether it is the supply chain, whether it is the manufacturing base, we have made a lot of layouts around the world, such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, this is of course, in response to the tariffs, the local production, that we have in other regions, we have in Europe and Southeast Asia, we have China, Vietnam and Malaysia, there are those in Europe, we have Hungary, Germany, Austria, and Czech countries, we have in each region we have a major production base. In this case, we also expect that the capital of this year will be slightly adjusted, but this part of the figure basically depends on the growth, which is in line with our expectations, if Q1, the whole year is three green depth, that part is a lot of legal people ask China, in the past, we have had some of the three green part of the performance is not good, then of course, if you have been watching three green words for us seems not fair, because at that time we did a lot of layout, so now you can see we have EASAS, we have some points in the world, but we have to explain, but now we can see, this year, this year, the whole Q1 of our gross profit, the whole sales net and tax net profit, in fact, is an increase trend, that is a higher trend, then this part of the first of the first, in addition to the product, the second product, the second, the first, the second, the second is also we also said, we also we have a more is also a number of the most of the software, because of the integration of the year, because of this is a more.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged in chronological order into paragraphs.

First, I will check the transcription fragments provided to confirm the corresponding sentences for each timestamp. The fragments given by the user are from 1280. 00 to 1649. 00, with multiple entries. Each entry has a time range and corresponding sentences. My task is to arrange these sentences in chronological order and merge them into natural and smooth paragraphs, while keeping the original sequence and contents intact. Next, I need to determine how to segment them.

For example, a part of the High Mix manufacturing system may need to be merged into a paragraph, followed by a discussion about the 2. 0s and 3. 0s, then about the financial data of eSaaS, etc. It is important to note that each paragraph should revolve around a central thought to avoid jumping too far between sentences. At the same time, make sure not to miss any sentences. The user specifically states that nothing can be removed, so it is necessary to check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp to make sure that each sentence is correctly included. For example, the sentences "It is a high mix dig" must be placed at the beginning of the paragraph, followed by the sentences of 1283. 00 to 1287. 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, followed by such pushestions.

For example, when the speaker mentions "the age of 2.0", the next sentence is "just mentioned", which may need to be merged with the previous content in order to maintain the continuity of the context. When dealing with the financial data section, such as eSaaS revenue and gross margin, it needs to ensure the accuracy of the figures and percentages, and correctly segmented so that the reader can see clearly the changes and comparisons of the data. For example, for 2024 and 2025 comparisons, as well as revenue growth in different business segments, segmentation is required for readers to understand.

After completing these steps, I will read the entire converted text again, confirm that all the requirements have been met, no omissions or errors, and then submit the final result. </think> It is the excavation of high mix. This is not a general commercial some suppliers can do. So in the whole manufacturing system of the entire structure, it is necessary to do this adjustment, because the production line of a dragon in the past can be highly commendable, but you have no way in the IPC, you have to do your wire change very quickly, because your guests are changing their needs at any time.

When we first made this piece, then we gradually started to go to this 2. 0. That's the time when we just mentioned it, it was the time when we joined the company. At that time we had seen the importance of software, so many times, we would have the so-called comics race there will be some software added. You bought my comics race board, I have the software attached, and I can't let you go with it. But this is not enough, it's just a single thing, we're going to do in this 3. 0, 3. 0, we're going to start seeing 5G AI, and some applications moving forward.

This section is no longer just about doing AGE computing, AGE in the past, we're in the middle of this, middle here, but we're going to do a higher level of application. The application layer is all about talking about this, you see that the customer doesn't know what it is, he just tells you, I want to do my energy management, my labor costs can be reduced by 10%, my power can be reduced by 7%, my entire management, I want to see in my pause room, they only need to tell you about the needs and applications. How do we do this part of the flow control, how do I do it, how do I do this part of the distribution of the elevator, this part is what we do.

This is the first time that we have seen this, we can see that in this part of the speech, we can see that in the hand order is already 272 billion, the whole BP Ratio is 1.4, so we think that this year will be a big growth, and we are very active in the layout. This is the only thing I have mentioned about the product and why huahan to do this transformation, because it is not 10 to 25% of its gross profit, then huahan to do some hard integration, I have a chance to do 25 to 35%, but if I go up in 2024, I will include some of the integrated services, I can do 35% or even higher. 4%, it seems that there is nothing to feel, but sorry, because your master base is very large, base is a big increase, so in fact, it is only a 1% increase, compared to 1000 billion views, it is relatively large increase. Here to see the AI, that is to say, we last year in 2024 a revenue is about 1.21 billion, that this year, in Q1 is about 33.6 billion, that 33.6 billion, that last year the same year is about 19.8 billion, so it is about 69. 7%, then I have to talk about our AI in the words, we have two pieces, one is on the end of the cloud database, one on the edge computing that one, then AI in the past AI might see the words.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase script: [1649. 00-1652. 00] is what is inside this block. We are exploring this section. This section deals with concepts such as server, station, and device. [1652. 00-1656. 00] is like a server or station and device. What do these concepts mean?

We need to understand these concepts in order to explore further. [1656. 00-1657. 00] You will say what is strange. You may be surprised because there is also a server in China. [1657. 00-1658. 00] You also do server in China. Yes, we also do server in China. [1658. 00-1659. 00] We also do server in China.

We also do server. [1659. 00-1660. 00] We have. We have our own server. [1660. 00-1662. 00] But we are not pretending to be false. Our server is not pretending to be false. [1662. 00-1664. 00] Or electronic five brothers.

Or, as they say, "What are they doing?" or "What are they doing?" or "What are they doing?" or "What are they doing?" or "What are you doing?" or "What are you doing?" or "What are you doing?" or "What are you doing?" or "What are you doing?"

This server is a commercial type. [1670. 00-1671. 00] and then standard. These servers are standard. [1671 00-1674. 00] Our word is more robust. Our server is more robust. [1674. 00-1677. 00] and then compares against them.

Our server is for a specific application environment. [1677. 00-1679. 00] Their application environment is done. Our server is for a specific application environment. [1679. 00-1681. 00] That is to have one. We need to have a special design. [1681. 00-1682. 00] The different designs.

We need a special design. [1682. 00-1683. 00] Maybe he wants a fanless design. A fanless design may be required. [1683. 00-1684. 00] Or high temperature resistance. Or a high temperature resistant design. [1684. 00-1686. 00] Or he can be.

Or you need a design that can run in a special environment. [1686. 00-1689. 00] The life of the product can be longer. We need to design a server that can run in a special environment and have a long life. [1689. 00-1691. 00] The other end of the cloud.

In addition to the cloud end. [1691 00-1694. 00] This piece is like the one we have with this database. We have these database on the cloud end. [1694. 00-1696. 00] Then there is some where the application is. We also have application. [1696. 00-1700. 00] There are some interfaces of the API.

We also have API and interface. [1700. 00-1704. 00] This is a Chinese injection. These are Chinese injections. [1704. 00-1706. 00] Just this page has actually spoken to you. Just this page has already spoken to you. [1706. 00-1704. 00] We are now.

We are currently. [1707. 00-1709. 00] We have been talking about multi-angles. We have been talking about multi-angles. [1709. 00-1711. 00] We are talking about product applications. We are talking about product applications. [1711. 00-1712. 00]

That's what we're talking about. [1712. 00-1714. 00] We're talking about the product market. We're talking about the product market. [1714. 00-1716. 00] There are also some directions for services. We also have some directions for services. [1716. 00-1718. 00] So we've jumped out of the past.

We have jumped out of the past. [1718. 00-1719. 00] We don't. We don't. We don't. [1719. 00-1720. 00] We think I'm FOP. We think we're FOP. [1720. 00-1722. 00] I'm not aware of the delivery to the port.

We have only brought the goods to the port, and we have not forgotten him. [1722. 00-1723. 00] There is no such thing. [1723. 00-1726. 00] We now provide a service to our customers in the area. We now provide a service to our customers in the area. [1726. 00-1729. 00] Customers can activate at any time.

Guests can activate at any time. [1729. 00-1730. 00] He targets the European market. He targets the European market. [1730. 00-1732. 00] He can activate my Hungary at any time. He can activate my Hungary at any time. [1732. 00-1734. 00] He targets the China Asia Pacific market.

[1734. 00-1736. 00] He can be activated at any time. He can be activated at any time. [1736. 00-1737. 00] Regardless of whether he is. [1737. 00-1739. 00] Everyone has recently traveled to Vietnam.

Everyone recently traveled to Vietnam. [1739. 00-1740. 00] or Malaysia. [1740. 00-1742. 00] or in the country of China. Or in the country of China. [1742. 00-1743. 00] If that is against the United States.

That is, if it is against the United States. [1743. 00-1746. 00] He can also launch these in the United States at any time. He can also launch these in the United States at any time. [1746. 00-1749. 00] These supply chains. [1749. 00-1750. 00] Even manufacturing centers.

Even the manufacturing center. [1750. 00-1754. 00] I would like to share with you. It would like to share with you. [1754. 00-1757. 00] A look forward to the first half of the year. A look forward to the first half of the year. [1757. 00-1759. 00] Speaking at this stage.

[1759. 00-1761. 00] Of course, the Chinese individual is a N client. Of course, the Chinese individual is a N client. [1761. 00-1762. 00] The N client. That N client. [1762. 00-1763. 00] We mentioned last year.

We mentioned it last year. [1763. 00-1765. 00] Because we are already one. Because we are already one. [1765. 00-1767. 00] An exclusive supplier of one global one. [1767. 00-1769. 00] So what we are talking about in this piece.

So let's talk about this. [1769. 00-1774. 00] We have added an order that is so-called a 1.6 billion expected. We have added a 1.6 billion expected order. [1774. 00-1775. 00] A conservative estimate. [1775. 00-1777. 00] A conservative estimate of the 1.6 billion orders.

The words of those 1.6 billion orders. [1777. 00-1780. 00] was originally hoped for the second time this year. Originally hoped for the second time this year. [1780. 00-1781. 00] The third quarter began. [1781. 00-1783. 00] But now there is a slight later.

But now there is a little later. [1783. 00-1784. 00] The main factor is. The main factor is a tariff policy on the side of Trump. [1784. 00-1786. 00] A tariff policy on the side of Trump. [1786. 00-1789. 00] A change in their internal situation.

[1789. 00-1792. 00] So he made some adjustments to the client. So he made some adjustments to the client. [1792. 00-1794. 00] The second word is in the public prosecution of this piece. The second word is in the public prosecution of this piece. [1794. 00-1795. 00] The public prosecution of this piece.

That's what the public says. [1795. 00-1798. 00] We'll continue to do this in AI. We'll continue to do this in AI. [1798. 00-1800. 00] And Wang Annet's wisdom people. And Wang Annet's wisdom people. [1800. 00-1803. 00]

Financial dining and home continues to ponder. [1803. 00-1807. 00] That's what we're going to focus on for the last month. That's what we're going to focus on for the last month. [1807 00-1809. 00] The rest of the month in May will be announced. [1809. 00-1810. 00] That's what we're seeing too.

That's what everyone can see. [1810. 00-1812. 00] We have a public culture in May. Our public culture in May. [1812. 00-1814. 00] It's a double-digit. It's a double-digit. [1814. 00-1816. 00] A high double-digit growth.

A high double-digit growth. [1816. 00-1818. 00] That's why there is a layout in this section. That's why there's a layout in this section. [1818. 00-1820. 00] We will continue to be on top of this force. We will continue to be on top of this force. [1820. 00-1822. 00]

That's what system integration is all about. [1822. 00-1826. 00] is one that benefits the entire TSMC to North America. It is one that benefits the entire TSMC to North America. [1826. 00-1828. 00] An additional investment. [1828. 00-1829. 00] So here I am.

So here I am. [1829. 00-1831. 00] will increase this part of the order. This will increase this part of the order. [1831. 00-1833. 00] If that part of the brand channel. That part of the brand channel. [1833. 00-1834. 00] I just mentioned.

I just mentioned it. [1834. 00-1837. 00] It is mainly in Europe. It is mainly in Europe. [1837. 00-1840. 00] It has a lot of orbits with these defenses. It has a lot of orbits with these defenses. [1840. 00-1843. 00] These requirements for these navigators.

These are the requirements of these carriers. [1843. 00-1846. 00] It included that it also invested in a family last year. It included that it also invested in a family last year. [1846. 00-1849. 00] One of Europe Germany did. [1849. 00-1852. 00] As a Green technology company.

The company that made Green technology. [1852. 00-1854. 00] If you look at the news, you'll see it. If you look at the news, you'll see it. [1854. 00-1856. 00] I had an announcement. At that time we made an announcement. [1856. 00-1858. 00]

[1858. 00-1860. 00] is the part of the electric pile. It is the part of the electric pile. [1860. 00-1862. 00] The profit was originally obtained as a Poche. The profit was originally obtained as a Poche. [1862. 00-1864. 00] B&W also had a Holo order.

B&W has a Holo order. [1864. 00-1868. 00] That's what we're looking forward to this year. That's what we're looking forward to this year. [1868. 00-1871. 00] That's what we're just talking about at the end of this esos. That's what we're talking about. [1871 00-1872. 00] That's what we're talking about.

[1872. 00-1876. 00] We are now also with some channel operators. We are also with some channel operators. [1876. 00-1879. 00] Some e-commerce companies are doing communication. Some e-commerce companies are doing communication. [1879. 00-1881. 00] The order is expected.

The order is expected. [1886-1884. 00] We will be able to announce it soon. We will also announce it soon. [1884. 00-1886. 00] This part of the story. That part of the story. [1886-1888. 00] Except for that one.

[1888. 00-1890. 00] The original a la carte. The original a la carte. [1890. 00-1892. 00] contains a la carte like in New Taipei City or Taipei City. It contains a la carte like in New Taipei City or Taipei City. [1892. 00-1894. 00] Or after a horse-riding.

Or after a horse cavalry. [1894. 00-1896. 00] After that we will do a whole. After that we will do a whole. [1896. 00-1898. 00] One network. One network. [1898. 00-1899. 00] One network.

One. [1899. 00-1901. 00] is a way of speaking. It is a chain. It is a chain. [1901. 00-1904. 00] is a chain. [1904. 00-1907. 00] is a whole energy management of this part.

So this part of the whole energy management. [1907. 00-1908. 00] will be a chain. It will be a chain. [1908. 00-1911. 00] It will be shared with you soon. It will soon be shared with you. [1911. 00-190. 00] That is to say, if the H1 operating outlook.

That's what you can see from your H1 operating outlook. [1919. 00-1923. 00] I estimate the average share we estimate for H1. I estimate the average share we estimate for H1. [1920. 00-1923. 00] It is estimated that the average share we estimate for H1. [1923. 00-1927. 00] is approximately 1.375 billion.

This is 13. 75. That is 13. 75. [1930. 00-1932. 00] The share capital is 13. 75. The share capital is 13. 75. The share capital is 13. 75.

We are currently looking at the entire operating income as well. [1937. 00-1939. 00] then the gross profit is also slightly. Then the gross profit is also slightly. [1939. 00-1940. 00] That the operating net profit is also. That the operating net profit is the same. [1940. 00-1941. 00] The tax is the same.

It is also after the tax. [1941. 00-1943. 00] The US stock market is also open. The US stock market is also open. [1943. 00-1944. 00

We expect some CB conversions this year, so looking at the expected end of the year, the number of shares is about 1.45 billion shares, that the total share capital is about 14.5, but this share capital if you say that you do not know what kind of changes in the future, the rate of exchange is what it is, because we have made some internal simulations and corresponding methods, so we believe that we are in a very objective direction to grow. That if we look at all the year, we think that we are relatively strong with public control and brands, then we expect it to be more stable, then the whole discussion is that if H2 and H1, compared to H2, we think we are equal or even higher, then the average speaking is that we will talk about, because we do not know what kind of changes in the future tariff, what the exchange rate is what it is, but we actually have some kind of the impact on the most of the most of the stock. The Group has more than 6000 engineers in terms of research and development investment, we have been investing in this part of the technology, in addition to the existing machine vision, including in the liquid equipment, we also did some large number of talents, including technology, some strategic partners of the joint research and development, so this one can see that in fact in 24 years our research and development investment is about 116 billion, then the year-on-year growth of 2.7 billion, then the whole financial report accounted for about 9 to 10%, the overall market value of the group is about 1361 billion, so it is pretty much like a small share, then such a sound financial situation, then can be with investors to grow together, then we want to optimize such a condition is a mutually beneficial state.

That I would like to ask you, then I would like to ask you, because in the past, we may not know very much about China, I think we talk a lot of points, and then I don't understand, because a lot of Falun Gong people in our private exchange, when we ask us what is the difference between China and the general IPC, then I don't know how I complement our overall service and business model.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user, sorting them into paragraph texts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any original text, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I check the texts provided by the user in a few sentences, paying attention to the timestamp and corresponding sentences. In the example given by the user, some sentences have time intervals, such as [2402. 00-2404. 00-2404. 00] and [2404. 00-2406. 00-2406. 00] are continuous, while others have interval, such as [2408. 00-2408. 00-2410. 00].

First, I will merge the continuous timestamps into paragraphs. For example, the sentence that begins with [2402. 00-2404. 00]: "There is no comparison between productism and the next [2404. 00-2406. 00]: "Advanced knowledge" is obviously a continuation of the same topic and should be merged into a paragraph. Next, [2408. 00-2410. 00]: "So everyone" may be the beginning of a new paragraph, but needs to see whether the context is coherent.

In addition, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any sentences", so even if some sentences do not look coherent or duplicated, they must be retained. For example, [2674. 00-2676. 00]: "There is another one" may be a transition sentence that needs to be kept in paragraphs. During the process, pay attention to the coherence of punctuation symbols and sentences. For example, some sentences may end with commas or sentences, and some may not have to add appropriate punctuation according to the context, but the user requests do not rewrite the content, so that only the original punctuation points or judge the paragraphs according to the timestamps.

After finishing the preliminary finishing, I will read the whole paragraph verbatim again to make sure that all sentences are correctly arranged without missing or wrong combinations. Make sure that each paragraph meets the user's requirements, i.e. not deleting, changing, or composing anything, while maintaining readability. </think> The following is the paragraph verbatim verb after re-arranging the original verbatim content (fully retaining all the original sentences, adjusting the paragraph structure according to semantic and timestamp logic): --- Is there a more advanced understanding of productism?

That's what we're talking about in China, we're targeting three big things: smart manufacturing, smart city and ESG. That's where we're at, and we've cut out dozens of other industries. So we know that there's no problem, so we've always designed our own production issues, but we still need people to follow the whole service, which is what our customers want. So he can find China, he can get all the complete service, he doesn't need to say to find a vendor, maybe a SI, another SI, and then another hardware vendor to do the service.

This should be in the first half of next year? Well, the cycle he has achieved is about 6 to 9 months a term. So for now, we are now entering June, and he is expected to Q1 next year. Well, because the customer is also about 6 to 9 months a PO, to this extent, because this growth is very fast, because his base is relatively small, what will he look like in two or three years?

The NCR has just mentioned that this is actually the NCR, so I don't want to reply to your questions first. The NCR part of the NCR, in fact, we've been doing NCR products in Hungary, but we've been working on a so-called global hardware yoga process with NCR last year. So we've been working on some new projects in the discussion with our customers, and we think there's going to be a new order for these new projects in the first half of this year.

The brand said, because Q1 is a relatively low base period, but usually if you look at the brand channel, he will usually be a faster jump in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So we expect him to talk about this year, his Gidance is relatively upstairs. That's why we expect him to see the system integration, he has always been relatively stable and stable, so he looks at it, because he has been relatively high in the last few years, so his base base has expanded to the relatively large, and here we expect that he should be a stable growth this year.

There is no specific time to add to this? Is there a specific time for the tenth season of the customer will be delayed? Because there is a lot of phone, 90 days and 10 years old, then there is no time for the company to tell us that the disease is detailed in the second level? This 1.6 billion I must first say that he has a lot of projects, then this part I do not know Ryan do you have any idea or can share?

- **Collaboration Description**: 1. Keep all the original sentences in accordance with the timestamp and semantic logic. 2. Do not delete any repeated, paused, or incomplete statements (such as "that", "right", etc.). 3. Keep the original punctuation and tone (such as "?,", "!,", ",", etc.).

4. Combine the continuous timestamp content clearly belonging to the same paragraph and separate the topics with the paragraph separator.

He has a tax condensed effect on him. That's what the supply chain needs to do as well. That's what the supply chain and manufacturing says. That's not to say that the migration can be produced today. That's just a small question, what will change in the near future.

We are now planning this year, as we have already calculated, that is, we are now in the hands of the unconverted CD, all to do a situation, to change the word. It seems as if because of the time relationship, no problem, if you have any questions, we can write to us, we will answer.
