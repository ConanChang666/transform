Let's talk about our financial situation. The first quarter of the situation. You guys are advanced. That's why I came here to report it to you. The first quarter of the financial situation. The first quarter revenue is 29.08 billion.

That's 4Q29.83 billion. The revenue portion is down 2.5%. That's in the gross profit margin. The gross profit margin for this quarter is 27.7%. That's 25.8%. The gross profit margin is 1.9%.

That's part of the operating fee rate. This quarter is 13. 7%. The previous quarter was 13%. The last quarter was 14. 1%. The net operating profit was 409 million.

The outer part of the industry is about 2 billion 6600. The proportion is about 9.1%. The 4Q is about 1.1.6 million. The total tax net profit is 583 million. The EPS is 2.79. The main industry will increase more reasons.

There are a few. That first part. Of course, the exchange and the evaluation of financial assets. It comes mainly from the exchange. The second part is because we are in the first quarter. We have a field.

Of course. We have a field. We have an idle factory in the middle position area. So there is a fixed asset income. There is also some interest income. So it is a long time outside the industry.

There is a significant increase. Overall, the tax net profit is 2.79. EPS is 2.79. Let's look at the comparison with YY. That is.

You said we just mentioned 29.08 billion in the first quarter. That was about a drop of 2.1% compared to last year. That was in the gross profit margin section. It was generally flat compared to last year's EQ. About 27. 7%.

That's not too much of a difference. 23. 7% of the total tax net profit. Compared to the same period last year, it's almost 6 percent growth. That's why it's so much growth.

I am a part of you, I am a part of you, I am a part of you, because we ask some fixed assets. Below we look at the balance sheet part. That cash is now about 28.3 billion dollars.

That is about financial assets. The part of the liquid financial assets. About 57 billion. That suddenly increased so much. That is the financial assets. This is actually the concept of fixed-income.

Here is the option. Simple part of cash. So overall. We are looking at it together. So the whole ratio is speaking. Cash is about the part of cash.

About 23 percent of the week's billed portion is 21.69 billion. Occurrence 0.68. Inventory portion is similar to last year.

Also about 4.8%. Fixed assets are 110.85 billion. That's a 6 drop. That's mainly because of some depreciation. Lands continue to expire. The five-line assets are 81.86 billion.

The total asset is 363.96 million. The portion of that liability is 105.92 million. The debt ratio is 29.18. The common interest is about 3.6 million. The depreciation cost for that quarter is 349 million.

The capital expenditure is 58 million. HBD is 10.87 billion. That's the whole capital expenditure. Our total capital expenditure is 10.900 million in 2024. That's the part of Q1 in 2025. The whole capital expenditure is down to about 58 million.

The above is for the first quarter. The financial revenue report. Thank you. Next, I will report to you our Business Update. The revenue for the first quarter is 29.08 billion. This is a decrease of 2.5% compared to the previous quarter.

That was a bit better than our initial Guidance. The YOY was also about 2% lower. Speaking of RF Modules, QOQ was a 23% growth. Our guests mostly grew. Our light communication guests.

This year also looks like a guest. In our RF Module revenue. It will turn from the second to the first. That is to say, the growth of light will be faster than our Dip. Next, the Hybrid Module is negative 5%.

This is because the Hybrid module has a lot of pressure sensor modules in the automotive industry. It looks like this first quarter of the year will be more stable than last year. That surrounding subject is flat. QOQ is flat. It should be slowly rebounded in the second quarter.

That image sensor. The image sensor is negative 8%. This is the main or seasonal factor. One of our mobile applications. It has seasonal factors. So it decreases by 8%.

That's when I thought I'd take a slow turn from the second quarter. Our total revenue. The car was probably maintained or about three minutes later. The other changes were not very large. It was about the same as the first quarter. That looks like the second quarter should still be slightly higher than the first quarter.

Thank you to our boss for this. This is an overview of your business. We are now open for Q&A. You can enter your question in the on-screen dialog box.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. At present, about 13.6% of the stock price of Q1 is about the month. So this year's view on the tax rate is about 14.8% of the group. Thank you. Is there a chance for a low-track satellite product to grow this year?

So we still have more of this number than last year's launch. Of course, the company has been improving the new design to make this product easier. But overall, it should still grow this year. That's the question of price, of course, every customer expects a certain amount of price drop every year that we will also work with.

Therefore, there should be no impact on the gross profit margin. Therefore, the gross profit margin should not be affected. Therefore, the gross profit margin should not be affected. Is there any change in export tariffs for the four major products of Wu? What is the difference between this tariff for Taiwan and the Philippines?

I would like to know if there are any changes to the tax rate that we are dealing with in the past, and if there are any changes to the tax rate we are dealing with in the future, we would like to know if we have any changes to the tax rate that we are dealing with in the future. We would like to know if there are any changes to the tax rate that we are dealing with in the future.

But if we have to go to the United States to communicate with them in the future, I think it is better for our colleagues in the Philippines to go to the United States than to communicate with them in the future because English is their first language so moving the pace of the Philippines does not change the pace of the original plan to continue moving part of the production, especially the mature products. We will continue to progress in this place, so we will continue to progress, because we will continue to progress in this place, so we will continue to progress, so we will continue to progress in this place.

What is the power factor to get rid of the unexpectedly part of the business? One of the major factors in this attack is that Thorson tax has reduced Intermediate investment, of course, to detect the personal property interest rate if the customer changes near Viel. Does the company see the customer's pre-stocking in the second quarter? This just means that I did not see the customer's pre-stocking I did not see the customer's pre-stocking changes, which means that we did not see the customer's pre-stocking so far with the current behavior of the same business and our customers did not see this.

Of course, we are mainly producing 400G products that we are developing to bring samples to 800G, but now we have to meet with them at the same time to attend the OFC Optical Fibro Communication, the world's largest optical exhibition with customers in face-to-face communication, they want us to accelerate at the same time in addition to 800G, and then the development of 1.6G also began to accelerate the sound of this optical communication should be relatively rapid.

However, some slow, may be a relatively small proportion, or even a single digit of such things, especially like cars, especially Japanese customers' car products, that time is relatively long. We will continue to promote, hoping that the Philippine products can at least be a similar proportion to Taiwan as soon as possible, this is our goal. Is there a new situation in the car ceramic substrate? Is there a recovery for the car needs? Yes, our car products are mainly a European-system guest, a beauty guest, of course we are also actively expanding the customer of the day, progress is good, of course, they are slow, but I think that the second half of the year should be slowly introduced into production.

At the same time, we also actively contact China's leading electric vehicle manufacturers, of course, if the speed of the start, then his requirements are very electric, so our colleagues should increase the flexibility of this capacity to improve a lot than before, this is a challenge for us, but we should also work hard. I think that the company in the raycommunal communication 800G and 1. 6T should be able to contribute to the beginning of next year, 1. 6T may be a little slow, but it is also possible that guests want him in advance, and may also have a little contribution in the second half of next year.

We will continue to do a lot of things, but sometimes we will continue to do, but we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do, we will continue to do. Here want to ask the company's export to the United States revenue share about how much?

This year, it looks like the tariff problem, so it is not accurate, but the basic idea is also the same as last year I thought it was almost the same pattern, will not be the same as the last two or three years before the third quarter, the decline in the fourth quarter, should not be the same. So my house in the fourth quarter todavía without Плллоbing, actually will be a little shaker for the decline, many people say that I am you 1300m droite, ッ�ン・jenúp・rec Tucker, in the hotel video less such, what is even if it is a ousside channel.
