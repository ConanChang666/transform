Thank you all. I am now evaluating the experience notification. First, let's look at the performance of our company's products on the job application. In the touch products part of our collection is 80%. The touch products part of the occupation is 18%.

The occupation of touch is 24%. The occupation of touch-enabled brands is 11%. The portion of touch-enabled products is 12% of the occupation of devices. The occupation of companies and affiliates is 3%.

Let's take a look at the strength chart for the first quarter of revenue. We first saw the comparison of YYY. We all know that in the first quarter it was. The tough burden of electronic consumer products. But at the first quarter last year's table it was held. We've mentioned it before.

The first quarter of last year was the first quarter of this year. Because the brand's reciprocity is uncertain about the tariff policy. So there are some actions that have been made ahead of time to improve the order. That's how much we've earned in the first quarter. Compared to the same period last year.

It reached 31 billion 1900 million. And the gross profit margin part. Because of the company's touch panel module and touch electric products.

Gross margin continued to increase. So the gross margin in the first quarter was up to 50.1%. This figure is a new high since the 15 quarters. Compared to the same period last year.

The OPEX for this quarter is 7179 million. It is a few decreases compared to the same period last year. It is mainly the same period last year. The cost of the speculative spread shares. See also the portion of the operating profit margin.

In the first quarter, the operating profit margin was 785 million. Compared to last year's 64900 million. An annual increase of 21%. Overall, we are part of our industry. Whether it is revenue or gross profit margin. Or above the industry economy.

That's because the entire tariff policy is determined. There is a decline in the entire global stock market. So we're on top of the financial asset evaluation. There are also some losses. While there are some gains in the first quarter.

But the whole or some is affected. So we are in a non-business part. There are some 6000 62 million losses. The first quarter of the tax before the best. It came 719 million. The post-tax economy part is 149 million.

Earnings per share is 1.92%. Next we see the QOF portion. This year's first quarter compared to last quarter. Our competition is 2.7%. The revenue above the competition is 2.7%. That's in the gross profit margin.

The first quarter of this year. Compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The increase is 0.5%. The part of OPEX. The first quarter of this year.

So the fees in the first quarter were above. Compared to last year's fourth quarter. That was a down of 0.85%. On the operating rate. It was also an increase of 8.7%.

The first quarter keeps up with the quarter. On top of the industry, whether it's revenue, gross profit margin, or the economy of the industry. It's the fourth quarter of last year's growth.

Next, let's look at the part of the asset liability. The company's cash. Return to cash. About $7303 billion.

In addition, capital contribution is 1.1 billion of the capital. The retained surplus is 58 billion. 58 billion. 99 million. The other reason. The company has a joint venture with investment funds. Some of the expensive and new shares.

Non-corporate sale. Financial assets part. is a capital of 310 million. Other. Negative debt part. is 808 3300 million.

In other words, we see. The economy of this period is 719 million. In business activities. Fresh cash flow part. There is a relatively large fee.

It is a reduction in oil animal liability. This part, mainly because of payment. Revolutionary maintenance company. It is in the first quarter of each year. There will be employees.

This annuity bonus. Performance fund needs. So this part of the fee. In the investment project. The baseline cash flow section. There are two more important fees.

The ratio is 400,32 million. The other part is 7 billion. The time deposit expires. The cash capacity of the transfer investor. And the financing activities.

I'm talking about the second quarter of the brand, and I've been keeping an eye on this financial trading deal recently.

We also have a financial trade agreement. We are in this agreement. We are part of the liability of the trade agreement. Our main HI. Tariff policy.

Our clients. Also. Public relations market. Or the entire operations office above. Our company keeps tracking.

Customer needs, hope, the first time can be met.

Customer requirements. But the entire MD market. Windows 10 company security needs. Take a long time to look at. I think this season is causing demand. Trends go a bit further.

That's what we currently know. Expected revenue in hot season. Between 31 to 3.2 billion dollars. Grocery Market. We're between 48% and 51%. Open Market.

It will fall between 21.8% and 26%. Last quarter's legal meeting. We talk about it. After the pandemic, there is a chance to go to the computer field.

Can you give me a bit of a hint, but no.

Here is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraph type:. You see what happens on the mainland network. Thank you. For this year, of course, a computer court in mainland was the biggest one for me. That is Demo Day.

This is the best opportunity for us to come up with some new products that we have recently developed. Including products that work strategically with them, or products that we work strategicly with other customers. Then the fermentation that we can see is the part of the date that was mentioned by the spokesperson just this year.

That's what we do. That's what we do. That's what we can see. In fact, it's the place where the show is different from the previous year. We often hit the booth and then there's an electric power car inside. Then we'll tell you about some of our related products.

So there are some PC-related products, some of which I have reported before, and some of which are related to MEDA and AI, or sometimes we are afraid because of the fact that there are times when we talk about CNN, so there's no chance of progress, because the car is slowly going to the second half and as long as the second half is going to mass production on the road. So this time I see the time to do some more openings. Good thing I'm going to split the first part of my talk about PC-related products to tell everyone about what we've done in the PC-related product.

The first major product line in the PC is the input power of the input power you want to experience in some multi-module is that we add some more touch applications in this place. I just want to say that our products also need to be modified if there is something to be discussed with us before this is also possible for customers to measure it is that if you use the part of the stylus, I would point out that if you use the part of the stylus, you will find that there is a possible difference in the middle of a possible difference between your bottom and your own bottom, because many factors such as Curtrae reaction speed, etc. There will be the difference, if you want to sell the eggs in Apple products, you will find its difference is very short or small because it is really famous, because Apple is well known that it is to be used to disassembled with similar technology, so we will not use some PC customers say that some PC users will say that it is the next time?

If you want to buy a new laptop, it is very high in the mouse usage, that is, I want to buy a laptop, I want to do some presentation or what, that is, I want to decide the way that you buy a laptop, that is, I want to buy a laptop, then you can the mouse features, it is a set, then I buy it, it is an interview, then it is a talk, then you buy it after you buy it, you don't like it, we don't like it, it's just a talk, it's a thing, we're just talk, it's not a thing, it's a lot, it's not a thing, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it is a lot, it's a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is a So I also want to use this, an academic, that is, a laboratory, the way they go to learn, to learn, their, different shapes, then, let them use, touch things, is more smooth, that is, in fact, in fact, it may be said, the market may be, a year of the PC market, actually not much, but I found a lot of customers because now, we have been pushing, is the CSR, is, Forward, this part, this part, or the ESG part, Sustainability, or from the CSR point of view, or the ESG point of view, the customer is also watching, is our products, not to say that his products, painting, floating, so we can usually use, can feel, another, there are some special needs, but also can, can, and then find the people help us, continue to teach, help us to do the design. Then, then, NB, No-bond Design, last, , , , , , er, experimental function, I think, a bit, before, can have been in the market, has been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been in the market, we have been to say it, it, it, it, whether it is, whether it is, we have been in the A, it is, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is, we have been in the big, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is in the A, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is, it is, whether it is a lot in the A, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is, it is, we have been in the A, whether it is, the A, we have a lot in the A, we have been, whether it is, we have been, we have been said, we have been, we have been, we have been, we have been, we have been said, we have been, it is, we have, the same, the A, we have, we have, the A, we have, it is, we have been, whether it is, we have, it is, the same, we have been, we have been,

Here is the transcription of the re-routing paragraph type: What is the benefit of this? Of course, the benefit is that we don't have to worry about talking about network problems, charging problems, and so on. Well, even a good question, we can help you plug in and then come back to the Logix Marks that you are running, and we can get you to work directly. That part we have nothing to do with, mainly because a lot of customers are taking this direction in the direction of electric transport, especially in the part of the Distilled chat.

If you want to know more about this, it is not a matter of course, but it is not a matter of privacy, but it is not a matter of privacy, you know that each user of the fingerprint itself is a lot of the fingerprint, so we most of these videos, they just talked about editing operations to strengthen the whole social interview is another part of the actual part of the second part, you can see that we will have some new features of the fingerprint after the release of some couriers. So I just wanted to let you analyze this, that is not necessarily the first time that you want to open the front door of the phone or a different fingerprint can be used by the front door, so I feel that the first time is whether you are on the front door or the front door, and then slowly feel that the wrist pain is missing, and then slowly put the memory on the memory stick.

It's an electronic color technology, so there's no way for us to think about it because they're all electrolytes before they're used and now they're moving to electric, so we're seeing that it's supposed to be car-like cooperation. It's the whole series from E2R, so we're talking about direct flying dogs, and then we're grabbing them. Of course, I'm all concerned that the first Milano customer in the world can say that there's a constant contact there is a NDA problem there, and what Sanitain can report there's a problem where I'm going to try to make progress without violating the NDA. The next word is that we're going to be in Singapore, and we're going to provide the state of staying on the line.

This is why I just said that it's waterproof and not binary. It's another word for car oil here. We have to do it here. It's not like the Internet or the car oil. It's not like the Internet or the car oil. It's the same thing as the Internet or the car oil. It's the same thing as the external oil. We're going to use it to develop this product because it's not a driver IC or a single driver IC or any other chain we think we're going to say that we're going to find a market that we're going to consume the value of the so-called driver, or do it not do it in the whole form, so this market is also disturbing our public brand.

Then you can have a different way of living pressure to control it, that is, have done a start of 15,000 parts. And that is the part of the car, that is on the road, and now there is a small car, that is, you have to open it, it will talk about Tesla, you have to take it all the way. Then Tesla said it was very competitive, but you don't have the hair of the situation, so I don't dare. I can now see this demo, we can measure it for five or five years, then it can be partitioned, so don't be a tenth or eight percent, you want to do these things with the i-me or youtube of the house.

The first part of the study, we will repair the car, that is in this car, this electric motorcycle, there are a few points: the first part of the first we will repair our ADAS WT5, first give me a joke, ADAS WT5, this second half of the year will smooth the road, this is the first. So the part of the ADAS 2,2box is now in research and development, then we hope to wait until the end of the research and development, to finish, through the prototype can make these original is MIMO Live2 this program, there is actually the first one, the first big announcement.

The last question I have about this is the part of the smart traffic, which we already have in the cloud cover, so you talk about the most common catch is the people who are afraid of the big network, that is, one day people are on the big network, and then there is a car is on the big park or the forest forest to see the crash back. The fact that you are right at the time, you can do something, you can do a route will also crash back, then we are in the cloud cover implementation of the current cloud cover has been developed, and in fact, in fact, it is that we are actually using this A-SOL, that is, this is our natural network, and then it is generally the big network of the natural network, this will be green, and then what is the normalization of people is is the red, so we use some color to do some coding, which is to reduce the accident of the big network.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the script snippet provided to see if there is a timestamp or other markup that needs to be processed. Each entry has a time range, such as [2160. 00-2162. 00], but the user may want to remove these timestamps and only retain the conversation content. However, the user does not explicitly specify whether a timestamp is needed, but according to the treatment in the example, it may only need to retain the conversation content itself. Next, I need to sort the content corresponding to each timestamp and merge it into a natural paragraph based on the context. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic, should be linked together, and some may be different topics that require segmentation.

These parts may require segmentation processing. During the process, make sure not to miss any sentences while keeping the sequence of the sentences intact. For example, the user mentions, "Why should it be judged to exceed people", and then "Why", and then "if it is here today", which should be linked together to form a coherent paragraph.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to repeated or redundant sentences, such as "one route" repeated four times, must be kept in full, can not be deleted. At the same time, some sentences may be incomplete, such as "it can only be", need to be kept as, without modification. When dealing with technical terms or terminology, such as "Travel for Road", "E-Pay", "Home Call", etc., to ensure correct spelling and formatting, to keep the same as.

In addition, pay attention to the use of punctuation symbols, such as Chinese sentences, commas, etc. Finally, check whether the whole paragraph is smooth, meet the requirements of the user, make sure that there is no missing content, and each sentence is arranged in the original order. When finished, read again to confirm that there is no error, such as whether the timestamp is handled correctly, whether the sentence is coherent, whether the punctuation is correct, etc.

This allows us to generate paragraph-by-text transcripts that meet the user's requirements. </think> The following is a paragraph-by-text transcript that follows the reordering of the original transcript (totally keeping all the original sentences, undeleted/rewritten/condensed/condensed): Why do we have to judge it to be more than human? This is because if today's here red, that's red, we're red, we're green, and then we can absorb, we're calling it when we're called to run, but we find that this car really doesn't end, it's not end, it's not end, it's not end, it's even irradiated, it's even very good, it's been irradiated, it's just a very good, it's only going to the past.
