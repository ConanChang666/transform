First of all, I would like to tell you about today's agenda: First of all, we will be briefed by our financial advisor, Mr. Hou, by our general manager, Mr. Chen Ruihe, to answer your questions. Now to get into today's agenda, we would like to ask Mr. Hou to report about the operation.

This is where we can see that our main products have some special paper label paper, as well as carton cardboard and some recycled materials. Below we can see that we are mainly the ginger paper factory of Lingjiang paper can. Next page is the company's current investment structure and the holding of the subsidiary, with the listing law fees and reports and so on.

Our investment structure is to invest through Huafeng investment. If we have five production bases here, we can see that there are nine production bases in Kaohsiung, and nine production bases in Taiwan, as well as Dingfeng factory in Taitung, and Guanyin factory in mainland China. If we can see that there is a distribution map here in Taiwan, the sales base in Taipei, Tainan, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, so we can see that we have a total of five production bases and six sales bases in both sides and sides.

In the past, the company's last experience was a negative of $2.5 billion, and the last experience was a negative of $2.5 billion, and the last experience was a negative of $2.5 billion, which is also a negative of $2.5 billion. The company's last experience is a negative of $2.5 billion, and the last experience is a negative of $2.5 billion, which is also a positive of $2.5 billion. The company's last experience is a negative of $2.5 billion, and the last one is a negative of $2.5 billion, which is also a negative of $2.5 billion.

This is the operating performance of 2024. Although the overall international downturn in 2024 is more favorable than last year, because in the second half of the year began to decline, it was gradually flooded by earthquakes and typhoons last year, there was a big earthquake in April and October, and there were two strong typhoons in October, and the impact of the US election, so the market consumption is more conservative. The combined revenue for the year is NT$207.7 billion, the gross profit is NT$15.4 billion, the gross profit is NT$15.4 billion, the gross profit is 7.4%, the net loss is 5.500 million, and the operating rate is negative 2.7%.

This year, we will also invest 3 billion new efficient biomass power generation facilities to significantly improve the efficiency of green power generation, and move forward towards the goal of self-pick-up and zero carbon emissions of green energy production. At the same time, we actively adjust the green product portfolio and obtain the third verification of the full-cycle evaluation of the product, and also in line with Taiwan's green procurement method, we have a complete FIC product line and expanded the product to obtain some environmental certification and carbon footprint mark. In 2025, we will continue to focus on the development of environmentally friendly products, promote the process of carbon reduction and environmental friendly, improve a green manufacturing system, and stabilize the sustainable operation and sustainable development.

The first thing I want to say is to continue to invest in green energy and green products is research and development or production. The first thing I want to say is that the cost of entering this green industry is compared to saying that these energy requirements are directly with the existing manufacturers to buy or use, which is the first question. The second question is whether there is no want to go to the factory overseas, because I want to see the annual report, some people may need to come in from abroad and then sell it to the original country or place.

What is the reason for this? Thanks. One question: green energy, what I do now is that my input fuel is my reproductive fuel, no increase, but my output is 2.5 times more. The entire equipment I invested in this time is to greatly improve the efficiency of the whole, that its output is 2.5 times that of the current, so this means more energy efficient and my utilization of resources will be higher.

We can do this by using the existing technology, the degree to which we can, whether on a fabric or a piece of paper, to replace some cloud-based plastic products, this direction has not changed. That will not go abroad to make other investments, in fact, we can look forward to the efficiency of this reproductive energy improvement case. If this is a success, then we will not rule out the possibility of copying such experience to some of the currently idle factories abroad. But the conditions are that there are local resources, whether it is wood chips or waste paper resources, we may have to invest in an overseas facility.

The two questions: the one about the company not phosphorus, the one that is not plastic phosphorus, you know what I mean is the first piece of product industry, right, today there is no mention of, help me to supplement this information. The second question about the company's raw materials, the Trump to pay for Canada's finance tax, of course, is not necessarily true, will there be some potential impact on our company's raw materials supply, whether it is wood, pulp, or not? The second question, complement one, no, first, this, good, thank you.

But the product is actually in place, just that the cost is relatively high compared to the original model, which is the problem, and continues to deal with that problem. The second problem is that Canada's problem, we are also looking forward to saying that if it really happens, and it lasts for a while, we do not know how long, that in March, at least in March, if it is to Canada, such as Ginger's tax, the tax rate is 25%, then it looks like Europe is going to supplement Canada's original supply to the U.S. market, so it seems that Europe's long label may appear to rise, and that Canada's long label may have the opportunity to go to Asia relatively cheap.

This is a good question. We observed that since the stock of the entire international bid is only falling down after the short fibers fell to the low in November last year, we believe that the low is in the shipment. It is a continuous increase to the fourth month of this month, because the mainland after the whole year of the opening rate does not look as good as expected, so this month's market has some resistance, on the international rise price has been announced this month another 20, long and short fiber, but the stock does not accept the current up and down, but the stock is not clear. But it now looks, the probability of the long fiber spread is more than 200 dollars, so long fiber spread is now up to 200 dollars, so if the short fiber spread is high, the price will go up and there will be a long spread.

This is the current situation. That month, if you say that the 20 pieces are accepted, the probability of going up one or two months later will be relatively large. Accepting the key in Shanghai, it is currently opening a conference called Jiangzi in the last three days, and until Thursday everyone will know a little more clearly.

Today we look at the first half of the year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the verbatim text from the user, and convert it from the verbatim format to the paragraph. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the structure.

First of all, I read through the whole transcription to understand the general structure and topic of the content. It looks like this section is about the uncertainty of market demand, involving tariffs, production barriers, regional allocations, supply changes, and future economic forecasts. The last part is about the open question and the end of the meeting. Next, I need to determine how to segment these sentences rationally.

I need to check the timestamp of each sentence to make sure that nothing is missing during the transition. At the same time, pay attention to the logical connection between the sentences to ensure that the paragraph transition is natural. For example, from discussing the current problem to predicting the future situation, to the process of the end of the meeting, such a structure is more reasonable.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the time range of each sentence corresponds correctly. For example, the timestamp of the last part of the question begins at 1096. 44, there is a skipped time period in the middle (1102. 44 to 1110. 44)), but it does not appear to be a missing sentence according to the content of the user, so it is arranged directly according to the order provided.

Now we have customers, because we don't know what the regional distribution will happen later, even if there is an order, their current manufacturing is a bit of a pause, which is a phenomenon. But for example, because the next quarter is the international river tax type, the forgetfulness of tax leave, not the manufacturing forgot, we have some items to talk about, so now there is a little more empty river. So the whole year will not be better, I believe that after two months is more clear, there will be a good deal, because this is a bit of a pause, but the continuity rate is how the second half of the year, I don't see it. If the overall economy, including Ukraine's rebuilding, the European military fee is a big increase, that is a basic investment, and that may be the most need to bring, but this one more months will be clearer. If we want to open the last question, we can ask your questions at this time, Chen Rui and the general manager will answer all the questions.
