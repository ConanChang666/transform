And then more capital than that. Our company is 49%. Or chai suspects that it is less risky than that. That RBC we have. Last year was 900. It seems like last year ended more than 900.

Then it turned into 720 by the end of the year. What significant is what our company has produced. Has the business changed. No. Just. The competent authority on the topic of RBC.

He made a lot of changes. He belongs to it. The magnitude of the natural disaster risk of the domestic partner business is magnified. So RBC dropped from 1000. From 900 to more than 700. I repeat it again.

This is not just a Taiwanese title. All insurance companies will be named. You will see. If you look at the RBC in the last year and the RBC at the end of the year, all insurance companies will have a gap here. No.

This is not a major change in our Taiwan production business or financial structure. It is a year of operation. Basically, the company is still on a growing track. Whether it is revenue or surplus.

There is only one growing track. And there is a new state in history. Well, let's look at our balance sheet. In fact, we see that our total assets are about 249 billion.

Our total assets have increased by 3 billion in the past 5 years. Our total assets have increased by 5 billion in the past 5 years. This is in several ways. The first is that our own profits are gradually growing.

Another thing is that we invest in financial environment for many years. Especially the stock market. We invest in a lot of money markets for years to come. The market value of our financial quality assets continues to rise in the years to come. The probability of this growth is relatively different from that of the past few years.

Well, our cash ratio is still high. Up to 37.78 billion. It's an increase of about 6 billion compared to last year. It's not that my investment is not positive. It's really too fast for money to come in. I still have a lot of money to spend.

And then we went up because the index was constantly climbing. We had some negative penalties on the shareholdings. That was in line with accounting standards. Most of my stock positions were in OCI. OCI meant that the benefit he said was not going to come to my profit statement. The benefit he was disposing of was not going to come to my profit statement.

I can take the benefit of my dispensation as a basis for the interest. That is, I do not consider anything. My interest can be higher than my profit. If I take the benefit of the profit on OCI, then we have some profit on this part.

It is also the basis of our dividends. The source of the dividends is not the basis. Our investors also see that our investments have grown from 136 billion two years ago to 163 billion.

Because earnings are market capitalization. A way to market price recognition. Well, that's what everyone sees on insurance contracts. From 2.2 billion to 2.9 billion on top of insurance contracts. This reflects the growth of our business.

I have a business income in insurance. I have a trade in insurance assets. That's not what I can do with my investment income. That's already listed. That's where my money has been handed over to the currency of insurance. The money's assets can't be used for investment.

It's almost like the concept of separation. Well, it's clear that we're growing our business. But it's clear. It's just growing from 2.2 billion to 2.9 billion when it comes to keeping our business. That echoes my past.

The last two years have been relatively significant in the growth of our business growth. Commercial reliance is very high. OK. That's right. It's a good idea to look at the guaranteed contract assets. It's a rough idea to see one of our company's business growth.

Well. That's insurance liability. Insurance liability is also a manifestation of business growth. We have about 92.81 million insurance liabilities about two years ago. It has reached 108.25 billion last year. It has also grown $2 billion.

The debt generated by my business has grown nearly 2 billion. Well, the growth of my business should be more than 2 billion. Well, our total debt is up to 126.37 billion. That share capital has not changed in our share capital.

36.22 million. Again, our share capital is the largest in the industry. Yes. I don't know why such a share capital is so big. So we compare to lose a little bit on EPS. So we have the profitability.

If our interest rate insurance business is not very high, or the return on investment is not very high. It is not likely to be smaller or smaller than other companies. But we are reflected on EPS. That is because we are larger share capital.

The EPS comparison will be a little more undervalued for our company. Well. That retention we have 8 billion. That's what we're looking at two years ago is 647.76 billion and now it's 81 billion. We have several parts. One is the health cloud and abundance that I'm going to mention every year.

There is another one that is especially prepared to accumulate. Because the business grows only to generate this cloud. So half of the money I make is left here. I have made money over the past few decades. Half of the money I have made is left here every year.

The other half is for everyone. That's it. Most of the other benefits are the premium of financial assets. That's all the financial assets I have now.

Similar concepts. For other types of program stocks. So I live in the whole right. Look at my rights. I was 9.45 to 11.11 billion last year. That's 1.2 billion this year.

Our shareholders' equity is growing at a rate of nearly 1 billion a year. Well, that's a lot more obvious. Two years ago there were only 27 net worth of US stocks. Well, that's good.

That was 30. 89 by the end of last year. It was 30. 89 by the end of last year. It was 33.88 billion by the end of last year. That is, my net worth has come to nearly 34 dollars. But we are all stock prices always below our net worth.

As long as the net worth goes up, the stock price will always go up. I think so. That's one of my balance sheets. A simple report.

So let's take a look at the real part of the table. Well. I just reported it. My billion dollar baby income reached 88.73 billion. It grew by 6.7% compared to the same period last year. The baby that was stuck in maturity was about 61.5 billion.

The difference between the two is that you can simply count on our debt income. All the revenues controlled by thousands of dollars. All the thousands of dollars to deduct the debt income. That's the treasure I left behind.

A similar concept.

This is how you can change the ratio of our debts. My net investment income, I first reported that our net investment last year was 7.7 billion, compared to last year's last year's 48.9 billion, which grew nearly 60%, just reported. We went back to this table and looked at all of my similar growth. Well, my interest income, my previous year's interest income, this interest income consists of two, one is deposit, and one is bond debt income. My previous year's debt income was $21.1 billion, and until last year's change to $26.6 billion, I grew 20, nearly 26%.

That's because I still buy bonds last year, so it is estimated that this year's amount will grow, because last year's bonds bought, some may only be half a year, or a few months of quarterly income, until this year it should be full year, a quarterly income, so this amount should continue to grow this year. The whole investment in water conservancy, I dare not guarantee that, for example, the stock price will not rise again, the exchange rate will not rise, but I dare not guarantee that this amount will continue to rise.

OCI's part of the evaluation of the rising non-net profit table, only in the increase in net value, but its distribution of dividends will enter the profit table. The previous year from the dividends only to zero to 1.2 billion, I last year in the dividends zero to 200 million, this two part, one is the stock of the listed cabinet companies we invest in, because of the growth of profits, its dividends have increased, and the other I through venture investment in this income, because I have invested in some stocks, which when the stock market is good, it has achieved a lot of benefits, so it is indirect, but still subject to the influence of the weighted index or the overall market, so I put it together.

That said, I need some maintenance fees, including tax Ah repairs, and there are about 30 million maintenance fees every year, so the net investment in rental income should be below 100 million, and it should be near 100 million. That last year was also a low rent, because last year there was a change in rent, so there were several properties I had to pay back a few months of rent, because there were changes in the rental industry. That said, the whole rent last year was full of rent, it was full of state, plus one of the properties I had made reserves, so there was probably a substantial increase in the real estate income, and it was also a significant increase in the last year.

As the stock market has also risen in the past year, but the bond has also risen, so there will be a loss of evaluation on the bond, last year there will be a loss of evaluation on the bond. Well, that's okay, from the few steps of this insurance and claims can be seen, my insurance business interests will decrease compared to last year, can you see? My performance has grown by 6.7 %, my compensation has increased by 9.3%, so my increase in the amount of compensation is more than my performance, it means that I will profit from the insurance business.

Here's a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. So if you go to match us with the premium income of the 6.7 to 4.3. So we still have some room for improvement in cost control. There are some room for improvement. That's a total tax return of 13. 79%, which grew by 17% compared to 11. 78% last year. Net profit grew by 18. 8%.

That's because last year's investment income grew a bit more, so we're a little lower. In the investment income, only rent and interest income are taxable. Capital gains are taxable against parity income. So as long as our investment income is higher, we'll be a little lower. In turn, if it's a relatively profitable investment in the industry, we'll be higher.

That's fixed. Our company's average tax rate for the year is about 15% if the long-term average is about 15 percent. Look at the current year's insurance business and the investment tax rate is about 15 percent.

This is why I have no net profit margin increase of nearly 4 billion yuan. This is not a net profit margin statement. This does not include the net profit margin that I have been dispensing. So you can see that my net investment income last year actually reached nearly 11.7 billion yuan. Net profit margin statement is only 7.700 yuan.

I have 400 million on top of OCI. Well, this one is 400 million. Then last year there were 62.28 billion. Last year there were 62.28 billion. So the two years add up my unrealized gains and losses increased by 1 billion.

"This is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me; do this in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me."

Our growth rate in the last few years is about 3 to 5 percent. It's not quite the same. There has been a big change in the past few years after taking advantage of market epidemic protection. Because we were the first to get rid of the epidemic protection. Although we were the first to do so, we couldn't.

Because we were first-timers, we got off early. So we had gamesd to a big market share in the last two years. From the market to the market to the market share, because our peers are still in our industry. That's because we want to grow up all over the country. So we quit early.

So we will grow in this performance will be a little more obvious. Until this year we are higher than the year of epidemic protection insurance. So I say that the creation rate of Qiandan baby is higher. That is, Qiandan baby this year than the year of epidemic protection insurance, our company increased 21 more premium income.

It's not a one-time income. We made up for this 21 performance income in 3 years. So there's no way to make up for the self-inflation premium. Self-inflicted premiums. Since the initial increase of 2 billion anti-epidemic insurance is mostly self-inflicted premiums. So this gap takes a while.

So you see. Our 2019 quandan baby performance is 6.2 billion. By the end of the year it was $88 billion. The self-timer premium was $4.7 billion in 2019 and now it is 61.5 billion. So the growth of this performance is really obvious.

But of course there are market factors. I don't dare to say that this company is like this. I believe that most insurance companies have such a growth trend and a trajectory. Just in the first two years, this situation will be a bit steeper than before.

And the whole industry is indeed a rising trend. Take a look at the performance of our surplus. Like last year, we made a record high, no matter what we did before tax. Well, 2021 is the new record high. Then the year of our insurance business is almost no money.

Every year, 4 to 5 billion insurance businesses are thrown back. That's all we do every year, but we still make money by investing in them. We don't need to sell our products or support our parent company like other industries that are new in the history of epidemic prevention. We don't.

We have invested money to make money. This is also the year of 2022. Many authorized companies in 2022 can't stand it. Because of the double share tax, our company is just one of our company's OCI evaluations we face a lot of losses and we face some losses.

This is where we make money. That is when I make a profit on the table and I can cover the loss of this evaluation outside the table. So we make a profit. So we still make a profit on the table. So there are still more than 30 million combined losses. But I remember that this year our evaluation loss is close to 600 million.

The rate is back again. Last year I went up again 400 million. That is the rate I want to tell you is that our company now has a profit figure that follows a few years ago is another step. There is our insurance business also has our investment ratio. This is not the same day. Then we invested only 400 million in 2023, but I still have a surplus of nearly 1 billion after tax.

That year, our insurance business made a lot of money. Because there was no natural disaster and no harmless insurance business made money. Then the year investment was bad and a little balance. Then last year the insurance business was affected.

That's what they often say about our win-win situation. We also have a concept like this. However, this profit after two years of tax before tax has been a step up. Well, a comprehensive review is to add the tax economy to the OCI price benefit I just said. This is a comprehensive review.

At the bottom of that review table, there is this number. Well, that's what we want to say here is whether our company's ability to bear or fight against the volatility of financial markets is really good. This is a company that can make money when faced with the epidemic situation of the industry.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a clear segmentation point. For example, when the speaker moves from one topic to another, it may be necessary to segment. For example, the previous sentences discussed are the stability of the company when faced with financial market fluctuations, the type of business and market share, and then the change in the proportion of insurance coverage, which may need to be divided into different paragraphs. Next, I need to ensure that the sentence logic in each paragraph is coherent, and time stamps may help identify the rhythm and pause of the conversation. For example, timestamps show that some parts may belong to the same topic, such as about the decline in insurance and the growth of business insurance should be combined.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete or require contextual understanding, but can't be modified. During the process, I will examine them one by one to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the portion of the blessing insurance involves multiple timestamps and explanations that need to be segmented correctly to maintain logic.

In addition, technical terms such as "Lost House", "Market Share", etc. may need to be kept as it is, but the user does not request an explanation of the term, so keep it directly. Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph-by-word text to make sure that all sentences are correctly arranged, with no omissions or errors, and that all the user's requirements are met. Make sure the format is correct, without using any Markdown, using only plain text, and there is a proper line separator between each paragraph.

This is a natural disaster, I can imagine, this is a fluctuation in the financial markets, so if there is no pain, our company's numbers will be more beautiful. This is a performance part of Dingyu. Well, let's see what our business is doing. By 2022, our coverage is also up to 54% of the market share. Most of the industry's car insurance companies are close to half, and even some are close to 60% or 70%, which should be the kind of industry's insurance companies with a background of Thai or new kind of car dealers, whose proportion will be higher.

However, some of the findings are that in recent years, the proportion of our car insurance goes down the road, this is not our car insurance performance decline, which is mainly the growth of the business model. As you can see, the first commercial insurance from the original 11% to the last year has reached 15%, this is when I just said the rate of increase, the market share increase, and the responsibility to breed from 11% to 15.3%, which is the growth of the business model.

This is why we have some advantage over our company, so we strive for the government bank's blessing of the industry, because general financial control will not point customers to other financial control people, because general financial control will not point customers to other financial control people, such as he must adjust it may be right. This type of insurance is actually only to make money, this is your home if you insurance, because you are affected by typhoon or earthquake fengshui, this insurance can help you, this is the policy support, is that if you have a loan, the bank will call you to keep the loan or he does not loan, so he has some policy support effect, there is a good level of policy, so this is always a must be a profit of our company. The company is a business partner and responsible for this must look a little heaven, because there is no big tree widow home, this is a big one, see you again how much you left yourself, so these two types of insurance is better than the first of your loss car, what kind of keys are you going to do for some potential high risk, you have no different ability, you are to undertake some relatively high risk business, that this year is the biggest is TSMC, every time as long as there is a earthquake TSMC, TSMC shut down, TSMC shut down all the assets of the company, he will not lose, the success of the company we want to lose, there is no electricity, so we don't have a lot of electricity, every time you listen to the news tell us, there are no problems with our friends, we've got a lot of money, and we don't know about the future, we're not only a lot of the next year, we will not a lot of growth, we will not only a lot of the next next year, we will be more than the company. cover is not enough, you can not pull it out too much, so the accuracy of this car insurance is really on the rise, which is also a steady increase in the company's profitability, business insurance should always say that you can think about it.

In the past five years, we have had a typhoon and earthquake. Especially in the past five years, there was no wind in the car, so Chen Hin-ye actually ate through the sky, and those years were really good, because of the exchange rate in the past few years did not rise.

There is no wind in the Taiwan wind. It is likely that the iron will be turned on. The exchange rate is up for two years, and then there is no pain, and then there is no wind, so the insurance performance of the year is not good.

Last year, there was one. It had a big impact. But it was not heartbreaking. Our glass insurance preferential value decreased. It decreased by about 10%. There was no such thing as a soaring glass.

Natural disasters can be tolerated. The three typhoons last year were relatively high frequency. There was another earthquake. Earthquakes had a big impact. Earthquakes had little impact.

Households have little impact. Households cover up to 1.5 million. I only pay you 1.5 million in full. Households have a larger impact. Commercial risks I just talked about. Factory includes BI.

Or an earthquake will tell you. The bullion mill has stopped. This is a distribution in our business line. Our company this year. We will focus on the growth of our personal business.

This includes car insurance. Households are more difficult. Households are already saturated. And we face a lot of competition in the industry. That we may put a little bit of risk in the car. I will push a lot of policy to come.

Or use a promotion method to make your car insurance grow again. Because business insurance is something. In fact, it is based on market demonstrations. We have recently been very easy. Our currency growth. I also want to be in the car insurance with personal insurance.

Because of the past two years. The proportion of our business insurance has increased. Previously our company's business insurance personal insurance. About 28. Until last year it has become 6535.

This ratio is not bad. It looks like every company's insurance type. We think that commercial insurance types are relatively high in both growth. We want individual insurance types to grow the same. Let's keep our company's two feet more stable. Good.

"This is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

This is our insurance business profitability rate. For example. If I have a policy with a hundred premiums. That's 53 for claims. That's 35 for the costs of the HairCount that I keep running.

That's why I can earn 11 pieces of this policy. Simple concept. Stay-at-a-glance is the interest rate on my insurance business. Or I'll make a claim. Or I'll take my company's HairCount. And that's the cost of all operations.

And then I'm less inconvenient to the industry. Our company's overall retention rate over the past few years. It's not in the industry. It's the interest rate on our insurance business. It's always in front of the rankings. So I just wanted to talk to you.

It is said that we have the idea that we are organized in risk control. That more than 100 do not make money. Why more than 100.

Not only is it lower than before. 86 80 to this place. It is not easy to lower each party. You lose control. You also have to control your expenses. Otherwise, this atmosphere.

So here we go. We see you. It's like this. It's a downward trend. It's the profitability of our company that's always rising. Because we're always on the rise.

"This is the work of the righteous, the work of the wicked, the work of the wicked, the work of the righteous, the work of the righteous, the work of the righteous, the work of the righteous."

The insurance business benefits will come out. Last year was not a good year. Last year was really a success, but only to return to the previous year.

I didn't jump to 90. No. We still hold it here. So the loss rate you see. This loss rate also jumps from 50% to 53%. My loss rate increases by 3%.

But the cost rate is still going down. There are companies that are controlling the cost. It is still increasing. So my loss rate is on the rise. But it is not large. It is crashing or out of control.

That's why this year, I can't say much, because I want to see a lot of things, but it continues to be profitable for the insurance business of the property.

"This is a good thing," he said, "and this is what we are looking for.

As you can see, my cash position has always been relatively high. This is the characteristic of the money company. Because I came from forced reduction.

I am regulated to only put in the bank door. Because it is dedicated. I can't use it. I can only put in the bank door to earn interest. The cash ratio of each company has.

This company's cash is a crime. Because it has a 4% interest to back. So it cannot be put too heavy on cash. **Please note:** The provided text appears to be a transcript of a speech, possibly a financial report or presentation, discussing insurance business performance and investment strategy.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-phrase transcript: [2790. 28-2792. 28] But because of the symbol of the law, we are a little higher in the proportion of cash. [2794. 28-2795. 28] Well, do you see the biggest difference between these two years? [2796. 28-2800. 28] I am constantly expanding my company from 4.5% to 9. 7% to 13. 97% last year. [2802. 283-2803. 28] 7% [2804-2806. 28] I briefly tell you what these are buying? [2806-2810. 28] I am talking about, because these two years have been risky with a large number of U.S. company bonds.

[2810. 28-2815. 28] The interest rate was 3.8 to 3. 75, and we thought it was very rare to find such interest rates in terms of the environment of Taiwan Dollar. [2815. 28-2820. 28] So we spent a lot of small parts of the company in the implementation of these. [2820. 28-2823. 28] The number of U.S. bonds for these insured companies. [2823. 28-2824. 28] The number of U.S. bonds for these insured companies. [2826. 28-2828. 28]

[2828. 28-2830. 28] The number of U.S. debts. [2830. 28-2831. 28] You can consider if you buy one. [2831. 28-2832. 28] If you buy a U.S. dollar. [2832. 28-2834. 28] You can buy more than 5% more than 6%, that's not a problem. [2834. 28-2830. 28] You can take the risk out of it and it's not as good as this debt. [2837. 28-2840. 28] It's a Taiwan dollar debt, it's not an issue of avoidance.

[2840. 28-2841. 28] It has no evasion problem. [2841. 28-2843. 28] It has no evasion problem. [2843. 28-2846. 28] It has no evasion problem. [2846. 28-2850. 28] The current bank deposit large interest rate is 1. 6 1. 7, so I put it. [2850. 28-2851. 28] If I can take the present present. [2851. 28-2853. 28] If I can move my deposited cash down to this place.

[2853. 28-2857. 28] I can produce close to 2%. [2857. 28-2860. 28] Square. [2860. 28-2861. 28] This part should be bought. [2861. 28-2867. 28] I don't know. [2867. 28-2868. 28] We bought a lot. [2868. 28-2869. 28] It was about 1 billion.

[2869. 28-2872. 28] It is more than cash. [2877. 28-2873. 28] Approximate yearly income of near interest may be generated. [2873. 28-2875. 28] Approximate increase of more than 20 million. [2875. 28-2877. 28] Look at the parts I bought. [2877. 28-2878. 28] I am here. [2878. 28-2879. 28] You see.

[2879. 28-2881. 28] I came from. [2881. 28-2882. 28] The blue part is the fixed income part. [2882. 28-2885. 28] You will find. [2885. 28-2886. 28] My fixed income ratio is getting bigger and bigger. [2886. 28-2888. 28] Or go back to what I said before. [2888. 28-2890. 28] I hope our company's investment income.

[2890. 28-2893. 28] is derived from the recurrent proportion of income. [2893. 28-2894. 28] can grow. [2894. 28-2898. 28] This can be seen from the allocation of assets. [2898. 28-2901. 28] I did not know much about that in the past few years. [2901. 28-2903. 28] Because there are no more suitable products in Taiwan. [2903. 28-2907. 28] So I have invested overseas for years.

[2907. 28-2910. 28] In the past two years, I should not stay in Taiwan. [2910. 28-2914. 28] Our company will not have any pressure to buy these bonds. [2914. 28-2915. 28] Why? [2915. 28-2916. 28] Because we are our company. [2916. 28-2918. 28] I just said that we are Standalone. [2918. 28-2920. 28] We have no control with major financial institutions.

[2920. 28-2923. 28] So I bought their bonds and bought a new one. [2923. 28-2925. 28] There were no miscellaneous household registrations. [2925. 28-2926. 28] I didn't have any control over them. [2926. 28-2929. 28] We didn't have any control over them. [292928. 28-2929. 28] So buying this debt is just right for us to invest.

[2933. 28-2937. 28] So this is the largest proportion of corporate bonds. [2937. 28-2938. 28] The financial bonds are relatively low. [2938. 28-2940. 28] Government bonds are probably more than 1%. [2942. 28-2947. 28] 10 years is a five-year government bond is more than 1%. [2947. 28-2949. 28] Financial bonds are a little more than 2%.

[2949. 28-2950. 28] That's what I'm thinking now. [2950. 28-2952. 28] This can be close to 4%. [2952. 28-2955. 28] This is mainly taken into account. [2955. 28-2960. 28] These are these. [2960. 28-2963. 28] Inspections are generally 10 to 15 years. [2963. 28-2965. 28] I go between 10 and 15 years.

[2965. 28-2968. 28] This kind of interest income has been pulled from me. [2968. 28-2971. 28] This is probably the concept. [2971. 28-2972. 28] I am not all about investing in repurchases. [2972. 28-2973. 28] Rest assured that I am still dispersed. [2973. 28-2975. 28] Because every inspection company came out to raise funds. [2975. 28-2978. 28] I am dispersed.

[2988. 28-2990. 28] It seems as if every household is being tested. [2980. 28-2986. 28] Cathay Fubon Sales Sales Sales Sales Nanshan New Sale. [2986. 28-2988. 28] Every household is coming. [2988. 28-2990. 28] We still have some dispersed. [2990. 28-2992. 28] Because we are in control of our company. [2992. 28-2995. 28] There is always control over the group's limitations.

[2995. 28-2997. 28] For example, I would like to buy Cathay Group. [2997. 28-3000. 28] The stock exchange bond cannot exceed me. [3000. 28-3001. 28] The direct percentage can be used. [3001. 28-3002. 28] This we have set out. [3002. 28-3003. 28] This we have set out. [3003. 28-3006. 28] We hope that the risk can be compared.

[3006. 28-3007. 28] Stronger. [3007. 28-3008. 28] This is a calculation of the use of capital in our population. [3008. 28-3011. 28] This is a configuration of the use of capital in our population. [3011. 28-3012. 28] Good. [3012. 28-3014. 28] Let's take a look at our free capital ratio. [3014. 28-3016. 28] You can see our net worth.

[3016. 28-3019. 28] From the 19th year of 89 billion. [3019. 28-3022. 28] All the way up to 120 last year. [3022. 28-3024. 28] For the past six years, [3024. 28-3026. 28] Our net value has increased by 20 points. [3026. 28-3028. 28] Half of our profits are our own. [3028. 28-3029. 28] We increase our own profit.

[3029. 28-3031. 28] The other half depends on the market. [3031. 28-3032. 28] The other half is ours. [3032. 28-3035. 28] Our financial assets benefit. [3035. 28-3037. 28] Overall, there is also an increase in the evaluation benefit. [3037. 28-3041. 28] So I am not only a rapid increase in assets. [3041. 28-3043. 28] My net worth is also increasing very quickly.

[3043. 28-3045. 28] So I. [3045. 28-3047. 28] My free capital ratio has not changed. [3047. 28-3049. 28] There is no great fluctuation. [3049. 28-3051. 28] This. [3051. 28-3053. 28] This should be true. [3053. 28-3055. 28] I should be inside the national insurance company.

[3055. 28-3057. 28] The family with the highest free capital ratio. [3057. 28-3059. 28] Close to half. [3059. 28-3063. 28] This is our free capital ratio. [3063. 28-3065. 28] About horizontal. [3065. 28-3067. 28] Another one is ours. [3067. 28-3069. 28] This is my most frequently quoted RBC.

[3069. 28-3073. 28] Our company is also the highest in the national RBC. [3073. 28-3076. 28] That time it was back to 1000. [3076. 28-3079. 28] Let's introduce it again. [3079. 28-3082. 28] This fall to 681 is the impact of real estate. [3082. 28-3084. 28] Real estate 1000. [3084. 28-3085. 28] We also jumped to 1000 pieces.

[3085. 28-3087. 28] also jumps to 1000. [3087. 28-3088. 28] That 746. [3088. 28-3089. 28] This is what we just said. [3089. 28-3091. 28] Debt is too expensive. [3091. 28] I don't want to buy that expensive. [3093. 28-3095. 28] So I bought a small amount of my debt.

[3095. 28-3097. 28] It was sent. [3097. 28-3099. 28] Then my own venture capital would become larger. [3099. 28-3101. 28] would deduct my RBC. [3101. 28-3105. 28] This fall is irrelevant to that. [3105. 28-3106. 28] It is irrelevant to business choices. [3106. 28-3109. 28] It is the standard for government posting RBC.

[3109. 28-3110. 28] Even so. [3110. 28-3112. 28] I believe that our RBC is in the industry. [3112. 28-3114. 28] should be one of the first. [3114. 28-3116. 28] I just said that our free capital ratio is high. [3119. 28-3112. 28] Our capital is the largest.

[3122. 28-3124. 28] Then it is not reduced. [3124. 28-3127. 28] Free capital is relatively high. [3127. 28-3131. 28] Cash is not much for you. [3129. 28-3131. 28] After that, my assets are clean. [3131. 28-3136. 28] It is not placed in a very high-risk investment asset. [3136. 28-3143. 28] All of this is within my RBC calculation.

[3147. 28-3148. 28] OK. [3148. 28-3151. 28] Okay, here is my report.
