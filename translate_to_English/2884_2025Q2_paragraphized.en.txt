We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you. We are looking forward to hearing from you.

First of all, in the face of the global economy, a sharp decline in international trade activities and expected tariffs, IMF maintains a global economic growth rate of 3% in 2025, and in the second half, it still needs to pay attention to the changes in trade policies and the impact of stock adjustments. The Fed's attitude is cautious, and it expects to start a rate cut in September. When it returned to Taiwan, Taiwan was subject to early shipment, and the exporter in the first half of the year, which led to nearly 8% growth in Q2 GDP, only to pay special attention to the impact on the outlook after tariffs.

In terms of operational performance, the balance of deposits and balances of deposits reached 2.4 trillion, grew by 9.1%, and corporate loans grew by 12.6%. Among them, SME loans grew by 8.4%, personal loans by 6.9%, and total deposits by 7.9%. In the first half of the year, the transaction income of 141.9 billion yuan, the highest record for the same period, the wealth management accounted for 701.9 billion yuan, and it was also the highest in the same period. In terms of operational highlights, the Net Income (net profit) and earnings per share were successfully delivered in July this year, and the Net Income (net income) grew by more than 22.9%, while the Net Income (net income) grew by more than 22.9%.

On the left, we can see the structure of the net handling fee, which accounts for about 50% of the wealth management and 27.3% of the credit card business. On the right, we can see the long bar chart, the wealth management has double-digit growth, and the credit card business has a 5.6% growth. In terms of capital adequacy, both financial and bank capital remained stable, and the first type of capital ratio was 13.74%. Next, we can show the bank's financial profile, bank deposits have reached 3.4 trillion yuan, grew about 7.94% yuan, and the total amount of yuan is 2.4 trillion yuan and YOY growth rate is 9.14 percent.

In the case of wealth management fee structure, bank insurance accounted for 44% of the total investment funds, 35.6% of the total investment funds, bonds and other 15% of the custodian trust 5.4%. In the case of bank insurance compared with the same period last year, the increase in insurance ratio can help Yushan to have a steady income stream in the face of market fluctuations. In the case of credit card business, effective card market share of 13.1%, a total of 529 million cards, the cumulative transaction amount of which benefited from the tax season's excellent years, accumulating a total of $39.9 billion in July, and the amount of card spending and handling income continued to grow steadily.

In terms of cost efficiency, CI Ratio is 46.9%. In 2025, H1 securities were contracted by market trading volume, affecting net profit after tax. In that regard, when the annualized RE 19.3%, it was the first stage in the domestic financial holdings. Baode Xinxin continued to launch innovative products, issued two ETFs, and opened the first batch of TESA-level funds in July.

First, the profit of Yushan Financial Holdings from January to July is 202.1 billion yuan, 202.1 billion yuan, then EPS is 1.25, which is 30. 9% compared to the same period last year, about half a year, that is 30. 9% in the same period in 2022.

The first time everyone was concerned about the transactional income, then I would say that in addition to the huge growth of transactional income, the other interest income in foreign currencies grew in order to grow, which is a more significant growth. That growth rate is quite high, about 50%. The second time we expect our income is also not ideal because we want the financial management of the second season of the financial market, but we still maintain the financial management of the overall growth of 11%.

In the first half of this year, we did not grow well in the case of food, the income of our fund insurance needs to grow well, that growth rate is maintained. From 23 years of growth 35% to 24 years of growth of 23 years of growth of 35%, then 23 years of growth of 25%, that last year in 24 years of growth of 18%, which in January to July, our insurance procedures will grow 30%.

That's when I first introduced our supervisors in the front row before our Q&A, and on the left is our Chief Accounting Officer, K.K. Chih-hong, and I think we all recognize him. On the left is our Chief Risk Officer, K.Y. Tse, and on the right is our Chief Financial Officer, K.C. Chen. There are two subsidiaries today.

We believe that the second half of the year should be more stable. We feel that in the case of the easing of funds, the need to maintain the deposit costs of the Taiwanese dollar should be OK. In the second half of the year, we predict that there may be two interest rates in the second quarter.

That's why in the second quarter or even the first half of the year, we've added quite a lot of fixed bonds to the interest rate curve. This is why we've added a lot of fixed bonds in the second quarter or even the first half of the year when interest rates are high.

Then we will continue with this strategy, because we believe that the second half of the year if we assume that it is a Q4 interest rate cut, it will be useful for our entire business promotion. So another dynamic will come from our investment in the US dollar, and I would like to do this first. Thank you. In the next part, we will also have another explanation. Before I explain it, I ask the executive director of the Bible to explain what this tariff is about the belief in our industry.

The following is the explanation. Our statistics show that the results of Trump's peer tariffs can actually be divided into two parts, one that is likely to deduct a basic tariff on each country, and that should be between 10% and 20%. The other is in the process of his opinion, and he wants to ask you to open the market or increase the amount of investment in the United States, or purchase.

If we look at the 20% tariffs, we see that Taiwan's exports to the United States are divided into two major areas, one is shipping or electronic, that is, information and communications related industries. That in this part of the shipping industry, if we say that the exports to the United States are relatively high, that is, the Taiwan shipping exports to the United States is relatively high, and we seem to be relatively high in several industries. This is a relatively high proportion of Taiwan's exports to the United States, but these industries have several characteristics.

So we look at the impact of the traditional industry, and we think the overall business operation is relatively good. The performance of the entire asset quality is not a big problem. In this part of the information and communications, we may look at the future, i.e. 232 terms, because Trump also said that the recent release of this piece. We believe that the electronic components or chips, in fact, Taiwan directly sells the U.S., less than 5%, mostly in the information and communications industry, are relatively similar.

So, in comparison to the ability to marry, there is probably one of these big companies in North America, so they can still stretch their risk, so it seems as if we are at the moment, the situation is OK. The tariffs on this industry, we see the impact of the traditional industry, we think the overall business operation is relatively good, and the performance of the overall asset quality is not a big problem. In this part of the information and communications, we may look at the future, that is, 232 terms, because Mr. Trump also said that the recent announcement of this piece is about the impact of the traditional industry, we think the overall business operation is relatively good. There is no big problem with the performance of the entire asset quality.

The object of the talk refers to the manufacturing industry, the export of the manufacturing industry, and then the sales of the United States. In the export manufacturing industry, the sales of more than 30% of the U.S., excluding information and communications, electronic parts of this project. That is electronic, now we talk about only the traditional industry, the manufacturing industry has sales of the U.S., that export of more than 30% of those industries, we are Yushan, our overall exposure of about 29,2,2,2,2,40 percent of the credit, when the credit is guaranteed.

Finally, if we add all the credit amount, that's 582 million. That's where the proportion of the total amount of credit is 4.9%; if it's the total amount of the entire Yushan, the total amount is only 2.4%. That's where the credit balance was just said, which is included in both good faith and common faith, all of which are included in it. We believe that the highest possible problem will not exceed 10%; the amount of the number is.

Since this is based on different credit equality, there are different results. So let's start with a simple report.

<think> OK, I need to deal with this user request now, and rewrite the verbatim-cutting transcription into paragraph-cut transcription without deleting anything. First, I want to read the material provided by the user carefully to ensure that I understand the content corresponding to each time period. The user emphasizes that it cannot be deleted or rewritten, so it must be strictly arranged in the original order. Next, I need to check each timestamp and the corresponding statement to see if there is a duplicate or need to be merged. For example, some sentences may be logically consecutive, but are separated by timestamps, which need to be merged into a paragraph. For example, a few timestamps at the beginning:

[1419. 18-1420. 66] It is difficult to estimate it. [1422. 10-1422. 98] It is always the same. [1423. 94-1424. 58] If. These three sentences appear to be continuous, they should be merged into a paragraph.

It may be necessary to add a link to the middle, but the user requests not to write, so only the original words can not add their own content. Then continue to deal with the following sentences, such as the impact of exports to U.S. companies and then to the official layoffs section, which should be a paragraph. After that, the portion of the debt quality is also a paragraph.

In addition, be aware that some sentences may be wrongly cut, such as "that for this peer tariff" followed by "as we just said", which may belong to the same paragraph. It is necessary to confirm whether the relationship between these words is in the same thinking, and then merge. Also check whether there are duplicate sentences, such as "we believe this situation will take a while" and "should take a while" mentioned later, but the user clearly states that it can not be deleted, so even if it is necessary to keep repeating. The process may encounter some convergence problems between sentences, such as the interval between timestamps, but the original speech may be continuous.

After completing the initial draft, read it again, check whether the paragraph is correct, there is no wrong word, to ensure that the user's requirements are met. </think> It is difficult to estimate. It is always, if the export to the United States companies are affected, which ultimately affects the quality of our official field or layoffs, it is also difficult to estimate. So we are talking about a direct impact, he is probably the case.

The second is to have the ability to adjust the U.S. company, which will be compared to us in the year we came to see, when our Taiwan industry has been nearly to the mainland of China, nearly 5 to 10 years ago. It is a phenomenon that is even uprooted, that the root up is a lot of traditional industries, to the mainland of China recently, in that R&D is very important R&D, including design ah planning, this most important thing was that we Taiwanese people, most not in the past. About 5 to 10 years they will slowly go to the mainland, to the mainland will never come back, and there is no way back. This is the worst year after 2010, many industries will happen, because no one in Taiwan, they are the people of the mainland.

But now we have to say that there are also companies such as the server manufacturer who moved to Taiwan, but he developed in Taiwan. 18 years after 2018, they moved back to Taiwan after 20 years, these R&D personnel are still in Taiwan. We believe that some of these servers will move to the United States, but we all know that people like this in the United States are not going to land in Mexico, so the impact of Taiwan should not be so quick.

The second is after a long time, because now the tariffs are different in each country, and the conditions of opening up the United States will be different. What is more important is that each country's exchange rate product value is different, and each country's competitiveness is different. So this situation should take some time, for example, the next year or the end of the year will be more clear, and the more clear the manufacturer will have a wave of migrations.

This is the same as last year, when we moved to Vietnam from mainland China, it was very clear, but this situation is more complex. This migration is not something we can control. Yushan Bank in Taiwan in the mainland of the South East Asia layout is very complete, including our LA branch in the United States, and our LA branch in Yushan has been open for 25 years. We are currently modifying it, and we hope to welcome this wave of opportunities from Taiwan to the United States.

We believe that the situation should be a little more optimistic, and that the opportunity will continue to grow, which is what we think. The second is what we just said by the Chief Financial Officer, NIME, because the entire U.S. money and interest rates, as well as Taiwan's money and interest rates, and exchange rates have changed a lot in the second quarter. Our opinion is that the SWAP market has ended, and that the market has been hot for years, because its specifications have become smaller and smaller.

The third is something we just asked about credit cost. Our credit cost was good in the first half, just like you have reported. Our Yushan credit and credit are making a big adjustment, so their credit costs are slightly higher than normal. But in the first half of the year, we have very little money in the first half of the three overseas fields, and his special deposit in the first half of January to July, and his three areas are just less than 200 million.

The increase in credit is normal for us, and the current view is within control. Just to say that the press conference is just a press conference, and the media has reported a case. Yushan took a case called Sanguang, the media reported that the amount is slightly larger.

This is a very serious matter, but in finance, he has enough. In fact, as long as he gets his first electric license, he is now in power and will generate cash flow. In fact, this ring door washing has been possible, he just said to them that we did not think they would do this much for the impact of environmental damage. We also think that this is our own jade mountain has no complete place to supervise. But this company's bosses are all here, and I believe that he will recover well.

[1827. 62-1831. 30] Then he put the device he already put in. [1831. 70-1832. 38] Make it good. [1832. 66-1834. 38] In fact, he wants to return the principal. [1834. 90-1836. 42] That is also within the range. [1836. 54-1838. 50] But still what he does.

[1840. 10-1841. 98] I would like to give you a special explanation. [1842. 54-1844. 14] I would like to ask a question. [1845. 22-1847. 18] I just wanted to ask a question. [1857. 18-1859. 78] I am a Fuhua Investment simple three questions. [1859. 82-1860. 86] The first one is just.

[1861. 42-1864. 94] The company's performance is really good. [1865. 46-1868. 02] Some relatively high growth rates include foreign currency loans. [1868. 06-1869. 58] Growth 18 or so. [1870. 14-1871. 98] The handling fee insurance. [1872. 02-1874. 70] The handling fee income of bank insurance is also growing very quickly. [1875. 10-1877. 02] These factors look good.

[1877. 06-1877. 42] However. [1877. 90-1879. 94] The company further details the truth. [1879. 94-1882. 14] What efforts were made in the environment? [1882. 14-1883. 18] The results generated by [1883. 42-1885. 06] then this thing happened. [1885. 46-1887. 50] will not continue this first issue.

[1887. 90-1890. 14] The second question is because the AI is hot right now. [1890. 18-1892. 78] Of course the banking and financial industry is mainly talking about how to go about it. [1892. 78-1894. 22] Apply this AI to us. [1894. 70-1897. 38] Cost or operational efficiency improve us in this respect. [1898. 30-1901. 10] There is no plan or we may use AI in the future. [1901-1902. 26]

[1902. 74-1905. 98] That third is of course the important factor in buying budget money. [1905. 98-908. 54] is one of the factors for long-term stability of the dividend. [1908. 78-1911. 46] This is something we encourage for long-term dividend policies. [1911. 46-1912. 58] We have nothing to do with the policy. [1913. 06-1915. 06] long term ideas like this. [1915. 06-1918. 38] I ask them to explain that they understand more deeply than I do.

[1918. 98-1919. 42] Yes. [1920. 46-1922. 42] A few include that. [1922. 94-1924. 58] Snowy Manly. [1925. 30-1925. 62] Yes. [1926. 34-1927. 58] Foreign currency exchange. [1928. 58-1928. 66] The one.

[1929. 38-1930. 98] Three delegates to explain. [1932. 66-1935. 86] Hello everyone, I would like to first explain how the AI can be used to reduce the cost. [1935. 86-1937. 10] Some of the explanations are made. [1937. 30-1939. 98] In fact, our internals are widely used. [1939. 98-1940. 66] This AI. [1941. 18-194.2. 26] This AI.

[1942. 62-1945. 50] That is, our internals are quite extensive in the use of AI. [1945. 50-1947. 66] contains it in the internal process. [1947. 86-1951. 14] Or, for example, we can have a lot of things like opening an account. [1951. 14-1951. 74] Or, [1952. 14-1955. 02] The first part of the credentialing process is actually now. [1955. 02-1957. 34] Implementing a multi-AI process check.

[1957. 58-1960. 22] One decrease in the cost of doing some manpower above. [1960. 46-963. 30] The other part we also use AI in various projects. [1963. 30-196. 10] Looks like. [1964. 58-1967. 06] Recently we launched some AIs like marketing. [1967. 34-1968. 30] The dam part. [1968. 58-971. 34] It also wants to be implemented through some of this diversity.

[1971. 34-1972. 30] Can be combined. [1972. 70-1974. 66] One man can do some improvement. [1974. 66-1975. 74] Then can use the man. [1976. 10-1979. 14] More customers need to be served above the supplement. [1983. 06-1985. 10] In the foreign currency part of the deposit is actually. [1985. 34-1987. 22] One important thing is the trend.

[1987. 22-1988. 02] Because of the whole. [1988. 18-1990. 70] Because it should be divided between the domestic and overseas two pieces. [1990. 70-1991. 58] The domestic language. [1991. 82-1993. 10] In fact, the first half of the whole. [1994. 38-1996. 42] The tariff issues do a lot of that. [1996. 54-1997. 42] Pre-shipment.

[1997. 42-2000. 38] So there are some related needs for trade finance in this section. [2000. 58-2003. 22] Then some overseas parts of Finland have. [2003. 22-2005. 22] Some of their own local. [2005. 58-2006. 82] A development of some business. [2006. 82-2007. 10] Then. [2007. 70-2011. 34] For example, such as infrastructure or green energy related.

[2011. 66-2013. 10] or related to the data center. [2013. 10-2015. 42] This is actually on the trend of the current industry. [2015. 42-2018. 06] So there will be a better kinetic energy for a business. [2018. 06-2018. 98] is promoted. [2019. 18-2020. 10] The above reply. [2024. 90-206. 34] The constitution has just mentioned the future insurance.

[2026. 66-2029. 30] Some of the dynamics of insurance business that just started with the general manager. [2029. 30-2030. 02] mentions the past. [2030. 46-2033. 46] Yushan's insurance business has been from the past three years and four years. [2033. 46-2035. 74] actually continues to make a steady growth. [2035. 74-036. 54] The direction of business development is in line with ours. [2036. 82-2038. 90]

[2038. 90-2040. 06] We hope to be able to compare some of the products with resilience in the face of some markets. [2040. 58-2045. 50] We can also continue some development when comparing fluctuations. [2046. 02-2047. 62] We probably did a few things. [2047. 62-2049. 42] We were the first to deal with some changes in the market environment. [2049. 42-2050. 78]

[2050. 78-2052. 90] For example, at the beginning of the year. [2052. 90-2055. 42] may be the time when the dollar is relatively strong. [2055. 42-2058. 22] We focus on some of the insurance products in Taiwan. [2058. 22-2060. 26] Or do something according to the market environment. [2060. 90-2062. 22] Some of the products that are more suitable are directly recommended. [2062. 22-2065. 42] The second we are some of our colleagues in the long run.

[2065. 66-2068. 14] Some of the consulting capabilities of this insurance are continuing to be enhanced. [2068. 14-2069. 50] is included as we are now. [2069. 82-2072. 18] is also continuing to develop some consulting on some of our insurance. [2072. 18-2073. 50] is also building such a team. [2073. 50-2076. 26] So we are a relatively long-term part of the insurance business. [2076. 26-2077. 34] Some development of the strategy.

[2077. 62-2079. 02] It's like when the market is more volatile this year. [2079. 02-2080. 22] I think it's that one. [2080. 38-2081. 94] The effect will be a little clearer. [2081. 94-2083. 74] That's what the future is all about. [2083. 74-2087. 30] It's something that we've been working on for a long time. [2087. 50-2089. 06] I believe we'll have some solid growth.

[2098. 06-2089. 66] Above thank you. [2091. 22-2093. 50] Thank you for asking. [2093. 50-2095. 66] We have our foreign currency reserve. [2095. 66-2100. 02] Yushan has 33 locations in more than 10 countries overseas. [2100. 46-2103. 50] The foreign currency reserve means that we are outside the country. [2103. 50-2105. 86] means the success of our overseas operations.

[2105. 86-2107. 22] is also very important. [2107. 70-2110. 50] We are overseas in a very healthy growth. [2110. 50-2113. 94] is an overseas deposit. [2114. 54-2117. 58] The bulldozer is probably a loan. [2118. 46-2121. 50] The overseas ROA is higher than the domestic ROA. [2121. 98-2123. 42] This is our overseas business.

[2123. 42-2125. 02] I would like to know more about Yushan. [2125. 22-2127. 62] I know Yushan's so-called layout in the third decade. [2127. 62-2130. 18] Asia's overseas development strategy. [2130. 58-2132. 58] So we are still working on it. [2132. 70-2135. 42] And the most important thing in recent years. [2135. 42-2136. 70]

[2136. 90-2139. 70] Then they were able to bring their results. [2139. 70-2141. 58] The results of the layout were inspired. [2141. 58-2143. 02] was reflected on the financial statements above. [2143. 38-2144. 78] So for foreign currencies, this part is made available. [2144. 78-2146. 50] We will continue our efforts. [2146. 66-2148. 10] This is very important to us.

[2148. 58-2150. 90] That should not be all in Taiwan. [2151. 22-2152. 78] It should be all overseas. [2152. 98-2153. 70] It should be good overseas. [2153. 70-2154. 90] The country will do good. [2155. 14-2157. 18] Because the difficulty of overseas is much higher than that of the country. [2157. 46-2159.] I think it is an important thing for Yushan.

[2159. 78-2161. 38] That was just explained by our colleagues. [2161. 38-2163. 62] Insurance for this business. [2163. 98-2166. 90] There are no insurance companies inside the Yushan Financial Holding. [2167. 18-2169. 66] The insurance we sell is for other companies. [2170. 02-2171. 14] Similar to us. [2171. 14-2173. 54] It is Nanshan Life KGI Life, etc.

[2173. 86-2176. 14] Some insurance industry. [2176. 30-2177. 86] Leading companies in the insurance industry. [2178. 06-2181. 46] They are unlikely to sell good insurance products to Yushan. [2182. 02-2185. 50] They may have their own policies or strategies within them. [2186. 02-2188. 22] The insurance we sell is not necessarily good. [2188. 94-2191. 30]

[2191. 30-2193. 86] Our Yushan is more difficult to get this good condition. [2194. 38-2196. 50] But develop insurance. [2196. 50-2199. 74] Then let us be insured and all other financial business. [2199. 74-2201. 54] The ability to develop a balanced development is our policy. [2201. 66-2202. 98] It is a very important policy for us. [2203. 78-2205. 14] I have just started.

[2205. 26-2207. 26] This we have carried out for 22 years to the present. [2207. 26-2209. 70] 22 23 24 25 This year is the fourth year.



And then there's the customer side, with this kind of view, we have the ability to collect the part, and then add the exchange rate fluctuations, and then back to the trader's hands, so I think the whole machine operation is just fine. The question is, I think that we now have the ability to grasp this opportunity, we have the ability to grasp, so we have a transactional income, I think will gradually be a healthy and stable. The second half of the year we just mentioned, is that because the U.S. wants to lower interest rates in the second half of the year, so we will lower interest rates in the second half of the year, so we are really good at selling the commodity. Then again, after this tariff, a hedge demand for a currency, in fact, so we think it is better than the next year, that we will be more than that.

I would like to ask the head of the accounting office to explain it, so let's ask the general manager of Paulson, that representative of the letter to say a word. So the answer analyst just mentioned that we did in the past storage structure, just as mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer, we have been raised from 33 all the way to 36, in addition to understanding the impact of clearing the deposit and TWD this appreciation, then we are also working hard for this dollar's deposit structure and the amount of deposit between the dollar than the structure is trying to make some adjustments, including the increase of the exchange rate from this currency, of course, because it is about twice as much as the average interest rate, so this part of the regulation of our spoil is really significant help, if from the deposit here we should have 2 to more than this, so we will continue in the direction of this direction of the future.

The third is that we have already joined the budget monitoring, but we still have a good close cooperation with the United States of America of Baodexin, that future development, in addition to we can continue, we can act as a budget monitoring bridge to overseas, we can not only connect some of the advantages of the financial group that may have been in the past Baodexin, and even some of the other three parties in the future, some of these some of the good capabilities of management, we can bring it inside the control through the investment role, I think it is we can play in three different directions of the future, thank you. Well, I'm going to do a supplement again. The first is tariffs, tariffs after tariffs, tariffs, and then the impact on the end needs of that society, it should be divided into two places.

So we see that in 2022 in Europe, the United States, Europe, especially the United Kingdom, Europe, or Japan, and Korea, the final impact of inflation is very big, the first situation will get worse, the second is even bad even the ruling party will go down, that inflation is a general phenomenon. But if the commodity prices are rising, it is an individual phenomenon, it will produce an alternative effect, which is not so big, and it is only once. So if the impact of tariffs on Taiwan's mid-market demand, that is, that our confidence in Taiwan's climate, that is quite complex, that includes other aspects, including our political stability, etc., will be more complex.

First, I need to confirm the specific requirements of the user: do not delete, rewrite or condensate anything, keep the original words intact, just reorder the sentences that are broken down into paragraphs. The user may want this finishing text to be easier to read, suitable for reporting or meeting records, may need to refer directly to the original text, so the structure is clear. Next, I need to carefully read the provided [Script Fragments], identify the beginning and end of each sentence, and ensure that the sequence of sentences are arranged in chronological order during the reorganization, and combine the relevant sentences into paragraphs based on logic and subject.

First of all, I will check the integrity of each sentence one by one. For example, sentences in the original manuscript may have some time code breakpoints, but the actual sentences are continuous. For example, "that's not so good for the American landscape" to "even if the negative outlook happens," may need to be merged into the same paragraph. However, according to the requirements of the user, it is not possible to rewrite or merge sentences, so it is necessary to keep the independent sentences corresponding to each time code unchanged, just to segment them rationally.

Each topic may be discussed by a different speaker, or the same person continues to elaborate, so paragraphs need to be appropriately divided. It should also be noted that the part of the Q&A session, such as the question and answer of the audience, should be separated by the appropriate line of exchange. For example, the question and answer of the audience should be separated as separate paragraphs, but the phrase in the verb may be separated by part of the answer, and I need to confirm whether the order is correct.

At the same time, pay attention to the correct spelling of the terminology, such as the "IRP Act", "CT-1", etc., to ensure accuracy. During the conversion process, also check if there are missing sentences or wrong timecodes. For example, some parts of the text of the user's transcription may have obvious segmentation, such as "[3350. 50-3351. 50] The above simple description Thank you", may be the end of the answer, followed by a new question, need to change the segmentation. Finally, the whole check whether the converted paragraphs are smooth, whether they conform to the format of the meeting record or the report, and strictly adhere to the requirements of the user, without adding anything, only structural adjustments. To ensure that all sentences are preserved in the original order and correctly segmented to form an easily readable paragraph.

That wasn't so good for the US. But now it's only a few. Because it was included in March and April. President Trump thought that his practice would make the United States unthinkable. Our view was that even if it were unthinkable.

It is not a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is not a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is not a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time; it is a matter of time.

This seems to be effective. That is, everyone's opinion about his policy. It determines us. For his market outlook. The second is that part of LIM.

Just explained a lot. But we will emphasize one thing. It's a big change. The second season starts to change very big. That's going to take us to the fourth. We do trading.

We benefited from last November's law. We also believe that we can see. The US policy has changed. It has made this a straight-click curve. It may turn into a positive evil rate. That may be for this year's business.

Especially in the trading market. Especially in the investment business made a major change. It really started this year. The straight-click rate curve began to normalize from March. Normalization began to become positive. Later, the positive rate of evil became more and more obvious.

More and more obvious. That's what we think of this year's fee. If the second half of the year's fee decreases. By the next year's rate decreases. A short-term interest rate decline does not mean long-term interest rates. Be sure to follow it down.

However, there may be a decrease in short-term interest rates. Greater than the decrease in long-term interest rates. Therefore, the positive rate of this straight-to-click curve is more obvious. In this case, the investment business can be expected.

Investment business is. This is another performance of another type of loan. So this is also a change in this curve. Affecting banks also affect the risk, especially the insurance companies will have a greater impact. That is for our commercial banks.

We have to seize this opportunity. Because commercial banks only have one year of capital costs. Evaluation highs are only six months. So we adjust the cost of our capital. The speed of our adjustments is very fast.

But we are the same as the investment object. The interest rate of the investment bought is the same. So the two industries are very large. The market changes. The commercial bank that.

The direct impact is more direct. He reacts immediately. Now the insurance company reacts in the book. This is probably because we think it's more clear. And the original five.

I think it's going to be a bad idea. The five dots are different. But the budget is always what we think. That's two yard numbers. Now it's going to be three yard numbers. We're a little bit smaller now.

But we think the positive slope of the straight curve should be a little steeper. This is about our investment. Just speaking of trading. Trading is about the environment.

If the value is depreciated like a new currency. Life is so big. Everyone expects it to be big. That is, the multi-factor is bigger. This volatility is bigger. Starts widen.

This is the time when we will be able to do this, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it, and we will be able to do it.

We also expanded our Hong Kong scale. That Hong Kong was just right. It took place in two months. The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars fluctuates as well as the magnitude of the change. This is our contribution to the trade.

It's all good. The above is a simple explanation. Please ask again. Do you have any questions?

This is the second year in a row. The clear receipt of the relevant debts is significantly reduced. The company still maintains a view of receipts all year round. It is a double-digit increase in the previous two-digit increase.

The first half of the first quarter of that year's operating expenses control. That's okay. That's the growth of regional revenue. The second half of that year's operating expenses will still be controlled throughout the year. About 9 to 10%.

This level will be lower. That third is. After applying the IRP law. Probably. IRP will add the City benefit about how much. Mr. Feng said first.

About IRP. Mr. Feng That's because of that IRP law. There's still a period of trial bullets. Then I think our third bank is also allowed to test it.

And then I think that's because we're going to go with that whole one. Our RWA. It's a small size of our new asset. It's not necessarily a fluke. So it's probably CT-1 here.

Adds 2 to 3%. But I think I just mentioned it. That is to say, we will follow one of the structures inside our structure. A different one will make some changes.

In addition, it is because the market was in July. A standard law of risk is also applicable to that market risk. Standard law applies if it is the bank itself. In fact, the RWA of B-products is higher. So this thing is actually floating.

That is to say, I would like to say if IRP. The competent authority is willing to work for him because he actually has. 72% of this flow is in fact, so the competent authority is also very tight. So I want to pay attention to our family. If possible, it is very important to pay attention to our family.

Thank you for the simple explanation above. Well, it's good to explain a part of the operating fee. We are currently expecting the operating fee for the whole year. We will still want to control below 10%. Because we can see that we were born at the end of June.

The economic growth rate after tax is 31.9%. That is higher than the economic growth rate after tax is 19.3%. It is also higher. Operating costs have increased by 9.1%.

The cost of one compares to one number associated with the other.

In fact, I think this is to maintain a relatively healthy, a state and a growth in our business expenses. In fact, the most important part of the cost here is mainly included in the use of this place, and the salary of the employee is paid because there is a performance.

There is also an increase. The other is the portion of sales tax. Because our proceeds have grown. So according to the tax law, that sales tax will be the same. Than it is not the concept of sales tax It is the concept of total.

So this part will grow naturally as well. So in the current growth of this business tax we think. All are relatively reasonable and should be just below 10%.

Have you ever asked a question about wealth management? Then ask. Ask about the growth of our wealth management this year. We will do our best. Grow with a double-digit number to achieve our goals.

That's until the first half of this year, we're actually here. Just a little earlier, I mentioned that we grew by 12.9% in the first half of the year. Then I think we'll continue to do our best.

But after the end of the purchase a lot of mechanical equipment before and after. It costs a lot of money to go. We spent a lot of money to convert. The depreciation of the mechanical equipment takes 5 years. So we have spent some time in the past. The cost rate is relatively high.

It is relatively high. But because we have been strictly controlling this over the years. The expense of that information equipment and the expense of the project. So we have control over it in this respect. So we may be in control of the situation of that expense for the past two years. It is better.

If we are to pray, we are to pray, and if we are to pray, we are to pray, and if we are to pray, we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray, and we are to pray for three days.

It's done. That's why it's announced next year, so it's going to have a positive impact on the next year. The RWA is the first half of this year, and the RWA is the negative growth.

Because there is a new system, because there is a new system announced, so we have little to grow, although our business has grown, but the use of the RWA we enter is rather negative. This is a very rare phenomenon.

But like we said before, there is a new system to be implemented in July. This will increase us a lot of RWAs. Of course we are currently in the process of management. We hope to be able to control this RWA. Increase the efficiency of our capital use.

The better the use of capital, the more cash incentives that can be issued. I think you're probably asking this question, thank you. This is a brief explanation. It's a very complex process.

Please ask again. If not, there is. There is. There is. There is Michael from Citibank on the line. Then there is Michael, the manager.

I have a few questions here to ask. The first thing I would like to ask is to see the media say. The chairman said this year's Oratio. It may be 60 to 70%. It seems like it was earlier than the beginning of the year. The mid-to-long 80% is slightly lower.

So I asked, "Is this a good thing?" and "Is this a bad thing?" and "Is this a bad thing?" and "Is this a bad thing?" and "Is this a bad thing?"

That is to say, this is going to be 60 to 70% adjustment. Then the second thing I would like to ask is this. NI here, because from the end of last year until now, this is our fundraising cost. Improvement is very obvious.

This is especially the currency here. So I would like to ask you this. If we are Fed, we will continue to cut interest rates in the second half of the year. We funding cost here again. How much space is this optimization.

Because if we look at this, the listed interest rate. Maybe this is only two more points in the US dollar's time deposit. That's the cost of that deposit. That is, if this Fed comes from four points.

The third one asks for this. The credit card is here. It's a vision of the year. And so I'm going to ask again.

This is where trading can't give us one. Maybe this kind of breakdown will happen in the first half of the year. For example, this swap still has this flow. How much is the return, and how much is the mark to market.

"And I will call upon the name of the Lord, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him."

For corporate loans here. We won't see this second half of this corporate investment. It will increase. Then for the second half of this momentum. How do we see it.

Let's take a look back at the first half of the year. I replied to my credit card for the second half of the year. That's it. Look at the entire credit card market for the first half of the year.

Growth continues to come from mobile payments. Online transactions and physical transactions abroad. This is still the main source of growth. We look at the second half of this year. We look at the momentum of this growth in the second half of this year.

That Yushan looks at our own growth in the first half of the year. It is probably between 5 and 6%. If we grow by July, we grow by 7 percent. We expect that the whole year we are still on our side. The goal is two or more growth.

Or, if you are a beginner, you are a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, a beginner, and a beginner.

It should be said that everyone was in tariffs before. Investing in this piece was a little more conservative. We observed that these two months were actually mainly or in fact. Some large factories in North America are relatively close here.

[3814. 30-3815. 82] It's just another thing that we see, including investments in electronics and semiconductor-related industries, have been maintaining a stable investment. [3816. 34-3820. 18] The investment in electronics and semiconductor-related industries has been maintaining a stable investment. [3823. 74-3825. 30] The overall look at us, because in the first half of the year, one is the effect of pre-shipment vendors, and in the second half, we're relatively likely to want to see what the whole situation is like. [3835. 38-3838. 70]

[3840. 70-3841. 62] In the above description, Microsoft reported that this part of Trading Gain. [3849. 66-386. 30] Micro reported that this part of Trading Gain, when we report with you in the past, it is mainly in the FX SWAP this piece, the situation is different, because we are mainly in the case of FX SWAP, so we are in a different situation, because we are mainly in the case of FX SWAP. [3866. 34-3882. 58] Then our FLOW has some of these trading curves, because this year the market rate is actually from high, so we now SWAP with our re-bills accounted for almost half of this piece, but FLOW is still a very important piece of the relative growth to double level. [3890. 30-3895. 62] Well, I am going to share a lot of our money in this year.

[3948. 86-3950. 14] The last addition to the thank you, I would like to mention that the matching Oratio part, which we just talked about in 2023, is very important to us for commercial banks, because the speed of interest rates in that year is particularly high, more than 100% 101%. [3969. 10-3980. 62] If the 2024 part of the year is this year, then we share Oratio is also very high in the cash part, and that because of the increase in profits, it is just reported that if we continue to increase our profits in the second half of this year, we should also have a ratio, if other conditions can be controlled. [398. 94-4006. 78] That should be very important for us to say that it is very important for commercial banks, the first time. [4047]

[4059. 14-4063. 80] That's a struggle. [4071. 18-4078. 38] We're afraid of predicting errors, and the adjustment of this warning will turn into a disaster. [4080. 86-4083. 02] Let's ask a question. [4085. 34-4092. 10] The online friends have already finished the question, and our Yushan Financial Holding or our analysts have long supported Yushan Financial Holding. [4102. 26-40108. 50] Although the environment is changing, business operations are constantly facing the challenges of that environment. [4112. 98-4124. 70] We cultivate our talent and then cultivate our resilience in response to environmental changes, which I think it's important.

[4128. 98-4134. 30] We hope that you all analysts to support Yushan. If you have any questions, you can call us, our IR supervisors are here, and they will know that you will save everyone a response.
