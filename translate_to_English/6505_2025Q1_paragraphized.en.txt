<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it into a paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the rules of the user carefully to make sure that each step meets the requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept strictly.

For example, the first part of [30. 00-58. 00] mentions "today is mainly Prime Minister Li Keyan... ," followed by the content at various points in time. It should be noted that some sentences may have slight differences in timestamps, such as 533. 00 to 546. 00 is missing, but the original data provided by the user may be incomplete and needs to be processed according to the existing content. Next, I want to integrate these sentences into natural smooth paragraphs while maintaining the order and integrity of the original text. For example, in terms of revenue growth, it is necessary to align the results of each department to ensure that each data point and description are correctly arranged.

During the integration process, there may be times when timestamps are not continuous, such as jumping to 533. 00, when there is a need to check for omissions, but according to the data provided by the user, only these parts may exist. Also, note that some digital formats, such as "46,000 barrels" and "384,000 barrels", need to be maintained in a uniform format, but the user requests do not modify anything, so the original expression must be retained. It is also important to pay attention to the connection between sentences, for example, when explaining the changes in revenue, may involve multiple factors, the descriptions of these factors need to be integrated into the corresponding paragraphs to maintain the continuity of the information. At the same time, make sure that all numbers and percentages are accurate, because these data are important for financial reporting.

However, users do not need to remove timestamps, so it may be necessary to keep the timestamps as the beginning of each section, or hide them in the content, according to the user's actual needs, but the timestamps are not shown in the user's example, so it may be necessary to convert them to paragraph structure without displaying the timestamp. In summary, the steps include: 1. Arrange all sentences in the order of timestamps; 2. merge the adjacent timestamps into paragraphs; 3. ensure that all the original texts are deleted, maintain the original intention and structure; 4. Finally read the check for smoothness and accuracy.

We look at the distributions of Q&Q in the lower right-hand corner, with Fundry growing 20.9% in the refining business, or Orefin, which grew 12.8% in the refining business and 8.2% in the utility sector. For this reason, the refining department was mainly due to the increase in refining and sales.

In addition, since the oil price is also higher than last quarter, so the total price of the oil also follows the rise of the water, and about a barrel has increased the revenue of the refinery department has seen a significant increase. Well, Orefin this piece has also grown by 12.8%, mainly because of the increase in capacity utilization. Last year's fourth quarter of our capacity utilization was only 58%. But this year's fourth quarter was 53%, and this year's first quarter grew to 58%. The selling price is not much, but this year's new Taiwan dollar's currency value is relatively low, so the price is expected to increase.

The price of electricity in the supply area and the price of coal has been reduced by 8.2%. Compared with the first quarter last year, it was about 1.2%, with the chain oil sector falling by 1.3%. Although the output was slightly increased, it was that the first quarter of this year was slightly higher than the first quarter of the year, but due to the price difference in the chain, in other words, the price of the oil product decreased by 1.3%. The price of that well was a small decline, mainly because of the fact that our operating rate in the first quarter of last year was about 53%, and it increased to 50% this year.

The supply is growth, mainly because the first quarter of last year is relatively expensive, so electricity and steam prices are rising this year. The first quarter of this revenue, in this part of the business profit, this quarter is 373 million, compared with the quarter increase of 4 billion. That in the first quarter of this year is a profit, because the fourth quarter of this year is a loss, mainly not because of the oil system, the price difference is better, but because the oil price last year fell to a low, and then the first quarter of this year began to rise, and then gradually fell, so this year is said to say that the inventory cost started this year is very low.

In the first quarter of this year, the sales price was slightly increased, mainly at the beginning of the first quarter of this year, there should be some of the market economy on the mainland, so the price of the product in the west is rising. But this is not long, and even when we were in January, there was still a currency in the west, but this did not continue. The public part is that the amount of power is reduced, and the price of our steam and electricity is adjusted to the overall price.

In addition, the interest in some inventory evaluations this year is lower than the same period last year, as the value will be reduced. Compared to the same period last year, our January ratio increased by 16.4%. The oil refining this year, because it was only mentioned that at the end of 2024 when the oil price was low, but at the end of 2023 the oil price was very high. So even if this is the first quarter of 2024, its refining price difference is better, but because it has some interest in inventory in the first quarter of 2024, so the first quarter of this year is higher than the first quarter of last year.

So supply is also a slight increase in this capacity. The other is the part of the inventory evaluation, there is a decrease in interest, this is probably a decrease of about 5,600 million. Then see this after tax interest, this year's first quarter after tax profit is 3.7 trillion 8 million, the same as the first quarter of the year increased by 2.4 billion. Then, of course, with business benefits increased by 4 billion, but after tax only increased 4 billion.

So this year's tax return is lower than the first quarter of last year. Let's look at the chart on the left. The chart we see is the four lines in the middle that are pink, green, blue and orange.

That's about all of our revenues, and it's about 90% or more. That's why, of course, the most important of all, is the turquoise part. We've seen from the far left, the first quarter of last year, and in fact, it looks like this spread is good. That corresponds to the picture on the right, and it's almost the same as the price difference on the chain in Singapore. We've seen on the far left, and the first quarter, and it looks like it's high. The first quarter last year was mainly because the price difference on the diesel in winter was very good, including the aviation fuel that can't be pulled up.

However, since the first quarter of last year is actually warm winter, the demand for diesel should be relatively poor. But last year, because the European side was worried that the market would be lacking oil, so it said it would be very high waste. So winter, the oil price did not fall. But the demand for gasoline in the U.S. market was better because the warm winter, so in general, the whole chain price difference in the first quarter was good.

We saw that the line on the right was about to fall from the fourth. That's when the price spread on the quadrant of the quadrant went down almost seven dollars. In the case of the low price spread on the quadrant, there were times when the price was a little lower. This was probably the price on the way to the first quarter of this year. Only in the fourth quarter of last year, the performance relationship increased slightly, and the rest was really bad.

This is mainly diesel and red oil. In addition, the oil is not good. We see the blue line on the left. The whole year is not good. The main thing is that the petrochemical system is really bad. Because many of the petrochemical products can actually be mixed into the oil.

So, because the petrochemical industry is not good, these petrochemical companies send a large number of these components into the gas oil. Or, to go to the Singapore market, so that the gas oil is going to fire. In fact, summer should be better, and in fact, there is no better. This has been going on until the fourth quarter of last year, because there are some tax breaks in the autumn.

But this year, because it was the last winter, Europe was warm and winter, and the United States was cold. But the melody of the whole winter is still dominated by Europe. So the price is also followed, and then the first season is followed. So the poor price difference in the first quarter is also bad.

Until May, we began to go up to this whole poor price difference. We saw the last point, the last point is the situation of May. Of course, June and May remain the same. Why did the May start to change? There are probably several factors.

Of course, this is what we can also see: low oil prices are starting to increase. Especially in Europe or some parts of the region that are more sensitive to the price, such as the U.S. petrol market, or Southeast Asia.

Another reason, of course, is that in the previous year, everyone was overestimated to burn it. So the stock was very low this year. So after the second quarter of this year, I realized that the stock was not built all the time. Because of the low stock, I said that the price difference was higher.

Of course, there are other factors that remain very low exports like this China. This could be because it was about the time it was last year, as his consumption tax refund was lowered after that.

He probably has been keeping this figure for quite a while. That year was still going on. And we also observed that this U.S.-U.S.-U.S.-U.S.-U.S. official field started slowly this first quarter. So some of the U.S.-U.S.-U.S. stocks were not set up. So, of course, the war between Russia and Ukraine was intensified at that time.

And because Russia has long been under war, in fact, his chain volume, his chain production capacity is slowly going down. Because he does not have some support from the West, it is actually more difficult to repair or to recover. But the last thing is because this started in April, should be in May, the Middle East, because he began to increase production and increase crude oil. So he put the oil's weight down significantly, he probably dropped about a barrel or two three dollars.

That's it, it's the case in May, and so far it's pretty much the same. So our chain price difference in May jumped to 11 pieces7. It was about 67 pieces of money in the past, and it's pretty much a huge growth. Then 11 pieces of money in May, and it's about 11 pieces in June.

That's what we're most concerned about. Because of the fact that this tariff is going to be flipped on July 9th. Of course, I don't think it's going to be flipped all the time, but it's going to be done slowly. What's the impact of this in the end, and it won't affect the oil well's demand further. We're going to look at the picture below, which is the price difference between the West View product and the light oil.

This is probably between 200 and 250 pieces. The price is actually a bit higher than this. The problem is that we can't sell all our products at this price. So we can only accept admission at about 50 to 60% of the operating rate. So what is the price of our contract?

But the spot price is probably only about 200 pieces of light oil. This price we are going to produce in fact does not make money. So it can only maintain a low face. The two lines above are D2C, D2C because it is a relatively shallow market, so it says it will be more volatile.

But the interest it takes is very little, so the situation of profit or cup water for the whole of our western landscape is actually a bit small. This situation may also be a bit larger. The price we see now is D2C, because it is relatively shallow in the market, so it is more volatile. The price may last for a while. Let's take a look at what we look at while we are on the side of refining.

In 2025, we found that the world's production capacity of refining is actually reduced, but the demand is still growing, and the demand for 72 million barrels is expected to be quite conservative. Because, for example, OPEC is estimated to be much higher than this, but we think it is not suitable. That 26 year is probably also likely to increase the capacity of 5.5 million barrels, but the demand is still more than the capacity, so it seems that the whole battery price difference is not good.

So this first quarter of this year, because of the influence of the warm winter in Europe, coupled with some excess production last year, it is said that this year's first quarter to April, the electronic price is not good. But in the future, what we will see is that the oil price is falling, so there are many factors, because the oil price has many disadvantages.

These adverse factors include, for example, OPG plus, OPC plus, which is probably the part of voluntary production of 2.2 million barrels, probably the land will continue to resume production, this part will be completely restored in September this year, so the total capacity is much more. In addition to this, non-OPEC this year's increase in crude oil production is also a lot, and there are about 14.4 million barrels. So why is it so much more? Of course, it is because there are some big projects, like this in Welner, and in West Africa, some large business runs to start production this year, so it is expected that there will be more than that this year. Of course, there are about five million barrels in the forecast that the U.S. is expected to increase in production, but now it looks like the U.S.

In addition, of course, tariffs may affect the demand for the entire oil product, and this part is actually more variable. In addition, it is said that the oil on the mainland is still going on, the demand is still going down, mainly because it is the promotion of 1V1, so that the demand for gasoline is reduced. In addition, it is a lot of diesel slowly to natural gas, which also affects the demand for diesel. Of course, it has many new petrochemical plants, so the demand for raw materials for some petrochemical products is increased, so it is said that the demand for such as light oil or LPG is increased.

Of course, crude oil cannot fall very low, because it is a strategic material, after all, the global stock is low, because now it can say that no matter which region of the world, crude oil or finished oil, probably its stock is under the same period of 5 years. So, the oil price is some support. Of course, the risk of war is not completely eliminated, whether it is war war or war, there are some risks.

Of course, there are some benefits to the oil price, such as the global electrification of the car is actually its speed is slow, and there may be delays on the high point of the entire crude oil demand. Of course, I just mentioned that the liquid crystal dispersion of the United States will increase the production of 500 million barrels, but this I think should be less than right, so it can also reduce some pressure. This is the part of the oil price, we still think that the whole is a negative factor, so it will still go down the reverse.

In addition to the price difference, we believe that the price difference will slow down.

There are several important factors, one of which is the reduction of the expansion. You can see the table below.

We look at a few circles above. Like the United States in the next two years, 73000 barrels will be reduced. Of course, this year will reduce a little more.

Like Europe, 377000 barrels will also be reduced. In the upper right corner of Europe, 377000 barrels will be reduced. This field has been switched off in the first quarter of this year. Mainly in Germany and the UK.

For example, most of the U.S. is on the West Coast of the U.S., so it gives Asia a decent opportunity to sell to the West Bank of the United States. Europe, because of the right official field, it needs to be replenished from the Middle East and India. So India and the Middle East, so it is likely to decrease.

In addition, Japan has been reducing its volume. In fact, it is imported from the Korean door. This also reduces the Korean goods to the Singapore market sales. So this part is actually the whole supply and demand for the future.

In addition, it has just been mentioned that China's exports will decrease. Because of the relationship of duty, there is also India. That is sorry. That Russia's capacity also slows down. And then the capacity is also damaged.

So exports are also slowing down. Of course, there is another better factor. That is to say, some of the situation in the Honghai is a bit opposite. So this may be India and the Middle East. The monthly fee to the west can be reduced. This reduces the pressure on it to the east side.

It may be because it does not want to increase production. So we will reduce the added value of Middle East crude oil. This is, of course, good for spreads.

Of course, the oil price is low, just mentioned. There is some help for demand. Also, there are some small chain factories in China. It actually lasts a long time. Using some Iranian freight Russians. It may be increasingly difficult.

It is also helpful to the whole supply and demand. Of course, these are some of the more favorable factors. There are, of course, also the disadvantages. The main thing is that the product that was expanded in 2024 was not quite smooth at all.

So this year, we will continue to join again. In other words, China's internal needs have been really declining. This is not only a problem with its diesel fuels. This includes some of the things it needs in it. For example, its deflationary problems and real estate problems.

And, of course, one of the biggest variables is the trade war. What kind of situation is the trade war? What kind of impact it can have on demand.

In fact, there are many factors that are beneficial to the price difference. So we are still good to say that the future is that the future of these chain prices will be better than last year, and then to 26 years later, we also have a more positive view.

This is the story of a man who has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the dead; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living; he has lived in the land of the living.

That 2025 was 878 thousand tonnes. That 2020 was more than 9 million tonnes. That was probably all in Asia. That 2025 was all in Asia. That 2026 was about 77 million tonnes in Asia. That I wanted to grow in global demand.

A year is now about 500 to six million tons. So that's the gap in supply and demand. This gap in supply and demand is getting bigger and bigger. It will continue to grow. Of course, there are some things that are less competitive.

But basically. This is still a serious case of oversupply. Another is 2028. 2027 and 2028 we look at the data. Probably China is adding at least 5 million tonnes each year. 5 million tonnes.

Then add other stock markets. On average, there are about 10 million tonnes a year. So this part is actually, unless they have some big changes in their plans. Otherwise, it might look like this.

That is to look at the players in this market as a whole. Look at the exit situation. Because the demand for growth has to be explosive growth. In fact, the situation is not easy to happen now. Because the main reason is that the U.S.-China trade war is still fighting. So this demand is not very likely to be explosive growth.

Then the market in China is also very common. So its demand is also unlikely to increase very soon. There is also some stress on long-term global slowdowns. Reducing the pressure on the shape. This will also cause some obstacles to the growth of this demand. Of course, there is no advantage at all.

Like this U.S.-China trade war. Mainland China may increase the difficulty of obtaining some U.S. raw materials. For example, it is more difficult to obtain it with a bowl. So this part may be. Direct start rates in the list of bowls may be reduced.

That is to say, this is for us. We still have some favorable factors in Taiwan. For example, the United States is a timed export country. But some of it needs to be imported, because many of it is made of a bowl. So, like carbon, it really needs to be imported.

Because it has some trade geography between China and the United States, so this part we want to sell to the United States. Relatively speaking, there is relative to China or elsewhere. This is a good thing. Of course, there may be another help for this demand. That is because the oil price is low.

The cost of timing can then be slightly reduced. Usually, the product of this timing is a little slower than its response. It does not fully reflect the price of the oil. So this part may make these spreads of this timing industry a little better.

Even if it falls to 67. So it is difficult to grow substantially under this circumstance. So we think that this is a hard day to go. Look at the next page. This is our operating rate during the past time. Just as we mentioned in the first quarter, the operating rate of our intern police increased to 58%.

We expect the second quarter to be 58% as well. That's to take advantage of this first quarter although the operating rate is high is 85%. But the second quarter will be slightly lower. Mostly because we have some checks.

The plan is about 40 million, but it will actually exceed. It should be slightly higher than the plan's strength.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim text, convert it from a verbatim form to a paragraph, while not deleting any sentences. First, I have to read the user-provided example dialogue carefully to make sure the understanding is correct. The user emphasizes that the most important rule cannot delete or rewrite anything, so it must be very careful.

First of all, I will check the user-provided sample conversion. There are duplicate sentences in the original verb, such as four times in a row on the part of the "second quarter saw the impact of the third quarter", and the result that the user expects is to merge these duplicate sentences into the same paragraph. This may mean that these duplicates are an erroneous or recorded error in the original verb, but according to the user's request, everything must be kept.

It is important to note that the interval between timestamps and some sentences may be short and belong to the same paragraph of the same speaker, which should be merged. For example, [2065. 12-2068. 72] to [2080. 56-2083. 68] These sentences are related to tax breaks and the second quarter, and should be merged into a paragraph. The later sentences may start with new topics such as exchange rates and oil prices. When dealing with the duplicated "2nd to see the impact of the third quarter" section, the user may wish to merge these four sentences into a paragraph, although they are of the same or slightly different content.

In addition, be aware that some sentences may be interrupted over time, but need to be determined based on content consistency. For example, in the carbon cost issue, users may want to keep all the relevant sentences in the same paragraph, even if the interval is large. Finally, make sure that the converted paragraph type transcription is smooth, logically clear, and without missing any original sentences.

As the tax holidays are a little early, we are told that the data in our state will increase to 78%. That is why we say that in the second quarter, the second quarter is, of course, April. Due to the impact of these rates, and the impact of oil prices falling, of course, we are more difficult to operate. But there may be some high-price inventory in June, and there is no way to digest it completely. But we expect that by July, we should be able to slow down this operation, which is what we have to say thanks to you today.

So, for the second quarter, we see the impact of the third quarter, in fact, we see the impact of the third quarter. In fact, we see the impact of the third quarter, so the second quarter we see the overall market of the third quarter, in fact, it is still an opportunity to look at the election, because I am talking about the amount of 10,000 already, or the opportunity is ignorance. Then again, it is the part of the watch, because it is the need for policy, that this part of our watch, it is possible to further implement, or to allow us to give us a little impression on this.

In addition to this, of course, the oil now in Europe is very short, because a lot of oil from the Middle East, because there are some obstacles to the war, so it is said that like the chain price difference is really good, so we should be able to extend it, about July and August should be able to continue, July and August can continue, we will start to enter some so-called winter stocking period, and then start to enter this period, the period is about September and November. So we have to buy the third quarter of the fourth quarter of the chain price difference, in fact, it is more likely to compare the positive, but the oil price of the third quarter may be, we think, because the third season of the oil price should be 65 to 70, so we will not be able to make some inventory loss, but the fourth quarter is more difficult to predict, if the fourth quarter price is even if there is a price, but if we want to pay more than a lot of oil price, we can only a lot of oil price, we have a lot of oil price, we have a lot of oil price, we have a lot of oil price, we will be, we can buy a lot of oil, we will be a lot of oil price, we have to buy a lot of oil, we have to buy a lot of oil, if we will be, we can not to buy a lot of oil price, we have to buy a lot of oil, we can do it, we will not, we can do it, we have a lot of oil price, we will not, we can, we will not, we can, we will not, we can, we can, we have a lot of a lot of oil price, we have a lot of oil, we have a lot of oil, we can, we will not, we can, we can, we can do, we can do it, we have a lot of oil, we have a lot of oil, we have a lot of oil, we can, we can, we will not, we will not, we will not, we will not, we can do, we will not, we have to buy a lot of oil, we will not, we can, we will not, we can, we will not, we will not, we will not, we will not, we can, we will not, we will not, we will not, we will not
