<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like it is divided into several sections: appeal support at the beginning, financial data report, Q&A questions and answers. Each section has timestamps and corresponding text. Users want to combine these sequenced sentences into paragraphs, but maintain the integrity of each sentence. Next, I need to determine how to segment them. Usually, paragraph-based transcription will be segmented according to the subject or speaker.

For example, the initial appeal support part can be combined into a segment, the financial data part can be segmented by quarterly reports, and the Q&A part can be segmented by question and answer. However, the user does not explicitly specify the segmentation criteria, so it may be necessary to judge according to the content logic. It is important to note that some sentences that appear repeatedly, such as "Experts and Contacts with Dot Columns", may need to be retained as well as merged into paragraphs. At the same time, timestamps may not be displayed in the final paragraph script, but the user does not mention whether a retention timestamp is required, so it may be confirmed. However, according to the example provided by the user, it seems that timestamps are in the original data, but the final output may not be required, so it may need to remove the timestamps, only retain text content.

In addition, the example provided by the user, timestamps and text are separated by spaces, for example, "[0. 00-29. 98] Please feel free to like the forwards and forwards. During finishing, it is necessary to remove the timestamp, keep only the text part, and merge sentences of the same topic into paragraphs. Now, I need to process them one by one, merge the duplicate sentences and segment them according to content logic. For example, the initial appeal support section may have multiple duplicate sentences that can be merged into a paragraph.

Q&A section, each question and answer may need to be separated. During the process, it is necessary to make sure that no sentences are omitted and that the order is correct. At the same time, be aware of the coherence between sentences, you may need to adjust the punctuation or add a link, but the user's request does not change the content, so you can only keep the original sentence, and you may need to use an ellipsis or a link to keep it smooth. Finally, check for any omissions or errors to ensure that all sentences are properly merged, and the format meets the user's requirements.

A total of 106 billion. 60.9% of the revenue from the main business. 47 billion compared to the same period in 2024.

In addition, communications and consumer electronics. And other revenues are growing. But the overall revenue share. Because of the increase in server revenue, there is a slight decrease in the overall main business revenue.

76.9% growth over the same period in 2024. Mainly benefited from an increase in customer demand. Strong pull-outs. Next, we can see. Overall revenue changes quarterly. See Q1 us in 2025.

Heatsink module revenue share. Benefited from strong server demand. Quarterly revenue reached 137.89 billion. Compared to Q1 in 2024. 78.74 billion. 75% growth.

Other product categories have not changed much. Here you can see how our main business revenues have changed every quarter. You can see the changes in the first quarter of 2025.

Server revenue up to 106 million. Doubled over the same period in 2024. The rest of the network charge 3C and other changes significantly. It can be seen that the company's main revenue growth momentum remains the same.

The server is the main. The next section. The out-of-the-box payment section we can see. We are mainly in exchange for income and other. The exchange of income is mainly because.

The company's payouts are based on U.S. dollars and RMB. In the first quarter of 2025, the strength of U.S. dollars was strong.

The demand for water-cooled modules has increased. Therefore, customers have more disposable mold income. Basically, as long as the case grows, the rest of the income will grow. On the next page we see the balance sheet. The total assets in the first quarter of 2025 were 1118.25 billion.

of which part of the cash is 344.92 million. Total debt of 784.2 million. Equity of shareholders 33.53 million. Net worth of each share 74.32 yuan. Compared with the same period of 2024.

Compared to 2024. The increase in Q1 inventory in 2025 is mainly affected. Tariffs affect the customer's position in advance. Next, see the following portion of the financial ratio.

The liquidity ratio and the speed ratio decreased. The number of days the inventory cycle has increased. This is the reason for the increase in inventory. Next, we see a cash flow statement. We can see a significant increase in inflows due to operating cash. Free cash flow increased in Q1 2025.

The net cash flow of Q1 in 2025 amounted to a total of $43.4 billion. The net cash flow of Q1 in 2025 amounted to a total of $43.4 billion. It can be seen that the company's cash level is still within the safe range.

Hello, my report is here Thank you. Next to the Q&A section. Next to the Q&A time for feedback. Welcome to invest in advanced. You can write questions on the question form at hand.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

This is a question. Q2 2025. Outlook for year-round revenue behind 2025. And last year's revenue.

The product is ranked by the strength of this growth. That's the question I asked him. That's Bill's answer. This question is mainly about the problem. If there is no systematic risk, then this year's revenue is projected.

EPS is more than 50% higher than last year. Revenue in Q2 this year is expected to increase by 15 to 20% compared to Q1 this year. Q3 partly due to the conversion period of GB200 to GB300. And the reasons for tariffs and exchange rates.

Q4 is partly due to the traditional peak season. It is expected to grow compared to the Q3 revenues. The other product is weak. The company does not have the strength to statize the growth of individual components. Because we are shipping the entire module. That is expected to be the percentage of server revenue this year.

It will be more than 40% of the total revenue. The annual revenue of AI server will be at least doubled from last year's revenue.

"We're looking forward to seeing what we're doing," he said, "and we're looking forward to seeing what's going on in the fourth quarter.

We all have this business. They're all running. So I'm not proud of the fourth quarter. So later he said that the fourth quarter will grow more than the third quarter. So we're going to say that.

Otherwise, we're all relatively conservative. That's the second question. 2025 in the second half of the year. What is the visibility of easy cooling. 2025 This. The V200 GB200 ASIC.

The strength of the cold demand. That's what I call our business head. This Eric answered. We saw. The cold demand continues. The same way as a scale.

Whether it is DGX HGX. NGX ASIC. All of these programs are. So it will be cold. Thank you. The next question is.

GB300. Switch Train. Change is the design of Bianca. What is the impact on our AVC. Positive or negative. Change in unit price.

There is also a GB300 Switch Train. Coblet or water cooled design. What's changed. I asked this horse to answer. Well, that's fine.

GB300 is back to the Bianca architecture. We think Alignment is a very good opportunity to grow. The main reason is that we are the main supplier of GB200 cooling solutions.

And then this experience.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-based transcription:. Let's be our preferred partner under the Bianca architecture. As customers are more focused on the reliability of our modules and the integration of our systems, we have demonstrated our technology and delivery capabilities through our mass production at GB200. As for the GB300 Switch Tray, we are still in the process of mass production, so the design information related is temporarily inconvenient. Thank you.

There are a lot of problems, so we'll look at the next issue. The GB300 water cold is expected to have an impact on our ABC. Then I'll also ask Matthew to explain it to you. Well, just mentioned that because the GB300 is back to the Bianca architecture, we have already proven our technology and delivery capabilities here in Bianca. Our R&D team also believes that we can prepare for mass production at the beginning of the third quarter.

If the GB300 is delayed, we believe that customers will be able to meet their current computing needs and increase the purchase of the GB200Bianca architecture. That is also because we have a small advantage here at GB200, and we think that this is a good opportunity for us. Thank you Matthew. The fifth question is whether the whole water-cooled computing trade is a trend or the same as the GB200 is the mainstream.

In fact, we believe that the trend of computing trade in the future is to look at the overall cooling needs from the perspective of the problem. Instead of just talking about a single package solution, we want to look at the whole machine's heat dissipation solution. In fact, it is always close cooperation with customers, and then according to their system needs to provide them with a customized and optimal solution.

That's why we also believe that in the short term, the solution of air cooling and water cooling is a hybrid solution that should continue in the short term or the long term. But in the future, we have to think about how AI is going to evolve in the future. That's why Edge computing doesn't need to use such a hot chip or inference to handle it with a lower power consumption.

That long term look at how much our AVC share of public manfold in CSP or social water cooling has been estimated in the market share of the CDU. I will ask Matthew to answer. Thanks to Mr. Chai, I think that for our long-term market share, we should think about what our unique advantage is, our Qihong and our competitors. In fact, we believe that this Qihong will continue to play a leading role in the heat dissipation market, and then many of our competitors are actually the suppliers of a single heat dissipation component into the market.

This is why we are so confident that we have the technology to do all three very well. Then we think that this is the core competitive advantage we have accumulated for a long time. That is, when we see that CSP and servers develop the next generation of products, the solution of cooling is not a simple package but a key component that affects the overall system.

We are confident that we will continue to grow our market share as a key partner with CSP and ODM with the advantage of high-end thermal management and system integration. The other question is Sidecar certification and shipping progress. That will outsource the whole machine sidecar or a single Component shipping Sidecar parts.

In fact, it's kind of like Macon and Manifold tell us that we are constantly a manufacturer of integrated heat dissipation device objects. In a special project, we will work with our customers to do a system study. Their main shipment or parts so that we can make the system's customers in the middle of the ecosystem.

Ecosystem is relatively healthy, so the parts we are shipping now, including skills, fans, Pumps, Manifold, Racks, I can support them all. The whole machine, I have followed the customer study, with specific, special customers in Study. Thank you. The next question is, Oh, this, this, this, this, this, that there is investment, ask whether although there is any change in the design of the new GB300, content value, whether the competitive situation is more intense. uh, it is not complete, so the details are not easy to share.

Second, Content Value has increased, but different customers, it is different design, some public edition, some small changes, so the ratio is not good now. The competitive situation is more intense, at this point in time, we feel almost, no more intense. Right, then, we maintain a high share for us, we continue to be confident. Right, there is a similar problem, CSP customers, ASIC cold shipment progress, whether there is an increase, and ASIC cold shipment progress, is not one of our customers.

The second part of our shipping ratio, or GPU, is more CPU, but we see a difference in the second half of next year. Next year, we began to talk about custom ASIC water cooling, shipping ratio and quantity, and then there were investors who asked us about 2025 2026's point of view planning and updating, which we are also doing. What we can share is that, as we said in our last March, our CFO said, we will now have a total of 4 buildings in Vietnam, we will build 5, so the final plan is in the middle of 2027, we will cover all 9, and the production of Fully Capacity.

In terms of the manufacturing process, two points are similar to one at a glance, and the difference is mainly from the control of the system level, and the stability of the management, which is the current technical difficulty. The Varum Rubin part is still in the design, so it is not easy to reveal. Thank you. The planning of the mobile VC, our heat dissipation is not due to the mass production of a large number of circuits, which we ask the business here to answer. Erik.

We believe that tariffs will have an impact on any business, but we want to emphasize that Qihong is a high-quality, and product-scale heat dissipation vendor, which has always been an important partner for our customers, and even if future tariff policies have been adjusted, the company can respond as quickly as possible and continue to provide the highest quality whole machine heat dissipation solution to our customers. In the distribution of tariff costs, under the existing tariff structure, there are exemptions for electronics shipments, and the 90-day exemption period, so the direct impact on the company is uncertain.

It is not so easy to find a manufacturer with a lot of experience and good quality. If there is a significant impact on subsequent shipments, the company's sound financial scale is also able to bear the greater risk. The part of the early shipment, the company has been full of capacity since Q1, so we think the total order volume will continue to rise. Thank you, the answer is that there is no product plan outside of China Vietnam, so we ask Bill also to answer. Well, that's not the current company in other countries' expansion plan, but if our main customers ask us, then the up and downstream manufacturers are also set up locally, and there is enough capacity, we will cooperate with customers to set up factories, including the United States.

This is because the gross interest rate calculation is relatively complex, so we do not have a specific assessment of the impact of gross interest rate. However, because the company's collection is mainly in the US and RMB, payments are also in the US and RMB, so there is a natural avoidance effect on the earnings. However, if there is a natural avoidance effect in the long-term, then we will have a cash effect, our cash payment is in the US and RMB.

In addition, we will discuss the relevant quotations with our customers, and we will discuss the relevant quotations with our customers. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I added this question, because of this Foreign Currency, the impact of this foreign exchange, compared to our company, from the previous Taiwan Dollar appreciation to 275, to later depreciation to more than 33 points, our earnings, if you see last year, the US Dollar is strong, our annual exchange rate is also 300 million, last year, so in fact, we can imagine that Taiwan Dollar appreciation is very small, only with each report, this is because we have to follow up, our business colleagues are to follow, the goods quotation, you are to the problem of the recently mentioned Gross Margin. So, outside of Nature Hedge, the company in this regard, the exchange rate fluctuation of our earnings, we can say, very small.

So, don't object, we have to find the next time you talk, you just look, okay, it's necessary to know, I'm going to start the season, that Krieg, we've heard that one day, gusti. As for the first one is GB300, the visibility can be more visible, or the second is ASIC water cold, maybe we'll start shipping, or other other new product layout, like the CDU class, this is what will be shipped, because this year's fourth quarter theory, may be with the traditional seasonality, not so relevant, but feel the confidence of the fourth quarter will be very high, so I think, I'm easy to ask, Nomura Securities N, Nomura Securities N, Nomura N, Nomura Securities N, Nomura Securities N, Nomura N, Nomura Securities N, the first, if there is not a system risk, right.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcript:. [2008. 18-2011. 56] The following is the second one you speak first. [2011. 56-2011. 74] True. [2011. 74-2012. 98] Second. [2012. 98-2016. 30] Why the so-called fourth quarter is a traditional thing. [2016. 30-2017. 02] Why.

[2017. 02-2018. 92] The first one is so-called. [2018. 92-2020. 38] Right. [2020. 82-2022. 10] The one is not said. [2022.-10-204. 38] That is. [2024. 38-026. 96] In [2026. 96-028. 50] That is.

[2028. 50-2030. 30] may buy more. [2030. 30-2032. 86] then save more. [2032. 86-2034. 38] To save more cases. [2034. 38-2036. 70] Usually occurs in the fourth quarter. [2036. 70-2030. 22] The first quarter. [2038. 22-041. 04] He saves the natural dynamic.

[2041. 04-2045. 40] The third was mentioned just before. [2045. 40-2046. 16] A lot. [2046. 16-2047. 18] Case. [2047. 18-2049. 24] He was in the transition process. [2049. 24-2050. 78] Next generation. [2050. 82-2053. 38] His config changed.

[2053. 38-2056. 20] So content value went up. [2056. 20-2057. 74] Then. [2057. 74-2059. 52] There are many new cases. [2059. 52-2060. 54] Adjustment. [2060. 54-2064. 90] Our company provides so-called 1AVC. [2064. 90-2067. 98] So product portfolio more.

[2067. 98-2070. 02] It all adds up. [2070. 02-2072. 06] Let us feel. [2072. 06-2074. 62] If there is no systematic risk. [2074. 62-2077. 18] This year the fourth quarter should be. [2077. 18-2078. 46] The third quarter is coming. [2078. 46-2080. 52] We do not know that we have a complete answer to your question.

[2080. 52-2081. 28] Thank you. [2093. 32-2096. 40] Thanks for answering that very well. [2096. 40-210. 26] But I would like to ask if the fourth quarter is pretty much the same. [210. 26-2103. 04] ASIC's new cases will be mass production. [210. 26-2103. 40] The new cases that include multiple customers may begin mass production. [210. 40-2110. 48] This confidence we have just mentioned is not.

[2110. 48-2111. 50] There is also a relationship. [2111. 50-2114. 84] Not only ASIC. [2114. 84-2115. 60] Yes. [2115. 60-2117. 40] Our company products. [2117. 40-2119. 70] General portfolio. [2119. 70-2120. 72] Not only service.

[2120. 72-2122. 00] Not only ASIC. [2122. 00-2125. 08] There are a lot of things in mass production. [2125. 08-2126. 10] So the whole. [2126. 10-2129. 94] You imagine that 1AVC has a lot to mass production by the end of the year. [2129. 94-2130. 44] So, [2130. 44-2131. 72] As long as not.

[2131. 72-2134. 80] Special situations will be better theoretically. [2134. 80-2135. 82] OK. [2135. 82-2139. 40] Please check if we have a certain amount of GB300 expected? [2139. 40-2140. 44] OK Ask if we have a certain amount of GB300 expected? [2140. 48-2142. 02] OK Ask if we have a certain amount of GB300 expected? [2142. 02-2143. 04]

[2143. 04-2146. 12] This particular case is not convenient for us. [2146. 12-2147. 14] Good thank you. [2170. 48-2190. 44] Good thank you. [2190. 44-2192. 76] Good thank you. [2192. 76-2195. 56] Ulan. [2195. 56-2196. 84] P soda.

[2196. 84-2198. 38] P soda. [2198. 38-2199. 40] G foster. [2199. 40-2200. 44] G study. [2200. 44-2200. 46] General work filters. [2200. 46-2204. 86] There are some records you have asked. [2204. 86-2206. 22] A lot of that.

[2206. 22-2209. 14] Sorry, this is a lot of problems. [2230. 46-2259. 44] Thank you. [2260. 46-2281. 62] Very interesting stage so. [2281. 62-2286. 32] It seems that we don't have such a limit right now. [2286. 32-2287. 30] Right. [2287. 30-2290. 12] We are now in design.

[2290. 12-2290. 46] [2290. 46-2293. 78] Is the day should be ultra only to see. [2293. 78-2296. 54] This is the design of 2028. [2296. 54-2298. 28] It is a bit early for the present. [2303. 96-2305. 46] Not as you mentioned it first. [2305. 46-2307. 18]

[2307. 18-2307. 98] That. [2307. 98-2310. 38] There is no feeling of electronic. [2310. 38-2310. 92] The second. [2313. 62-2315. 88] We ourselves as Macy said. [2315. 88-2317. 32] As the boss said. [2317. 32-2320. 42] We are the industry that integrates three institutions.

[2320. 46-2322. 86] We give ourselves a challenge. [2322. 86-2325. 42] Give us our goals and do one thing. [2325. 42-2327. 88] I am the market leader. [2327. 88-2329. 52] If there is no case, [2329. 52-2331. 70] Unless I'm right. [2331. 70-2334. 08] Or I'll do it.

[2334. 08-2335. 86] The boss operates this company again. [2335. 86-2337. 88] I am full. [2337. 88-2341. 32] I am waiting for every important case every time. [2341. 32-234. 14] Therefore, [2343. 14-2345. 12] Because we become an investment enterprise. [2345. 12-2346. 70] We have only one risk.

[2346. 70-2348. 06] Systemic risk. [2348. 06-2348. 46] So we must first say one thing every time. [2348. 46-2348. 62] So we must first say one thing every time. [2348. 62-2348. 88] So we must first say one thing every time. [2348. 88-2348. 98-2349. 08] So we must first say one thing every time. [2348. 98-2349. 08]

[2349. 08-2349. 48] So we must first say one thing every time. [2349. 48-2349. 78] So we must first say one thing every time. [2349. 78-2350. 32] So we only need one risk. [2350. 46-2350. 70] So we must first say one thing every time. [2350. 70-2351. 14] So we must first say one thing every time. [2351. 14-2353. 14] If such a systemic risk.

[2353. 14-2355. 70] We have no confidence in ourselves. [2355. 70-2356. 70] Right. [2356. 70-2357. 22] Right. [2363. 12-2363. 36] Good. [2363. 36-2356. 94] If you have any further questions, we are very grateful. [2365. 94-2366. 92]

[2366. 92-2368. 92] Sharing of Kaihong's management team. [2368. 92-2371. 06] So today Kaihong's book will be here. [2371. 06-2371. 70] Take a minute. [2371. 70-2372. 82] Thank you for your investment. [2372. 82-2373. 58-2375. 28] This advanced with legal person.

[2375. 28-2377. 70] Because he who is going to go to Low Show. [2377. 70-2379. 20] Both of them go first. [2379. 20-2380. 38] Go first. [2380. 38-2407. 40] Slowly slam more Uma.
