<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like there are lots of timestamps and corresponding sentences, some sentences may be duplicates, such as multiple occurrences of the "thank you", some may be garbled or irrelevant content, such as "mamto. nutzen B" and "watch Davide". However, according to the user's requirements, even if these content looks problematic, it cannot be deleted or modified, it must be preserved as it is. Next, I need to sort these timestamps and sentences in chronological order and organize them into paragraphs. Each timestamp corresponds to a sentence, and I need to make sure that each sentence appears in the right place.

During the processing process, I need to make sure that no sentences are missing, even if some sentences look uncoherent or duplicated. For example, "Thank you for watching" is repeated many times, and must be kept completely. At the same time, note whether the format of the timestamp is correct, whether there is a typo or format error, such as "[482. 00-509. 98]" and "[510. 02-512. 00]" have the correct junctions between "[482. 02-512. 00]".

In addition, some sentences may contain garbled or non-Chinese characters, such as "поб", "ляЌ", "ляЌ", etc., which also need to be retained as they are, and cannot be modified. The user may want these contents to remain in the final paragraph, even if they look incorrect. When organizing paragraphs, I need to arrange the timestamps and corresponding sentences in order, and divide them into natural paragraphs. For example, the legal description of the session section about Hang Seng Aviation Industrial Co., Ltd. may be merged into a paragraph, and the subsequent "thank you" duplicated part may need to process separately, but the user requests do not delete anything, so it must be retained completely. Finally, check that the entire paragraph-based verbatire text conforms to the user's: no need to remove any sentences, maintain the original order, correct timestamps, and everything.

The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim transcript (totally retain all original content, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed): The online explanation of Hanson Aviation Corporation will begin in two minutes. The agenda for today's conference will be presented first. A QA will be carried out after the presentation. The online text questions and voice questions will be opened after the President's question form. mamto. nutzen B.

Thank you for watching. Bro. M. etc.

Land, religion, loyalty, up-and-down, yes, what.

Children, lost. ляь. bamboo. Taste. Enabled for the electric power of the grid.

We all know that. I hope that this will lead us to a transformation of our future as a whole. I can also hope that the next good foundation will be a good foundation. So let's ask the director Qin for a briefing on the operating part. Thank you all.

Mr. Qin then asked for a briefing on the current operation status of the company. There was a briefing on the current operation status of the company. Mr. Qin asked for a friend of the Falun Dafa. Then, on the company's operation, a focus is a report. In just one of the support of our vice president, Mr. Qin, there are probably some highlights of the company this year as well.

Then later I made a note of what I didn't report. And then I made a note. Well. Well, I'm reporting today, and I'm going to divide this part into five points first. That's on the next page. That's just mentioned that the total revenue is basically growing more than last year, and it's a new high in history.

From the point of view of this business, in the past year, our total business share is quite, about 50 percent is a 50 percent of our revenue. That in the civil business, part of the civil business is about one-fourth, which is more than last year's growth.

This is where we can see the entire credit market, and we have to report to you that the military industry announced by the President of the House of Representatives is based on the five credit industries, which are mainly part of the military industry to build the autonomous energy and energy of the defense industry. That is, as we have done in the past, the defense autonomous part, basically the part that he emphasizes is part of the drone supply chain. So this part of his promotion strategy is to make use of the market we need, that is, the establishment of one of these drones he has driven by his predecessors, so that we all want to develop these energy in the country.

So this part is a driving strategy of a system integration of a whole drone. That is, we in the aerospace part basically do not continue the policy of this part of the international creation, we are basically or part of a systemic circle of aircraft, and I am still a trend to develop, which is also a focus.

At the same time, it is a part of F16, because the state has made 66 new F16s, so what is the whole future opportunity? That is, this manufacturing opportunity in this part has more than 200. That in this part of the whole to build this autonomous energy, this is also the whole focus of the future.

In this case, the most important thing in this case is the production of this high-end machine. That is, the so-called high-end machine is a maintenance business, because the high-end machine has already delivered 18 units this year, which was originally the contract to deliver 18 units. That year there were three more planes already handed over, and now there are two more planes. The two planes that have been set up in Taitung and the mountains have started to carry out some maintenance business. In this case, in addition to the maintenance business of the high-end machine, because the company has performed well in part of the commerce committee in the past, so we are in addition to the IDF of this IDF, we have a large counterfeit dealer and military use, that is a commercial helicopter in this part of the business, we have to fight a lot of the business.

That's why last year we had more than 30 billion dollars in one takeover of our entire military business, and we'll be taking over the next few years. That's part of the defense market, and we've just seen this part of the policy that depends on the president. That's why the Ministry of Economic Affairs also set up in September last year is the overseas business alliance of Taiwan's outstanding drones. The focus of this alliance is basically to support domestic manufacturers to develop this drone industry.

In the process, we also have the opportunity to go abroad to exhibit or visit some of our partners. So I hope that in the future, we can increase our purchasing of Taiwan. From raw materials to components and parts and the structure of the machine to the whole machine, that is, the product of the drone machine, basically, we want to do an expanded part of this business opportunity to be able to produce such an opportunity.

At the same time, through the calculation process of these manufacturers, we are able to access the technology of the repair and then promote our ability to self-repair. The part of the drone anti-reflection system, we have been flying with the domestic, that is, in the military commerce chamber, we have helped him do a business of making drones. At the same time, we are part of the anti-reflection system.

[977. 98-981. 98] We have also started last year. [981. 98-984. 98] That we are currently planning to produce this year. [984. 98-981. 98] The future of our entire anti-counterfeiting system. [987. 98-991. 98] We will work with one of the national infrastructure needs. [991. 98-994.9 98] We will drive this product in our country. [994. 98-998. 98] Then we will turn this into a commercialized product.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript:. This stage will be responsible by the Vice President of Gold and the company's management team. We will reply to the pre-arranged questions first and then ask questions online. There is the Vice President of Cash.

We have just reported the whole business situation before, so if the answer is not answered to some questions, then we can ask the legal person to put the question to us when we continue to ask questions, and we will do an explanation on the scene and the seat. Well, first of all, I am sure I will do a explanation on our previous question. The first question is to ask the full year 2024 revenue and gross profit performance, is this revenue growing quarterly? What are the major projects for all kinds of business? So I just wanted to do some explanation on the second half of the Qin's market outlook and business layout, so I don't stress here anymore.

That's because the expected rate for this year is 7 and 18, and 7 are not delivered last year. That's because the contract is 18, and we have completed all the missing projects from last year on April 2, so it's been proven. So I think we should also see the media report today, the 18 we're doing our best efforts this year, should we go in the direction of this transaction, we should go in the direction of the expected 2025, that's the problem of the shortage, we're mainly in Haniwel's engine and the oil tanks, and these companies will continue to focus on these suppliers, and communicate with them closely.

The third issue is the progress of the H1W maintenance business, which the Ministry of Defense H1W the cobra attack helicopter is a violation, we have reached the target on September 12 last year, that the company has reached the target, the next year we until the end of December 120, a total of 8 years to meet the contract amount is about 3.2 billion, that is because it is an open maintenance contract, so we will according to the actual performance of the maintenance contract to the customer. The next issue is the evolution of the F16 maintenance center, the F16 maintenance center of our open contract until the end of this year, the company will continue to strive for this new business, we will help the army to win the three high demand, three high price is the high efficiency and long-term project.

In addition to this, we also have a strategic direction with the government, which is in line with the government's strategic direction, the future release of the military rules of the drone business opportunities, especially on counter-revolutionary systems, we will have to make full efforts to fight for some of the relevant orders. In addition to the increase in defense budget, the military will also require this to improve efficiency, so we expect that the government will continue to have some of the planned budgets in the equipment for some maintenance updates, as well as purchase some new combat weapons systems.

First of all, we all know that Chairman Hu is the chairman of this excellent UAV alliance in China, the main purpose of this alliance is to help some UAV industry in China, and then help them into the international market. At present, the main task is to use this exhilarating core technology to do a development, and then as now the main focus is on our so-called three-step soft, these three precision is the flight control chip and its module with its communication chip, and the next one is the satellite positioning chip with this module, and these three soft words are the software that refers to flight control and ground control.

The main parts of the drone anti-reflection system, including the active radar passive radar and the EOIR, are an optical sensing eye.

**2001. 98-2004. 98** There is also electronic anti-interference communication. **2004. 98-2008. 98** is again a hard-coded command control center. **2008. 98-2010. 98** Our company used this time. **2010. 98-2017. 98** The first time the radar developed this radar technology and experience above. **2017. 98-2023. 98** We will integrate the general radar products of domestic manufacturers and some products of optics with their radar.

**2023. 98-2026. 98** We have these core technologies. **2026. 98-2029. 98** We have developed our own anti-counterfeiting system in China. **2029. 98-2033. 98** We have built our own strong industry chain. **2033. 98-2038. 98** We will have our first finished product in about June. **2038. 98-2045. 98** This year we are looking to start fighting for a positive share of some of the nation's key infrastructure. **2045. 98-2052. 98** In the next five years we expect to be able to leverage on this market expansion and technological advancement.

**2052. 98-2055. 98** is able to increase some of the company's revenues. **2055. 98-2058. 98** This is a drone answer. **2058. 98-2065. 98** The next question is the growth prospects of component manufacturing and repair business. **2065. 98-2067. 98** I want to make and repair parts business. **2067. 98-2070. 98** We follow our existing product portfolio. **2070. 98-2072. 98** This is what our customers require.

**2072. 98-2076. 98** We believe that the second half of the year will be better than the first half. **2076. 98-2080. 98** We will continue to have a trend of growth throughout the year. **2082. 98-2086. 98** We will then receive a Boeing order from the US government fighter jets. **2086. 98-2090. 98** Is there a positive impact on the company? **2090. 98-2096. 98** We also watch the media reports that Boeing received this 6th generation of fighter jets. **2096. 98-2097. 98**

**2097. 98-2098. 98** A positive news. **2098. 98-2101. 98** However, according to previous experience. **2110. 98-2105. 98** The fifth generation of fighter jets were developed from development to mass production. **2105. 98-2109. 98** It took about five to seven years to complete. **2109. 98-2115. 98** This is especially true for this fighter jet. **2115. 98-2118. 98** It is difficult to assess at this stage.

**2118. 98-2122. 98** He has a positive impact on Taiwan's too strong company. **2122. 98-2125. 98** If there is a chance, we will fight for it. **2125. 98-2126. 98** will never be absent. **2127. 98-2129. 98** This is one of our plans. **2129. 98-2131. 98** Let's take a look now. **2131. 98-2135. 98** The next problem is Boeing and Airbus.

**2135. 98-2138. 98** Civil aviation market. **2138. 98-2141. 98** There is also a progress of Boeing resumed work. **2141. 98-2144. 98** Based on reports, this is also true. **2144. 98-2148. 98** 737max and some other double-walker aircraft products. **2148. 98-2151. 98** They are constantly receiving new orders. **2138. 98-2154. 98** The current transaction is quite smooth.

**2154. 98-2156. 98** This is based on the amount of 54 delivered in February of last year. **2156. 98-2159. 98** The same period this year has delivered 89 volumes. **2159. 98-2161. 98** So it is seen that the problem of Boeing's initial strike has been solved. **2161. 98-2167. 98** The current factor affecting his capacity is mainly due to his quality problem. **2167. 98-2172. 98** He spends a considerable amount of time in quality inspections.

**2177. 98-2181. 98** So he currently has his actual machine condition. **2181. 98-2186. 98** So he has a growing space. **2186 98-2193. 98** What about the empty 8? **2195. 98** The cumulative number of February we reported is 65. **2199. 98-2202. 98** Last year it was 79. **2202. 98-2205.

**2205. 98-2209. 98** This is also due to the supply chain power outage issue. **2209. 98-2211. 98** In addition to this tariff. **2211. 98-2216. 98** There is politics. **2216. 98-2222. 98** So these supply chain challenges. **2222. 98** We still have some uncertainties. **222.2 98**

**2222. 98-2224. 98** Again, the expected delivery amount of $7.4 billion may be listed in 2024. **All is due to a penalty for late delivery in higher education. **233. 98** The possibility of a penalty for recovery. **233. 98** What is the amount of expected delivery penalty in 2025? **245. 98** What is expected to increase revenue and profit in 2025? **245. 98** What is expected to increase profit in 2025?

**245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025. **245. 98** Estimated increase in 2025.

In the biomedical sector, we also plan to invest in some of the precision manufacturing facilities of biomedical, which will promote the development of the entire medical technology and a diversification of the market. We are also expected to share with the SPRG, today we are a sharing of the integrated resources of technology, and in-depth exchanges, hoping that the two sides can start an innovative business in different fields.

In the case of carbon transfer, according to the government's 2025 greenhouse gas emissions, it reaches the threshold of 25,000 tonnes of factories, which must be paid in 2022. Our company, as of the first quarter, one emissions of our plant, we estimate that the first quarter is not more than 25,000 tonnes. That for our plant will not have an impact, we have to try to do a test, we have to use a data of our entire greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and we have a plant of more than 25,000 tonnes.

Thank you, Mr. Qin. What is the expected gross profit margin in 2020 for the first quarter of 2025 and the outlook for 2025? That is because the financial forecasts of our company are not disclosed here, but the gross profit part of the first quarter will only be reported in the first quarter of May according to the regulations.

In the first part of the military business, we have said before, we have added a new IDF and AJT maintenance order, we expect about 30 billion of orders, which is expected to be fulfilled in 2 to 6 years, a progress recognition, then can pay attention to a lot of the company's revenue. Then again, IDF performance enhancement program has been around 10 years since the end of the IDF, that for future consideration of the topic of sexual injuries and performance improvement, we are currently fighting for some of the IDF's business group plans, as well as improving the IDF's electronic combat capabilities, because of the current modern battlefield environment. Then, we have been actively promoting the business, including the management of the aircraft commissioned and the business of the system, the maintenance models of these helicopters include UH60M AH1WAH64, which we will continue to strive for some relevant business.

So we are just talking about the second major project of this market business outlook and layout, please take a closer look at the briefing. Well, there are no further funding or expansion plans. In consideration of the major shareholders of our company, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Japan, he is currently adding capital in this administrative operation, and we do not want to say dilution of the proportion of the public shares, coupled with the consideration of the size of our future business and the extent of the growth, as well as one of the largest interests of shareholders, so we do not currently have some plans to increase.

The main products are civil or military products. What is the overall steel forging plant this year and the future for the company's greatest attention? Is it estimated that the growth rate in revenue in recent years? Here is the record of our steel forging plant was officially opened on April 2, and our forging plant has reached a power of thermal film forging and temperature forging, then our current temperature forging is our main development project, including military and civilian engine parts, which is mainly locked in the turbine disc and blades and engine brackets, etc., and then we have completed the set-up, which is to obtain some quality certification of related products.

Forged materials are the most difficult to obtain in one of the divisions of the aviation engine, which is currently controlled by a few major manufacturers abroad, so now the engine industry is there to have one of our forging factory completed, we will be in this engine a forging factory to be completed, we will be in this forging direction to develop, then we need to prioritize the global aerospace industry supply chain, we will be in the future we will be in this aviation forging a South China market. Next is to want to know about the prospect of cooperation with the ship center, there is the future planning.

If you have any other questions, you are welcome to put the problem in the chat room first. There are advanced problems in the chat room here, ask the company how to assess the possibility of homet force majeure events to stop shipping, will the company be affected?

Let's start with the first question.

The second question is whether the company evaluates whether the tariff share ratio between suppliers and aircraft manufacturers affected by the aerospace tariffs, and how the ratio will affect the company's gross interest rate, because this message was issued only on April 2, the new Trump tariff 2.0 tariff data, 32%. According to our current contract, and whether it is part of the aircraft or the engine part, the tax in the contract is zero and will not be affected, but whether the new contract is going to go, the customer will not make some adjustments, and we do not know.

That's why we recommend that the company's 2025 operating expenses should be comparable to last year's, which is a reference. And that's another question, I'll look directly at this question, and I'm wondering how much this year's tax rate is estimated. Well, in the previous year 112, we're a revenue of 39 billion yuan, that's 113 billion, that's about 22%, that's about 22%, that's what we expect this year, that's the same level of income, and that's a bit of a good level.

In the United States, if we really speak of the United States as a 28 percent, can we allow European manufacturers and vacancy supply chains to fill this gap? Because this we continue to, because now we are talking about the growth of the order, but it is now the tariff problem, we may have to look at it again, but we will continue to fight. The next question is how to buy raw materials from the United States, how much raw materials from the U.S.? How much is the raw materials from the U.S.?

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how to make a reasonable segmentation while keeping the timestamp correctly mapped.

First of all, I will read through the whole transcription to identify different topics or conversational rotations. For example, the beginning part discusses raw materials and tariffs, followed by a discussion about delivery time, fines, new plan restarts, drone orders, European customers, AJT fines, smart-fly orders, Stakecom bids, power island projects, defense business growth, fine payments, and regulatory issues.

I will then process the format of the timestamp. The format provided by the user is [time range], which needs to be retained during the conversion, but may need to adjust the position to make it more consistent with paragraph-based reading habits. For example, place the timestamp at the beginning of each segment, or insert it in the appropriate place to ensure that the reader can clearly see the timing of each comment.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to spoken expressions, such as fill words, such as "hm", "Ah", and repeated sentences, such as "we have not yet evaluated", which need to be retained as it is, and cannot be modified. At the same time, the interactive parts of the conversation, such as questions and answers, should be kept in the original order and structure to ensure that the context is coherent. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as how to handle jumps between timestamps, such as [3646. 98-3647. 98] and [3647. 98-3648. 98], the same speaker needs to be combined.

In addition, some sentences may cross multiple timestamps and need to check if they belong to the same paragraph. Finally, after the initial draft, I will check again to see if everything is converted correctly with no omissions or errors. Make sure that the corresponding sentences for each timestamp are correctly placed in the paragraph, and that the overall structure is clear and easy to read. At the same time, verify that all the requirements of the user, especially not deleting, not rewriting anything, maintain the integrity of the original. </think> Here is a paragraph verbatim script (fully retaining all the original content, adjusting typography and punctuation only): [356. 98-3567. 98]

[3567. 98-3570. 98] should now be able to stay in control. [3570. 98-3575. 98] Just after the whole new tariff is passed down. [3575. 98-3579. 98] How can this change between the customer and the vendor? [3579. 98-3582. 98] Everyone is constantly looking forward to it. [3582. 98-3586. 98] Here's another question. [3586. 98-3588. 98]

[3588. 98-3591. 98] will start trading in the second quarter of 25 years. [3594. 98-3594. 98] The 18 price to pay in 2025. [3594. 98-3597. 98] So the 25th half of the year may be. [3597. 98-3601. 98] Is there a partial fine for AJT. [3601. 98-3604. 98] Just as our show director has answered well. [3604. 98-3607. 98] According to the contract, this year will still be.

[3607 98-3610. 98] This year there will still be. [3610. 98-3615. 98] It was just mentioned to strengthen the space-breaking technology. [3615. 98-3618. 98] The new female program was planned to be restarted. [3618. 98-3621. 98] I think this is a problem with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. [3621. 98-3623. 98] We have no way to answer. [3623. 98-3626. 98] The previous probe lines were reversible.

[3627. 98-3630. 98] Cotai's current production technology. [3630. 98-3637. 98] Whether to plan to participate in more than 600 intermediate drone tables. [3637. 98-3640. 98] This we do not have at the moment. [3640. 98-364.2. 98] We do not have this. [3642. 98-3643. 98] We do not have this. [3643. 98-3645. 98] Should be colored.

[3645. 98-3646. 98] He said. [3646. 98-3647. 98] He said. [3647. 98-3648. 98] He said. [3648. 98-3649. 98] He said not. [3649. 98-3651. 98] You are talking about a new order or not. [3651. 98-3651. 98]

[3652. 98-3655. 98] This question can be further explained. [3655. 98-3657. 98] Deputy General Manager I added. [3657. 98-3663. 98] In fact, if we say that two years ago, we would mention that it is to be entered into a hot thread compound. [3663. 98-3665. 98] Then that is the product of the empty space. [3665. 98-3667. 98] That is the current progress of this product. [3657. 98-3669. 98] We are currently in development.

[3669. 98-3671. 98] That we have specific. [3671. 98-3673. 98] We also went to JEC vice-president to talk to the air. [3673. 98-3678. 98] Now we are talking about the cooperation project. [3682. 98-3686. 98] So there is no mention of this 600 or more. [3687. 98-3689. 98]

[3689. 98-3694. 98] None of these two things is that the composite material is talking about the cooperation with the empty space two years ago. [3694. 98-3696. 98] is still evolving. [3696. 98-3698. 98] is still developing. [3698. 98-3700. 98] So this year will not ship. [3700. 98-3701. 98] Yes. [3700. 98-3703. 98] Is there any other new product.

[3703. 98-3706. 98] For example, such as a chair. [3706. 98-3707. 98] does not have a seat. [3707 98-3709. 98] We did not do it. [3709. 98-3711. 98] Never done it. [3711. 98-3715. 98] Then that 6 should be 633. [3715. 98-3717. 98] More than 600 units of defense department.

[3717. 98-3725. 98] A few weeks ago, there was an order to openly ask for an order for more than 600 UAVs of a metaphor. [3725. 98-3728. 98] This we had to do to cut into. [3728. 98-3731. 98] That you said it was a UAV of the military trilogy. [3734. 98-3737. 98] Military regulations may be organized. [3734. 98-3731. 98] But military regulations are basically still passed through the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

[3741. 98-3745. 98] Because what we have done in the past is the military rules we have made in the past. [3745. 98-3751. 98] The wheels we have made in the past are from a bill from the Academia Sinica. [3751. 98-3753. 98] He is not currently in a public request phase. [3753. 98-3759. 98] It is unclear what his bill is. [3759. 98-3746. 98] We are going to evaluate him in real-time. [3754. 98-3766. 98] So this has not yet been evaluated.

[3766. 98-3769. 98] No knowledge of this. [3769. 98-3773. 98] We have not evaluated this yet. [3773. 98-3774. 98] We have not yet entered this. [3776. 98-3778. 98] 633. [3778. 98-3784. 98] Whether or not we intend to cut into European defense customers such as Rhine Metal.

[3784. 98-3786. 98] We have previously reported with you. [3786. 98-3789. 98] This means that Europe's defense orders are currently not picked up. [3789. 98-3792. 98] We also know that Rhine Metal has been expanding his capacity. [3792. 98-3795. 98] We will fight for it if we have a chance. [3795. 98-3800. 98] The future may be on some show or a customer's visit. [3800. 98-3803. 98]

[3804. 98-3810. 98] That AJT fine is currently in the middle of the department of emergency relief. [3810. 98-3812. 98] We have not continued to work on it. [3812. 98-3815. 98] It was just the director of Xiuyuan here that he made a statement. [3815. 98-3819. 98] The AJT that fell down before that day is now a preliminary attribution of responsibility. [3819. 98-3823. 98] This I think should be the one responsible by the military. [3823. 98-3832. 98] The commercial drone order of Zhifei is mainly responsible for what production.

[3832. 98-3836. 98] We are responsible for the production of 96 parts of the machine. [3836. 98-3839. 98] Assembling this part of the 96 parts. [3839. 98-3846. 98] The progress of Sttakecom's bid should be in April. [3846. 98-3849. 98] Sttakecom is the plan of the Fenglin Lan. [3849. 98-3853. 98] The progress of that April will be in April. [3853853. 98-3855. 98] The progress of the bid is not yet in April.

[3855. 98-3860. 98] The main city of Power Island assists customers to build solar winds and degassing schedules. [3860. 98-3861. 98] Yes. [3861. 98-3861. 98] We assisted to do this, so we wanted our own demonstration case. [3868. 98-3868. 98] Then we started working on EDC for the whole EDC. [3868. 98-3876. 98] I just mentioned that the national defense business's annual view is either a number or two. [3876. 98-3879. 98] I just didn't hear very well.

[3879. 98-3882. 98] Just said that you answered no. [3882. 98-3883. 98] Yes. [3883. 98-3884. 98] Let me tell you a little more first. [3884. 98-3888. 98] This defense business may still be flat. [3888. 98-3890. 98] That civil business should be. [3890. 98-3891. 98] Yes.

[3891. 98-3894. 98] is still a digit growth. [3894. 98-3898. 98] I just wanted to make a presentation in front of us. [3898. 98-3900. 98] We want to make a transformation. [3900. 98-3903. 98] Because of the confirmation of the teaching machine and the next generation of the machine, we are now looking for new business. [3903. 98-3906. 98] That is what we are working on. [3906. 98-3909. 98]

[3909. 98-3916. 98] The further penalty portion of Q1 can be paid out. [3916. 98-3917. 98] This should not be. [3917. 98-3919. 98] No. [3919. 98-3920. 98] What does Xiu Yan say. [3920. 98-3921. 98] What does Xiu Yan say. [3921. 98-3922. 98]

[3922. 98-3930. 98] Because the penalty this part is directly deducted from the customer's payment. [3930. 98-3935. 98] So it is not clear what your real problem is when you say the payment is completed. [3935. 98-3940. 98] But the penalty we will still be in the first quarter. [3940. 98-3949. 98] This penalty is based on the expected situation of the company until March 31. [3949. 98-3951. 98] This penalty. [3951. 98] As a result of a reduction in income.

[3954. 98-3959. 98] I don't know if this explanation does not meet your problem. [3959. 98-3965. 98] There are other problems. [3965. 98-3970. 98] Do not ask for it. [3970. 98-3971. 98] The power island part. [3971. 98-3974. 98] What we are talking about in Malaysia. [3974. 98-3976. 98] What he will ask for.

[3976. 98-3978. 98] If I want to. [3978. 98-3986. 98] When I need to build a wind farm on the roof or in a private place. [3976. 98-3988. 98]

**Scripture**. He is responsible for the license application, so regulations are not a problem. It is not a problem. This is not a problem?

Is there any other way to do this after you've seen it? is there any other way to do it? is there any other way to do it? is there any other way to do it? is there another way to do it?

The aggressive connection to the defense business in 2020 is currently under ongoing efforts. This part we continue to strive for. Just a few of the business opportunities in our briefings, we've probably already done it. Is there any other problem with the second part of the briefing?

No more questions? Yes. You can also ask verbally. Can't type. Technology services grow in 2025. 2025.

Technology services 2025. This year we have a lot of plans. That's the case of stay calm just said. Then I think everyone should know.

This is the first chance. Yes. If you have no questions about the advanced investment, this is the conclusion of Hanxiang's legal statement. Thank you for representing the management team today.
