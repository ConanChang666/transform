The first part of this page shows that the product portfolio from 2024 to 2025 does not change much. First, please look at the left part of the EMS, the purple part represents the consumer product. The proportion of consumer products in the first quarter of 2025 is increased from the previous 45% to 50%, which is due to the growth of consumer product orders placed by US customers to Malaysia factories, and the importance of EMS Malaysia factories in the future is expected to gradually exceed the Chinese factory.

Linstake joined Jingcheng Technology on April 8, 2025, on page 11, we took a look at Linstake's product portfolio, and the number of Linstake joined Jingcheng Technology on April 8, 2025, and what would happen to the product portfolio. Please take a look at the picture on the left, from the picture on the left, you can see that Linstake's main product is Server, that is the part marked in the picture is dark red, which accounts for about 5 percent of the turnover of Linstake, followed by the consumer product, about 2 percent, that is the light blue part, about 14%, and the other parts of the robot.

At the end of the day, we want you to look at this picture, which is the new product portfolio after the merger of Listech. The main income is still from personal computers, accounting for about 40%, and the server and consumer products account for about 20% of the combined revenue, and the car version accounts for about 15%, Procar accounts for about 5%, and the robot account for about 3%.

In 1964, the company was founded by Hitachi Chemical, which was founded in 1964 by Hitachi, which is a subsidiary of Hitachi Group. In fact, it was founded by a company called Vistek YGA, which was founded in 1949 by Hitachi, and later acquired by Hitachi. In 1972, the factory was established by Hitachi in Singapore.

But in 2020, Hitachi Chemical decided to make this business, which included the CCL manufacturing and PCB manufacturing. The two business entities sold the Street of sale to Showa Electric, and after about two years, there was another Japanese investment company to take over. After the Japanese fund company took over, it was renamed Vistek in around 2021, when 2023.

Vistek's AMERICA, the American company just mentioned, in fact, when Spin-off was out, it has always belonged to Hitachi into the group under the help of the United States to host Vistek, and later in 2023, after the establishment of the company, we also acquired the company, so this April 8, 2025, this year, this is one of our members. The Vistek has a total of five factories, the lower version of the factory, it can produce very high technical capabilities, it can be done 96 percent, where it is mainly used in where? It will be in the semiconductor test, is the so-called ProCard, especially HPM, this high level of memory, it can do 96 percent, its technical capabilities is very special, it says MWB, with the so-PCB is different, it is in the middle of its technology, its line formation is the method of the laminated line, so the laminated line makes the laminar line is very uniform, so it makes its main control of this HPM. The high frequency module in the cell phone, or some IoT module, optical communication module, or some Sensor, sensor, most of the smaller, I put two vision diagrams, this is a very small one, a rod, very small, most of the small module is used, that is, in the self-contained two factories, YGA two factories, is the hotel factory with the factory factory, the main production, there is a factory is the production of automobile-related financing, including aluminum substrate, then racing for, the other factory is the production of electrical appliances products, the factory in Singapore, that is, its technical ability can be up to 50 percent, contains the use of very high-level, high-frequency, high-speed materials, there are many special processes, including the special dental box, multi-cerral box, laser Steel-Vir, and the Vir, which I put a picture in the bottom right corner, this picture, this picture is what they do this rewritten about about 25, and then about, and then about 5 to the V5mm, and even higher. This AI server, or in some ASIC, AI, it needs to be used on the board, which at the same time, it also produces some medical use, which is placed in the human body, or some medical equipment used, so its technical level, and with us generally do the equipment is not the same, because it is placed in the human body, requires high precision, and there are a lot of management and control, that is, the above is the introduction of this grassroots PCB, you guys, comrades, I am Yang Chang, also responsible for Sumi EMC, development and strategy, EMC factory, we have three factories, respectively in Jiangsu Quanshan, Guangdong, Iba, Malaysia, Iba, and Huangjiang factory are more than 20 years of the factory, there is the smallest set up in Huangjiang factory, there are 20 SMP production line, the main service customers in Taiwan, the main products are the following the main consumer is our factory, we are we are the same is the main product, we are the same is the main product is the new product, we are the same is the same is the same with the main product, the main product, we are the new product, we are the new product, we are the new product, we are the new product, we are the same is the same in the same in the same, we are the same, we are the new product, we are the new product, we are the same is the new product, the same is the new product, the same is the SMP.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcription:. The rapid development of AI technology and related applications in China this year. The future product development will focus on AI products and energy-saving energy storage products, which are high value-added products such as AI servers and high-end graphics cards.

In recent years, due to tariffs on China-US trade, many customers have sought production bases outside of China. Malaysia is an advantage in addition to Thailand and Vietnam. Our PSA group has been producing in Malaysia for many years, and the passive cloud PCV and mechanical components have established a complete supply chain.

We continue to expand our SMT production line to 12. We must continue to invest in automation equipment such as automatic arm auto-packing cable type plug-in machines. Increase the technical threshold and quality efficiency to reduce labor costs.

The above report of our two tax associations has been reported to be complete. Now enter the Q&A section. Well, now we start to Q&A. Thank you. Yes, I am a researcher of childhood child labor.

I would like to ask you to introduce a series of technical hierarchy in Japan. I would like to ask you to introduce a series of technical hierarchy of Japan. It may also be interesting to say that he and several of the domestic like elephant shop technical hierarchy of how we look at the current state of TPU here is said to be Google. Yes, I would answer you a question is based on the technical capacity of Listech compared to the factory in Singapore which we first talked about the technical content of the technology compared to the factory in the country I think it is different from the TL1 PC board factory in which I think it is located in TL1, but I can only say that the factory in Singapore it belongs to TL1 in the world in the previous few I believe that it is recognized by many customers.

According to our research, some of the studies we have done before we ordered are also based on the fact that ProCard has a lot of different forms of its application is not the same. So the only thing I have heard from the client and the outside is that their capacity is really good is that they are relatively limited. Just mention that its application is MW's technical ability, so its main resistance control is very good. If it is assumed that the capacity can rise again, I believe it should be better.

The only thing I'd like to ask about this great success is the fact that Listech has just put out a hand gesture to its quarterly revenues in the presentation. So don't want to say what the Focus revenue outlook looks like this year or even this year.

This year, E&S's gross profit margin is slightly better than last year's. So I don't know how to think about this result. Then we have to say that we have a consolidated profit from the monthly process section. So the problem is that revenue has increased, but our profit is not as bright as this revenue performance.

Well, I first answered your question about this Listec. So in the past we actually combined its report from April until the beginning of April. So we asked Hu Ming for a reference before April, so we also heard that after they joined us, we have been helping them calm down during this period to help them with some industry expansion. So from the development point of view.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. In the example given by the user, some sentences may be duplicated or need to be merged, such as the "I think" at the beginning, and may need to be merged into one sentence. However, according to the rules, nothing can be deleted, so all sentences, including the duplicated part, must be retained. Next, I need to re-arrange these verbatim entries into a consistent paragraph.

In addition, the term "BCP Performance" and "Ninstaq's Gross Rate" mentioned by the user may need to be kept as accurate as possible. At the same time, attention to the question and answer structure in the conversation, such as the questioner's question and the answerer's response, needs to be properly segmented to maintain the logic of the conversation. During the processing process, some duplicate or redundant sentences, such as "I think" twice, need to retain the original sentence at this time, but may be smoother by adjusting the punctuation or connection term.

It is also necessary to check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all provided content is properly integrated. For example, the user has some time interval between stamps, and may need to confirm whether it belongs to the same paragraph or different paragraphs. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to ensure that there is no missing sentences, all the contents are arranged in the original order, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, in line with the user's requirements.

I think I should be positive and will continue to grow. This part is good, so the second answer to your question is that after the merger is completed or the first phase of the sterilization is now seen, just before our CFO mentioned that our factory in Ice Town was officially entered into the market last year's fourth quarter. This year, we have always been part of the state of city production or customer collection certification.

I think the benefits of this sterilization will gradually come out later. So what? Then the Chief Financial Officer answered. 60% of the revenue in April grew, but that EBS in Taiwan 0.5 5 and the first quarter of the small stocks to miss a lot. In fact, I have mentioned in the previous report that his report is outside the industry, we have $3.4 billion of stock market items, so let the first quarter EBS increase by 0.7. So if you cut off EBS 1057 in the first quarter, the performance of this first quarter is likely to be 0.8, so back to the public's problem.

In the second quarter, the performance was some small shares, because I remember the same period last year, so your revenue problem is nearly the same as last year, because we announced in April is a merger, so you are more likely to have a recession than the first quarter, and the result is 13%, so I would say that this recession is the main difference, because there are a few costs for couples, and I think this is not an efficient way to deal with you, because the old factory is working at the same time, because the old factory is working at the same time, it is actually working, and it is actually working, yes.

I'm sorry, but another one. I'd like to talk to you about ProCard business, which is currently only the main supply to a strong trader, and that you have about five, more than one customer, but because ProCard's customer base is not so much as the cost of consumption, it is a number of customers, but the first customer impression I have accounted for it about more than three-fourths of the revenue, probably this. Understand, I want to wrap up again is just the advanced chairman of Ninstaq talking about the part of Ninstaq, so he said that Ninstaq's gross rate is equivalent to about about, that compared with the company's existing gross rate or PCB business is not good, there are some cases in the disease treatment.

This is the first time that we have been able to offer our products to our customers. We believe that we will be able to provide them with a better service. We believe that we will be able to provide them with a better service and a better service. We believe that we will be able to provide them with a better service and a better service. We believe that we will be able to provide them with a better service and a better service.

This is a very difficult question to answer. I have mentioned that since it is in Japan and Singapore, it is different from the two different countries, except the language theory, there are some differences on culture. So I think that maybe this integration to the degree, when will the effect you ask will come out, I think, two quarters, or longer, I can't answer you right now, but we will definitely try to be as quick as possible, bad?

The first question is about the cost. From a psychiatrist's point of view, the cost of our business is probably around 8% to 100% of my revenue. That Minspec is a bit higher than we are, and that is how we will control our merchandise teachers in the future. In this part of the parallel plant, we are divided into two phases.

We may take into account the investments in servers, AI, and HDI that have just been mentioned in the second phase. So answering your questions, the amount of the current investment in this plant is rising from the amount that will continue to be invested in the future. So the water conservancy I think will grow faster with this investment, and it will gradually come out of this filtered condensation phase. We will continue to invest again, so maybe you want me to stop deliberately, and then from losing your time, I'll be more able to give you thanks.

I am now answering your question. First of all, Linstack Singapore is more than just an AI client, and its data is more than just a client, that is, we are not easy to explain the specifics of their clients here. The AI or the server that we used to have, we do know that we have a high interest in both and many Linstacks, which is what we are working on right now to leverage different venues, then technical capabilities, and the purpose of assisting them in the transition.

We are currently in the balance, because we are currently in the production of Taiwan's currency, which actually has a huge impact on Taiwan's shipping. That's because China's freight, we are in the future, we are looking at China's exchange rates are actually using people's exchange rates, so the current problem is still in the defense.

This is not the case with Nation, which is a general server, which is the AI server. It was just mentioned by our Chinese president that the server in the Chinese language, about 18% of our revenue, now about 18%, about 18%. Then, after Nistake got into the GPA, and by the factory in Singapore, most of the revenue is related to the server. So after the core and return, the whole of our PCB, I can say that the AI-related things, the revenue in our PCB is more than 20%.

This is a, OK, in terms of area, you can see, do what AI, or do the HDI information version factory, rarely he will talk about production capacity, so you see us in the past years, we are less and less talk about production capacity, because whether it is HDI or AI related things, its level is high, the change is large, and then its process is relatively more complex, so on this side, it is difficult to see how much you can see from the area alone or how much you can do, because especially the design of the client, such a complicated process, so you may not be from the first station to the last station is the equivalent of production capacity, this is the root of production, it is actually has change, sometimes, some of the special design, will make our output will be limited.
