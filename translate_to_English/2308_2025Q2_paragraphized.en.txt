We will also ask this Ronnie first to go through the second quarter and then the first half of the year, and then we will open the question on the site, and if we have time, we will open the question online. Ronnie. Well, as I am here to report this number to you first. Of course, the numbers will be published the day before, and we will announce the number of the first half of the year.

The second quarter of the year was a record high, in fact, our first quarter was also the same, the second quarter grew 4% more than the first quarter, which may be a little less than the original expected, the main reason is because our sales are mainly in US dollars, which is because the US dollar is more weak and the Taiwan dollar is more strong, so the conversion to Taiwan dollars is a little less revenue.

Gross margin is 35.5%, which is a bit of a loss of turnover. That's because the product portfolio is good, and our growth momentum is mainly from some high gross profit data center servers, so this is a healthy gross profit. The gross margin was 25% higher than the same period last year, 17% higher than the first quarter of the year. The cost part was 14% higher than the same period last year, the quarter was 7% slower than the first quarter of the year, but the cost ratio was 20.4% faster than the first quarter of the year.

That is why Operating Profit is also a record high of 187 billion yuan, which is a 42% increase over the same period last year, and a 33% increase over the first quarter. This revenue is the same as profit here. The revenue growth is the fastest in infrastructure, and of course the profit is the same, which is mainly because the data center these infrastructure growth, especially this liquid cooling business.

That automation is a little similar, because the situation of the market as a whole has some obvious links with this tariff, and of course it is not good. The outside part of the industry is a little bit a little bit of this quarter, but there is a small exchange loss, which is mainly because the Taizhu in the second quarter also has some appreciation, we are usually more related to Taizhu, and then the investment there also listed some losses, the rest are quite normal, so the whole word is a little bit of the amount. So before the net profit and EBITDA in the second quarter is actually new high, it is about 196 billion and about 268 million, Margins is basically a new high, about 20%, 30% growth compared to the same period last year.

I made a few questions first. Then I took this picture of the big market. Let's talk about what we think. Then ask the chairman to do these details for us. Our company itself details these instructions. That's what I thought before.

Some of you have already mentioned that. These hyperscaler. Its capax is a sufficient increase. Then this AI data center. This is already a big increase. The AI data center was built.

There is a little bit like arm's reach. It can't stop. It's because it doesn't do other components. It's mentioned before that it's next. It should look like this trend should not change for two or three years. It's also about seeing what they're doing here.

The AI data center is above. It's probably what its revenue is going to be like. I think it's the second quarter of this year's number. Now a few hyperscalers should be just that. It's Amazon.

That's what I remember if I didn't. Meta should be like 22% growth. Alpha should be like 39% growth. That's why they do.

Then he went on to say, "This is what the Lord says: 'This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, this is the way, walk in it, walk in it, and walk in it.'

He is the One who is the One who is the source of all life, and He is the One who is the source of all life; He is the One who is the source of all life, and He is the One who is the source of all life, and He is the only One who is the source of all life.

Donald Trump called him that. one big beautiful bill passed. This bill was passed. It's like this bill. It's pretty good for this technology sector. That's the incentive and credit.

I have seen some of them, and I have seen some of them. This is probably the range of the whole incentive. It's about 50 to 60 billion. That's what this turned out to be. These companies now do these spending. In fact, it's on top of his tax and so on.

They are very helpful, so look at them. It should not be in the short term. It should not be reduced. So the whole building above AI data center is said to be subjective.

It is not a good thing. Some of our own development is not to ask the chairman to explain to us. Data center or data center here. Our products are now fully equipped. That power is, of course, from the data center inside.

Whether it's inside the cabinet or outside the data center, we've got these programs too. Of course, there's the organic cabinet inside the data center, and then there's this one on the board.

Yes. Cooling is on the board. It is on the cabinet. liquid to air is liquid to air. liquid to liquid to liquid is probably not started yet.

That's what the market is all about. That's all about readying to see cooling here. Or rather, it's in the Data center. It's cooling outside of the Data center, and we don't involve.

It's pretty much what it does outside of it. So long as there's a Data center built, it should be good in this respect. That's the Data center. The internal liquid to air. Our market share is very high.

This part of the liquid to liquid. That is to see the whole development because of that will. This involves the whole. The change of the info structure so that the future. How fast it will develop. We are also seeing the possibility.

I am thankful to God for all the blessings He has bestowed upon me, and for all the blessings He has bestowed upon me, and for all the blessings He has bestowed upon me, and for all the blessings He has bestowed upon me.

The provision of the service is the income of the service. It also accounts for a large portion. The future data center is actually. The demand for electricity is more powerful cooling.

The demand is even stronger and needs more service. You can't tell us what it is. Delta is in the service section right now. The layout is included. The number of people includes the contribution of revenue and a thank you for the future growth of Outlook.

This is one of the ways that we are able to do this, and that we are able to do it in the right way, or in the wrong way, or in the wrong way.

This product is of course slowly extended to this system, the installation of this system is followed. This product is backed by this system. Continued service is this general. This part is the real part of this service.

There are very few things we can do now, and we will do this in the future, and we will do this in the future, and we will do this in the future, and we will do this in the future.

How to evaluate it KPI. This is going to take a while. I'll mention this service a little bit later. Because we've been watching this service here, you just mentioned Virtip because of it. This service has been going on for a long time.

It's not called virtip. It's basically this service. business is very common. fragmented many of them are so-called mom and pop shop. There's a recent trend. That's some private equity.

Start buying some of these small ones. Good service business. Gather them together. Of course we are also here. There is no part of this we can participate in. Of course, if you are in the data center you are divided.

This white space follows gray space. Of course, this is traditional. Generally, people think it's because it's white space.

So we have to think about it. Of course, we have to look at this, it's not all of these hyperscaler it or some big color it is that you say that this company needs service will buy this product with you, it doesn't look like this, so service business itself must be make sense, so it will go on a larger scale. Hallmaster, thank you for accepting my question, I'm Timson of UBS.

The second question is about the outlook for the second half of this year, so how should we think about this AI server data center so-called demand there will be no air pocket, in this transition process. The second question is because there is a link to the previous one, you asked about the second half of the year is probably not right, the second half of this AI data center demand will not have air pocket. I think there are just a few explanations, that is, you just look at these hyperscalar its CAPEX, I just looked at this meta it would be to 72 billion this year, so the second half of the year should not be too big to be turbulence, and there should be something that is likely to be different.

The second part I would like to ask you about the improvement of the product portfolio, I remember the Chairman before we have revealed to us that the proportion of revenue in this area of AI is not enough to share with us the number of the first quarter and the second quarter of this part of the number, so if you can guess the details, say how many PSU is in the BBU, a good one would be better, thank you. This part of the margin is basically the number of tariffs in our second quarter, then our main incorporation is the customer will pay, some of these we have to pay for the so-called sales costs, shipping costs and tariffs, so the fact is very small. The NRE part is mainly back to our RND expense, we are outside the industry, it will not run into the revenue.

The second question I want to ask is the part of the product roadmap in the future, that we are the power show, the next phase will be the power rack, so I want to tell you, in the power rack part, we expect when will be mass production, then the power rack first is the specification, how many watts, you expect is GB300, it will become mainstream, or wait for VR Robin.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase transcript: [1505. 00-1508. 00] Does NVIDIA have time for him to come out on time? [1508. 00-1511. 00] When it comes to NVIDIA, we know he's an important company, but someone will ask if he's done on time? That's a question, let's think quietly. [1511. 00-1514. 00] That's what you're referring to now.

[1514. 00-1517. 00] No one takes GB300 then he needs this architecture. [1517. 00-1520. 00] It's possible [1520. 00-1523. 00] This is of course the system designer. [1523. 00-1526. 00] What he does.

[1529. 00-1532. 00] We are above this high pressure DC. [1532. 00-1535. 00] For us, it is not strange. [1535. 00-1538. 00] So it is our product. [1538. 00-1541. 00] As long as the customer needs. [1541. 00-1544. 00] We can provide.

[1544. 00-1547. 00] This is what we find difficult to drive. [1547. 00-1550. 00] This demand is because he must have his own. [1550. 00-1553. 00] The whole system he wants to design like this. [1553. 00-1556. 00] Thank you for your understanding. [1556. 00-1559. 00] The last question I have is about the cooling system. [1559. 00-1552. 00] We have also seen in industry research.

[1562. 00-1565. 00] Taiwan's large liquid cooling system is very strong. [1565. 00-1568. 00] The market share is very high. [1568. 00-1571. 00] Currently is also an undemanding situation. [1571. 00-1574. 00] There are even new customers in the second half of the year. [1574. 00-1577. 00] I would like to know what we are planning for this part of production capacity.

[1577. 00-1580. 00] It is expected that next year will be mass production. [1580. 00-1583. 00] How much more capacity will increase. Taiwan's liquid cooling is very strong, the market share is also high, but at present there is a lack of supply, and there are some new customers in the second half of the year. So I want to know how we plan this part of the capacity, and how to plan for mass production next year. [1583. 00-1586. 00] The follow up is said that in this case, we are so strong in this liquid to the air. [1586. 00-1589. 00] As the chairman just said, this is more relevant to the infrastructure.

[1589. 00-1592. 00] That would be a great opportunity for Taiwan. [1592. 00-1595. 00] That's what we're going to do from this system to the infrastructure. [1595. 00-1598. 00] Or we'll look for other people to work on this part. [1598. 00-1601. 00] If we're going to go into the infrastructure, what we're going to do to prepare for this much more. [1601-1604. 00] Thank you. [1604. 00-1604. 00] I'm going to talk about this liquid to liquid well.

[1607. 00-1610. 00] Then Albert you very much like this detail. [1610. 00-1613. 00] We asked the chairman to tell us about this product line. [1613. 00-1616. 00] This liquid is liquid. [1616. 00-1619. 00] Of course, at the present time. [1619. 00-1622. 00] A lot of supercomputers he was watching. [1622. 00-1625. 00] But he did not do so immediately.

[1625. 00-1628. 00] Because just the chairman also mentioned that is to say. [1628. 00-1631. 00] You really do have to do a complete one. [1631. 00-1634. 00] True liquid to liquid your base. [1634. 00-1637. 00] It's different for itself. [1637. 00-1640. 00] So it's probably you're going to have to rebuild one. [1640. 00-1643. 00] Rebuild a data center that you do.

[1643. 00-1646. 00] This liquid to liquid is relatively complete economic comparison. [1646. 00-1649. 00] end to end economic comparison. [1649. 00-1652. 00] That is why this liquid to liquid error. [1652. 00-1655. 00] This part. [1655. 00-1658. 00] My opinion is that it should be maintained for a while. [1658. 00-1661. 00] Of course I say not what we want to see.

[1661. 00-1664. 00] How this market goes. liquid to liquid is a new technology, but it can still be maintained for a while now. [1664. 00-1667. 00] I think you can also see that the recent Amazon he is. [1667. 00-1670. 00] I also proposed that he did not design a name for it. [1670. 00-1673. 00] This enroll key exchange unit. [1673. 00-1676. 00] This enroll key exchange unit. [1673. 00-1676. 00] So it is basically.

[1676. 00-1679. 00] He is also a liquid to the error. [1679. 00-1682. 00] So if he says supercomputer himself. [1682. 00-1685. 00] He wants to do this. [1685. 00-1688. 00] He himself wants to do that, of course. [1688. 00-1691. 00] Other inhouse may do the whole system. [1691. 00-1694. 00] Many components in him should be bought out.

[1694. 00-1697. 00] That I think this data point is given to us. [1697. 00-1707. 00] A conclusion is said to be. [1700. 00-1703. 00] This liquid to error this solution. [1703. 00-1706. 00] It should take some time. [1706. 00-1709. 00] It really waits until next generation liquid to liquid. [1709. 00-1709. 00] You can't do this.

[1712. 00-1715. 00] Or you want a new data center and so on. [1715. 00-1718. 00] Or you want a whole new one. [1718. 00-1721. 00] It takes a little time to reset fit this. [1721. 00-1724. 00] It probably wasn't that fast. [1724. 00-1727. 00] He also asked his colleagues to talk about this liquid to the error. [1727. 00-1732. 00] Actually, his supply chain is complicated.

[1732. 00-1735. 00] Just like that there are very traditional fins. [1735. 00-1738. 00] and that is a big one. [1738. 00-1741. 00] The supply chain is probably still in China. [1741. 00-1744. 00] This component is provided. [1744. 00-1747. 00] The Chinese manufacturer is doing it. [1747. 00-1750. 00] I would look at that cost if I were to do it somewhere else.

[1750. 00-1753. 00] It may be difficult to meet the demand. [1753. 00-1756. 00] So this component of the fan. [1756. 00-1759. 00] These fins are still from China. [1759. 00-1762. 00] We assemble mainly in Taiwan. [1762. 00-1765. 00] Here in Taiwan, we assemble the one. [1765. 00-1768. 00] The fan wall is installed at the end.

[1768. 00-1771. 00] will be in the United States to do it is those controls. [1771. 00-1774. 00] These boards do all these things in the United States. [1774. 00-1777. 00] This is the way our line is now expanding. [1777. 00-1770. 00] It is worth considering. [1780. 00-1783. 00] This piece of Taiwan. [1783. 00-1786. 00] I hope to build it here in Thailand.

[1786. 00-1798. 00] I still talk about that supply chain. [1798. 00-1792. 00] The technical difficulties are still high. [1792. 00-1795. 00] If Thailand is now tariffs. [1795. 00-1798. 00] If there is no movement in 36. [1798. 00-1801. 00] We will probably stop. [1801-1804. 00] We will expand it here in Thailand.

[1804. 00-1807. 00] Because it is a technical problem. [1807. 00-1810. 00] To do this in Taiwan. [1810. 00-1813. 00] It is also difficult for our engineering units. [1813. 00-1816. 00] It is all here. [1816. 00-1819. 00] It is necessary to go to Thailand to build it. [1819. 00-1822. 00] Of course, it is necessary to make the ability there.

[1822. 00-1825. 00] That is. [1825. 00-1828. 00] If the tariff is so high. [1828. 00-1831. 00] I think he went to Thailand with no meaning. [1831. 00-1834. 00] Of course, many of us had his whole process. [1834. 00-1837. 00] There are many of these homes to use. [1837. 00-1840. 00] There are many different kinds of equipments.

[1840. 00-1843. 00] Then there will be a lot of alignment. [1843. 00-1846. 00] And all of them are friends. [1846. 00-1849. 00] So now I'm still speaking. [1849. 00-1852. 00] The material was built from this large institution. [1852. 00-1855. 00] From the mainland and then the main front. [1855. 00-1858. 00] Assembly in Taiwan.

[1858. 00-1861. 00] If the tax rate is changed. [1861. 00-1864. 00] Perhaps the middle section here will be in Thailand. [1864. 00-1867. 00] The whole going to the United States. [1867. 00-1870. 00] This is still considered the total cost. [1870. 00-1873. 00] Because the flag transport is large. [1873. 00-1876. 00] It is also a big problem.

[1876. 00-1879. 00] You are looking for such a supply chain locally. [1879. 00-1882. 00] I think that the cost is very high. [1882. 00-1885. 00] And to provide a lot of it. [1885. 00-1888. 00] The supply may be very difficult. [1888. 00-1891. 00] Thank you very much. [1899. 00-1892. 00] Good management is good.

[1911. 00-1914. 00] Hon Hai also said that MDDR will be here in the United States. [1914. 00-1917. 00] I would like to say that this combination of artificial intelligence robots. [1917. 00-1901. 00] Speaking about the layout of AI robots. [1917. 00-1901. 00]

[1926. 00-1929. 00] So the question is about NTU. [1929. 00-1932. 00] The development of artificial intelligence robots. [1932. 00-1935. 00] Where will be assembled in the future. [1935. 00-1938. 00] Let the chairman answer.

[1938. 00-1941. 00] The robot is a big one later. [1941. 00-1944. 00] A big demand. [1944. 00-194. 00] But I really think of him. [1947. 00-1950. 00] Of course this robot itself. [1950. 00-1953. 00] Regardless of the human type. [1953. 00-1956. 00] The wheel whatever it is.

[1956. 00-1959. 00] order is a four-foot development of all kinds. [1959. 00-1962. 00] This demand will be great. [1962. 00-1965. 00] But the focus is on that.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription content and organize it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that no sentences are deleted, not rewritten, not condensed. The user emphasizes that all content must be retained, and no summaries are made, so my main task is to organize the content of the sentences that were split by time, into a smoother and more consistent paragraphs.

First of all, I look at the provided text structure. There are timestamps before each sentence, such as [1965. 00-1968. 00], followed by the content of the words. These timestamps may help understand the coherence of the context, but they may need to be removed when converting paragraphs, as there is no need for a timestamp in the paragraph.

Similarly, questions and answers about modular data centers should be kept in the same paragraph to ensure consistency of the questions and answers. It is then necessary to pay attention to duplicate content. For example, in [2127. 00-2130. 00] and [2130. 00-2133. 00], there are duplicate sentences, "We set up this research lab in August", and the user requests not to delete anything, so both sentences need to be retained, may need to be merged into a paragraph, or reappear in different paragraphs.

In addition, it is important to handle Chinese punctuation symbols. Chinese use the sentence “. ” instead of the sentence “. ”, which needs to be checked for correct use. At the same time, the question and answer in the conversation should be separated by quotations or appropriate means, but the user has no particular instructions, so it may not be necessary.

At the same time, avoid introducing any additional explanations or junctions, just combine sentences into paragraphs in order. Finally, make sure that all the contents are included without missing any sentences. For example, check if there is a jump or format error, such as if the content corresponds correctly after the timestamp. For example, questions and answers after [2142. 00-2145. 00] need to be ensured that they are coherent and may be divided into two paragraphs.

2. Merge the relevant sentences into paragraphs according to the logic. 3. Check the merge and repeat the content. 4. Make sure the Chinese punctuation is correct. 5. Keep the original sequence, do not delete or rewrite. 6. Verify that everything is contained correctly, no omissions. Now start processing step-by-step and generate the final paragraph verb.

If you are looking at a human robot, you may want to use four feet, he may need to use a human robot, he may need to use four feet, he may need to use a different type, or even a fixed camera, he may also be able to match. If there is an outdoor, he may need to use dragon, so this is an ecosystem, or an application of a collaborative cooperation, very complex. Therefore, we will not just look at the human robot, because the human robot is really more able to see the strength or logistics, such as this factory, such as in some cars and streets, or comparison, I would like to look at this, or in the factory, or in the logistics center, the real service field is very few people in the field of activity, so that is not a lot of people, so that we want to see a lot of this kind of the future, we will see this kind of a lab, and we will see a more a variety of cooperation in August.

This part of the tariffs I want to start first, and I want to say again the last time we talked about the possibility of the end of June this will be a bit clearer. Of course, it is now until the end of July. Honestly, it is not particularly clear at the end of June, because Donald Trump is changing every day, so you get up every morning and look at what new news he has.

In fact, most of the tariffs so far have been absorbed by the U.S. corporation. So just the chairman mentioned that some customers will absorb this part, so of course, you turned to say that the overall price of this kind of price is not particularly bad, because Q2 induction is about 2.5%, the Fed's target is 2%, so it's okay. But how long does it last? To see how long can it last? Because you see a number of large companies such as Ford, Ford spent 800 milli $8 billion on tariffs in the second quarter of the year.

I think that this is the whole world's economy, in fact, the rules are really changing. The new rules, the new rules, Wuhan is gradually forming, it should be kept for a while and it will not be known how long. But it looks like it will last for a while, and that's a new rule.

This is why we started doing this since 15 years ago, the market demand in which the future should be as close to the market as possible, that big direction will not change, but also considering the cost, the bigger issue here may be the supply chain, is that the supply chain is assumed local no, even if you distribute the manufacture, you can only do the latter part of the local cost, what is the tariff, now this pattern, I think that he will change every day, even after August 1, even if he changes daily. We can not follow this change according to his plan to our capacity, we can only do a crisis treatment, this small adjustment, but this is a comparison of long term, two to three years, then it is a relatively large scale, and then it is not only a production base, there will have a whole system structure, or you want to consider the local supply chain.

But if you look at the whole thing, because you said in the previous law that the second quarter because tariff suspension is some customer positive pull, the second half of the above, or there is a traditional high season in the previous year, is there to ask, if such a trend in the second half of this year, these AIS related proportions, will not exceed the first half of this year's these proportions, thank you. There are a few questions, you see this year, only AI is good, other we look at IBA, there is no color, about last year, there is no problem, so if the situation of the second half of the AI is not big problem, about this year is relying on AI, that the pattern is obvious, then it will be better than the first half of the first half, the first half of the first half of the customer is because there is not the same thing, the next time, if we want to ask whether it is the next, if it is the next time, if it is a new, if it is a new product, the next time, if it is a new product is a new, if it is a new. So you assembled your component in the U.S., the component should be taxed, so I don't think it's going to end to say that there will be many changes, this change must be great, because you're light from this semiconductor industry, in fact, 30 years ago, the U.S. in semiconductor above or leading, and then I sometimes talk to some American friends.

You have spent 30 years destroying your semiconductor industry, and of course, you have spent more time, far more than 30 years. What you see is not enough trip act, so this time is actually very long. Then, to see if the U.S. government, the U.S. business community and the U.S. civil society really have this determination. That is, of course, right now, these hyperscalers are in the U.S., so we are close to the market to produce these system products is definitely make sense.

I was wondering if there was a production plan for Thailand, because I just mentioned that the CDU is not there at the moment. Is there another expansion plan in Thailand, or will it continue? Yes, Thailand is still growing. In fact, there are three factories in Thailand that are now in operation, and three are still in operation, so the capacity expansion of Thailand is still ongoing.

In theory, mobility and IABA low margin products are relatively low-growth state, then do we have upside? Maori part is to ask our CFO to help us answer? It is difficult to predict now. The second question is about AI data centers products, how many percent of the prog mix is the application to ASIC, about how much is the GPU application?

Thank you, I can follow up a question about our R&D investment. In fact, it looks like these quarters are about 9.5%, but it looks like we can increase our revenue by at least 20% this year, it looks like next year's business is pretty good. This means that our R&D investment in the future will remain at a 9.5% return, or we will probably be in a quarter of about 12 billion levels? Thank you.

The R&D strategy is not easy to do. Of course, many of the existing business R&D ratios are very stable, which is about 6.7% of the mass production here, and the other is about 7%. In addition, all of these things are above the new things, the new things investment is really big: a corporate R&D, we have a lot of things, a new business, we call these R&D investments here. This is what we are constantly looking for.

When we talk about this part of the AI Data Center, we just mentioned that the words of the people of the AI Data Center in the United States, like the laws of the United States of America, canceled the regenerative aid of the regenerative people, how do we look at the future foreign market? The market in Taiwan is because we see a situation like the blue wave they have these storms, some photovoltaic boards or power outages, and then the third point is that the words like the previous words in the blue wave, like an explosion of a ternary electronics factory, some of the things that affect our excavators, and how they treat them as safe, so I don't know how they think about these three things, and so much.

The previous question was, if in the United States he really had some solar subsidies or related subsidies, they should have been canceled. But as Lambert said earlier, many of his policies, a lot of investments have been built on the string, and in fact, some related renewable energy, his costs have been gradually revealed. The first thing we see again, he's a trend, and we don't think he can be easily stopped. Investors also thought that, in particular, they had Crossover, and some of his futures exist, so we knew that we didn't really stop there in the United States or even in other countries.

The following is the content of the "parallel scripting":. We ask our colleagues to see what we have in this section of the energy storage battery [3441. 00-3444. 00]. The need for energy storage must continue to increase [3447. 00-3450. 00], because as long as the stability of the newable thing [3450. 00-3453. 00], the need for energy storage must be large [3456. 00-3459. 00]. 00, so the demand for energy storage will be large [3459. 00-3462. 00].

For our company, however, that revenue or profit [3489. 00-3492. 00] is not a focus [3492. 00-3495. 00], but it is a must [3495. 00-3498. 00], a component of energy storage in the whole MICROGRID [3504 00-3504. 00] is very important [3504. 00-3507. 00], regardless of the future city of the so-called "Smart City [3513. 00-3513. 00-3513. 00], or the MicroGRID in the Sustainable City [3516. 00-3519], 003553. 0053. 0053. 0053, 0053. 0053. 0053. 0053. 0053. This is the only thing you can do if you want to do something about it? 0035. 00], because we have just mentioned that [3603. 00-3606. 00], if we maintain 36%, the script may be interrupted in Thailand [3606. 00-361. 00], and if we say that today's tax rate is 36% lower than [3615. 00-3618. 00], or even lower than here in Taiwan [3618. 00-3621. 00], how will our other script be appreciated? [3621. 00-3621. 00] If Thailand 36% does not fall, it will have a big impact on next year's Thailand's orders [3627. 00-3633. 00], but I believe he will change [3633. 00-3636. 00], so we can only say that these are our considerations, if he changes [36363.63.63.636. 00], 003645. 0064.
