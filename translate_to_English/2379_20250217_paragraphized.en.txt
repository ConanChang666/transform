The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-text script: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Ivy Chan, RealTech IR Director. Thanks for joining this meeting. At the beginning, I will briefly update our four quarters 24 financial results and give some of them on our business. After that, we will have a Q&A session. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. Now, let us go through the four quarters 2024 financial results. The Q4 revenue was $26.35 billion, down 3%, compared to the quarters. This outcome, by and large, aligns with our expectations and the seasonality. The Q4 gross margin stood at 48. 3%, a 1% point decrease over quarter. The decline in margins in the margins is 0.3%, and the decline in the gross margin was 0. 3%. 3%. The Q4.

In the previous quarter, 12. 7% of industry revenue was roughly below average. Q4's revenue was 762 million, with the METO ratio falling by 2.8 billion, but the growth in the previous quarter also slightly increased as the government increased its funds. Q4's total revenue was 3.4 billion, or 12.9% of profits. As a result, Q4's EPR was 6. 63%.

This part is provided by the Trump administration's political fear. Otherwise, the production level of RailTech will remain healthy on the middle course. This will end the 24th year of RailTech's fourth quarter. While there are a few days of work in the first quarter of 2025, this New Year's holiday is still good, as our expectations during the New Year are 11.7 billion of our monthly expectations.

Looking ahead, we believe that RailTech will continue to grow in 2025 due to the fixed demand of our customers and the expected upgrade and growth of the market. Now we are going to talk about the main expectations of RailTech. First, we see that the expectations of the PC and non-PCs are 31296 during the Q424 period. Then, in 2025, the team has also had a very significant impact on Corp drafts, and we expect that Tenji market traffic will increase this year or the end of next year, so many traffic software, Wi-Fi routers and Tenji Palms will become more promising.

This trend may continue through the first quarter of 2025. Regardless of whether or not the study of recent political factors, the market is undergoing rigorous reforms and converting to multi-level software as far as possible. For example, a 5G cable wireless software conversion will become the best choice for Wi-Fi 7 routers that are essential. As for traffic software conversion, RealTech still has enough room for growth, the transportation software market in the near-term and medium-term, as well as the long-term digital center market. On Wi-Fi, while during the fall in the quarter of mid-April, RealTech Wi-Fi ended in 2024, but in the quarter of mid-April, it remains the strongest growth region.

By 2025, we expect the computer and computer industry to continue to perform Wi-Fi growth. Under very new expectations, the Wi-Fi 7 execution rate reached 4% in each market report in 2024 and is expected to grow to 25%. These expectations are consistent with the Wi-Fi 7 executions in our observations in the PC and router markets. At the same time, more Wi-Fi devices will expect to remain in the main execution in the market by 2025, performing important enforcement rights that the real Wi-Fi industry will maintain under the advancement of Wi-Fi 7. In the audio library, according to IDC, the total PC market is expected to reach 4.3% in 2025, due to the support of Windows 10, and the PC used is restricted.

Therefore, on Wi-Fi's execution rate, Wi-Fi's execution rate is the highest. Therefore, on Wi-Fi's execution rate, Wi-Fi's execution rate is the highest. Therefore, on Wi-Fi's execution rate, Wi-Fi's execution rate is the highest. Therefore, on Wi-Fi's execution rate, Wi-Fi's execution rate is the highest.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcripts provided by the user and organize them into paragraphs. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any of the original text, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragment provided to see if there are obvious errors or formatting issues. For example, timestamps are correct, whether there are duplicates or missing parts. Note that there is an interval between some timestamps, such as [502. 12-503. 12] and then jump directly to [503. 12-504. 12], where there is no interval, which may mean that the content is continuous.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete, such as "[509. 12-510. 12] '" and "[511. 12-512. 12] '", which may need to be combined with contextual processing. Next, I need to group sentences by logic. For example, about the portion of Wi-Fi execution rate, it may be necessary to merge into a paragraph.

These may be speech recognition errors, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep it as it is. It may be necessary to keep it as it is, or adjust it slightly without affecting understanding, but the user explicitly requests not to be rewritten, so it can only be retained. When handling the Q&A section, it is necessary to identify the conversation between the questioner and the answerer and appropriate segmentation.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that each sentence is arranged in chronological order, but the timestamps in the verbs provided by the user may not be continuous and need to be checked. Finally, check whether the entire paragraph is smooth, whether there are missing or duplicate sentences. Make sure that all the contents are converted correctly without missing any sentences. At the same time, maintain the natural transition between paragraphs, use the appropriate punctuation marks and junctions, but the user requests do not change, so only the punctuation and verbs in the original text can be used.

In summary, the steps include: examining and understanding user needs, identifying content structures, dealing with possible errors or non-standard words, grouping sentences by logic, ensuring that all content is retained, and last reading checks coherence and integrity. </think> The following is a paragraph-based verb (fully retaining all original content, adjusting only the punctuation and paragraph structure): -- Wi-Fi has the highest execution rate. Therefore, tangible Ю mel in Wi-Fi is the highest execution rate.

And lastly, AutoEthernet. While the world's Automarket is growing in consumption, we expect RealTech's AutoEthernet production to continue to grow nationwide in the automotive industry and in RealTech. The expansion is driven by two main factors: first, the increase in the car makes Ethernet's transportation successful; second, the further use of Ethernet, Ethernet's vehicle uses more and more Ethernet's solutions.

Azhi, now we start to ask a bigger question: Which part of the stock market car will be the company's growth? We can see that today's truck transport is expected to grow during 2025 due to the growth in the network world and the growth in the local network car and truck transport in the car Ethernet growth will be more affected by the car's growth in the car, and the car's transportation background is for Auto Ethernet growth. Can you comment on the performance of the stock market growth in 2025?

Realtax's challenge has been complex. We are confident that our ability to make these changes more effective this year swept to exhaustion GDP high platax, which is also the reason why Pers Tensant has a few overall situas This is for thinking like what we're going to do with his E vir vir, but Opac menstrual pm, in fact, you're a bitte in health cost growth, and over the long term, our strategy remains focused on increasing industry averages since increasing the industry average.

We hope that we can wait for the final part to more accurately reach the market's growth projects. How do we think that this year's Wi-Fi is expected to improve? Do you see any better upgrades to Wi-Fi 6 and 7? The year 2025 is expected to be the second quarter of Wi-Fi 7, while the year 7 is the third quarter of Wi-Fi 6. We hope that we will be expected on the market to be between Wi-Fi 4 Wi-Fi 6E, and then 5% of these figures may not indicate market expectations, and they also say that Wi-Fi 7 does not meet the market's expectations in real-world applications.

In today's market, it is likely that different versions of Wi-Fi will continue to hold each other for some time. We will look at two important Wi-Fi special options lines and computers. --- **Note**: 1. Retain all original content (including duplicated, suspected voice recognition errors, "vehicle", "st komma", "tangible Ю mel", etc.) 2. Adjust only the punctuation and paragraph separators, without modifying any original content. 3. The Q&A section is based on dialogue logic, but does not alter the original order or content. 4. The timestamp has been removed, in paragraph format that meets the user's requirements.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [1247. 30-1253. 30] The AI clones, motorcycles, sensors, and battery managers are all misunderstood as the main part, rather than the important elements. [1253. 30-1262. 30] These elements must be connected to each other and operate in each other's operation.

In addition, only the same AI needs to use artificial intelligence that can be used. [1262. 30-1268. 30] Artificial intelligence interacts with television and audio, so that this perspective is playing a real and honest role in the operation of the computer. [1268. 30-1276. 30] As well as artificial intelligence, we will make more updates and updates under such appropriate prevention. [1276. 30-1284. 30] We will update and use the operating organization under this prevention, especially one of the world's largest artificial intelligence. [1284. 30-1291. 30] An artificial intelligence is able to operate very prominent computer updates and use computer operations. [1291. 30-1298. 30]
