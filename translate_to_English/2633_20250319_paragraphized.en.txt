Welcome to participate in the Taiwan High Speed Rail Online Investor Conference. Today, there are Vice President of Taiwan High Speed Rail, Weiren Wang, and Manager Yuan Zhiqiang of Finance Department. Next, the official start of the conference, I will pass the time to the Vice President of Weiren Wang.

This time we made a operational report for the fourth quarter of 2024. Just like we split our business, finance, and then there are other operational outputs. The first part of our business we asked Fang to explain.

On the fifth page of the half-month briefing, the length of his entire high-speed rail line is the same as that of the fleet and the number of stations, which remains the same in the same scale. The number of weekly schedules was increased after July 1, 2024 to 1103, and so far remains the same. However, during a continuous holiday or some special holiday-specific events, the high-speed rail company will also increase the supply of energy or implement a plan for a short-term increase in demand for passengers.

From March 14th to March 30th, the high-speed rail company also planned a short-term increase of 57 shifts to respond to an early return to the country. Below the regular schedule, we are currently improving a service supply for a particular period through an irregular overtime car and a short-term increase in short-term. The next briefing page 6 is the growth of a capacity supply for each quarter in 2024. The total number of operational trains for the whole year in 2024 opened a total of 57729 shifts, which provided a total of 186 1.4 million km.

In the fourth quarter, the growth rate of the fourth quarter was 4.6%, the fourth quarter's 14562 departures, and the surrounding 4.7 billion kilometers, which was a year-round energy supply to the high. The fourth quarter's annual growth rate was 4.6%, and the fourth quarter's annual growth rate was 4.5%. For the next seven pages, 7825 million visitors in 2024 was the highest record since 2007, when the number of high-shoes increased nearly 520 million people and the annual growth rate was 7.1%.

In terms of daily average traffic, the average daily traffic in each quarter of 2024 accounted for 200,000 times, and the average daily traffic in the 24th quarter reached a quarter of 21.80 million times higher. That reflected the operating utilisation rate, which reflected that in terms of operating utilisation, the operating utilisation rate in the 24th quarter was more than 70%, but we have a slightly lower operating utilisation rate than in the 4th quarter of 23rd quarter through a regular schedule and a short-term commitment of a measure to improve the performance of the 24th quarter of 73. 4%.

Next, we asked the Finance Manager, Mr. Tian Zhiqiangyuan, to explain the financial performance of the investment industry in advance.

First of all, let's take a look at page 10, which is a comparison of the 2024 on the right hand side of the table compared to 2023. In fact, we can see clearly from the comparison that 2024 is actually a growth in 2023, both in terms of gross profit and the operating economy. The interest cost is slightly lower compared to 2023, mainly because there is a slight decrease in the interest rate, which is a slight increase in the interest rate compared to 2023.

That's why we have a one-off interest reduction in 2023, which resulted in an increase in profits in 2023, so the more stable quota fees are listed. That 2024 does not normally follow the normal profit to be listed, that 2024 does not normally follow the normal profit to be listed, so the smooth quota will be less than 2023.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim text provided by the user in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

You need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical part, such as about the EBITDA part, or about the cash flow part. At the same time, pay attention to the order of the timestamps to ensure that the structure of the paragraphs conforms to the original speech process. During the process, you may encounter some duplicate or redundant information, such as several mentions of EBITDA margin, which needs to be kept as it were, not deleted.

In addition, the phrase "paraphrasing" mentioned by the user may mean the combination of the relevant sentences into a more natural paragraph, but the principle of non-modified content must be strictly followed. It is also necessary to pay attention to the use of punctuation marks and the words to make the paragraphs smoother, but the same can not change the original intention. For example, to merge duplicate sentences into the same paragraph, use appropriate verbs such as "in addition", "at the same time", etc., but must ensure that these verbs are present in the user's original text, or by natural sentences. Finally, I will read the paragraphs after finishing the paragraphs, check whether all sentences are properly preserved, without omissions or errors.

This generates paragraph-by-word transcription that matches the user's needs. </think> [paragraph-by-text transcription]: After that, net profit after the income and expense items. It has fallen by about 1.3 billion compared to 2023. It has fallen by about 1.3 billion compared to 2023. It has fallen by about 1.3 billion compared to 2023. It has fallen by about 1.3 billion compared to 2023.

The EBITDA section is about $359 billion, compared to 2023, which is about $1.7 billion. I think you can see the picture below, in fact, after the outbreak, our operations resumed normal and revenues gradually increased every year, so EBITDA actually followed the growth. Like us in 2024, EBITDA is about $36 billion, basically in recent years the new high. That is in EBITDA margin, which is the part of the revenue growth, of course, that is, in recent years, because of the impact of the entire inflation, resulting in some procurement costs of some of our repair materials, and the increase in those electricity costs, then the way that is our personnel ban, and the staff will increase in the number of people growth, so you can see that we in the EBITDA margin in 2023 will be about 68%.

In fact, even if the high-speed rail company up to 2024, our revenue can be divided into two parts, the first is the railway transport ticket revenue, which accounts for the majority of our revenue, which accounted for 96.4% in 2024, and the other is an affiliate business revenue, which accounted for 3.6%. We can see below the chart below that we see that the portion of the railway transport ticket revenue in 2024 is 11.5 percent higher than in 2023, and the portion of the revenue of the affiliated business is 11.5% higher than in 2023, and the combined growth of our overall growth is 6.8%.

This is mainly due to the net cash outflow of the investment activities, and some of our investment activities, including our fixed-rate RB more than three months of the situation is mainly caused, the capital expenditure last year was about 8 billion yuan, the main capital expenditure is the train's new train expenditure about 4.5 billion, then the main part of the investment activities is the cash out, mainly because we in 2024 we reduced the issuance of our original business books, we have reduced the 1.57.5 billion yuan, the company at the same time to maturity 500 billion, and then the issuance of cash incentive 57.4 billion yuan, resulting in the net cash out of more than 200 billion. Therefore, the overall, when the monthly cash down is 132 billion yuan, the above with all reports.

The market value of the part is because our stock price is still stable in recent years, so the market value of this market is not very small, which you can see on the map for reference. Next, let's report that our future high-speed rail company in operation as a high-speed rail operator in fact, in fact, we will improve the traffic rate of our all aspects of our operation to improve the customer's source of the greatest effort, so...

Here's a paragraph-by-text transcript following a re-routing:. Improve our departure time. Evacuation of passengers. This way, not only increases the ride comfort, but also expands the source of our passengers. That night cooperation is also a part of our ongoing promotion, so it's a strategy for us through travel products, such as high-speed travel hotel tickets for international airline tickets. This strategy continues to be optimized every year.

In recent years, we have been focusing on a member economy. In fact, so far, we have already had a membership of 2.9 million members. The number of members continues to be accumulated. This part of our hope is that in the member economy, we can increase the economic effect of members in addition to the condensation.

We hope that this will increase the revenue of some of our other goods. Then, of course, we will increase the satisfaction of our customers by increasing the satisfaction of their service. So we will continue to continue to see if there are high-speed rail, we should continue to update our display information on the train equipment, and hope that these important measures are also in response to the implementation of our ESG concept. So we can see this section on page 18, the high-speed rail company is a green rhyme, basically we do not rely on the so-called railway transport industry, we hope that we can provide safe and accurate services in the field of rail transportation, and we can also use this rail industry, so that every user can experience more quality and local culture.

These are some of the awards that we have received in ESG. These awards are for your reference only and are a testament to the efforts of the high-speed rail company in this regard. Of course, this is a goal that we will continue to work on. Thanks for the above report, thank you.

OK. I think we will try our best to do some reports according to what we know. There is a general outlook for 2025 here. Are you saying that 2025 is the whole business, including services? Yes. In 25 years, our estimates will certainly be slightly higher than 2024.

However, since we were in 2025, because we were increasing our current class by 2025. In fact, we ended up with a limited number of 34 trains. We are now gradually, whether it is fixed or temporary, to relieve the congestion of the infusion system. So it looks like we are still growing a little in 2025. But we should be able to grow if we don't have a new car to come in.

Which part of the investor wants to know, the former legal person if you just want to know more about the problem, and then leave a text message. There is another problem here is to ask. At present, we do not have a plan to increase the price? How much will the adjustment of the electricity price this year affect the overall revenue? The price has been the issue, whether the traveler is very concerned or the investor is very concerned, we are also concerned.

There is no final decision. If there is a plan, we will send tax first, and then we will send it to the Ministry of Transportation. The current is still in the internal assessment. The growth of electricity prices is indeed, that is, the growth of electricity prices we are the big user of electricity, so we will definitely increase the cost, directly compress our profits. So this part is also one of the important reasons we have been doing the program. Above, thank you. Is there a chance for gross profit this year to be close to 45%?

We may not be good enough to make an estimate, but because you look at us last year was 44, then if something else is not the same, if the price is still adjusted, what is the price of the electricity, 10 or 6 percent is not? I remember that the media is 6%. If 6% of my cost increases by 6%, then other inflation factors, this is probably known. So we also hope to be fast, but whether the revenue is good or gross profit is also able to increase. But of course, there is a big project to overcome.

The above. Lead the electric budget visuals, some slime no problem, but we have a good screen, can use one. The future encouragement policy encourages us to remain unchanged, written in the charter is that the distribution of surplus is not less than 60, we are the distribution of more than 61 points, 61 points, and then $1.05 per share, it should have been the same in the past.

That's all. Do you have any questions? Is there a plan to buy a car in the future for the company? If you buy a car, we have a 12 train that is just the same as our 17th day, and we have a supplement contract.

I think investors should know that in the future, we will still be the relationship between our luck and power, and we are going to take this car for granted. Our purchase is in 2022 and we'll explain it later.

This 12-column new car will be delivered in 2026, and then joined our train operations in 27 years. This martask.,-----If Mr. does not have any other questions, is there anything else the company needs to supplement? We have no, thank you.

Thank you to the management team who attended today, and thank you for your continued investment.
