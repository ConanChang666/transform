We hope that you will be able to ask any questions you have until the end of the report. This is why ESC has been providing this information in accordance with the government's requirements. We have also set up the Agricultural Elite Committee to be able to do our best as a member of the ESC community. In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of new technologies and special applications. In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of new technologies and special applications. In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of new technologies and special applications. In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of new products and services. In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of new products and services. This is our technology organization We are very emphasizing that we are using technology to lead the company's development I myself also involved in the development of these technologies every week We are also involved in the development of these technologies. We are very important to emphasize that our company is different from other substrate manufacturers. We have a global layout so that we can get all kinds of industries in Europe, the United States different applications and then need to provide them with future solutions. The second reason is that we can do so because we have a lot of technology that we have to offer them in the future solutions.

This is why we get a lot of national defense and aerospace certification, accounting for about 8% of our revenue, but the profit accounting for about 3, 4, because it is very high, because we want to do, okay, talk about our strategy, because we want to emphasize that we do special materials, and then because these things are not too much, so we are training with equipment transformation, or buying is a small amount, and then we have to avoid this training, with some large, almost all the market are large manufacturers to compete.

In fact, in the electric vehicle industry, it also has a laser radar, it also has a variety of, some IOT, all of these things can be used, so you can see that although we have a little decline in profits, then the revenue has declined a lot, three years in a row, but we think that after the adjustment in the past three years, we have seen a lot of opportunities for certification in the past, and then a lot of the same price together, in the next year, it is slowly stopped. Then, because of the development of AI, you can see that it will slowly expand, like unmanned, these applications robots like AR VR, these drones will get hoter, so I think there will be a lot of military space investment, so this future is possible.

This site is particularly emphasizing that the ultra-high technology market, the first one is the military aerial and semiconductor testing, which is the expenditure we see, but recently because the U.S. and Ukraine, Russia this negotiations, you may have seen eye rash, but for the EU, especially for the world, they are planning to build their own army, especially like Germany said to invest â‚¬20 billion, to build their own production base, so its top ten military manufacturers, Nigeria is trying to find their own work, build his own industry, and then help the EU, or to build his own inventory. This part of the reason is because these militarymen are very conservative, the growth, in fact, because the military costs are very slow, why, and now we see, like the rocket accelerators, or some of our industry's, they started out of the two years, because it is very high.

After removing it, it is a rice plate. In the past, it was still not able to affect the test of it. We think this board is very expensive, but relative to a GPU, it may be drizzling rain.

But he threw it off. He threw it off. So the artillery was also very heavy. It used to be plastic engineering. Now he can't meet the needs of GPU testing. This is also a big amount.

We believe that we may be fermented again this year. Because GB200 is not real. Mass production is still a strategic problem. In the third quarter of the year, we can see that the system will grow significantly.

We're all looking forward to it. That's why we're getting older on the PI. These are the main applications we're currently using. In fact, space aviation has been adding a few more recently. For example, we're talking about a man-made taxi.

We have not been able to do this, nor have we been able to do it, but we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it, and we have been able to do it."

The opportunity to include the probe board is going to be very big in the future. There are still many drones. Jobby and Nidec are all there. Then the oil carbon beach. In fact, the oil carbon beach.

That's why we do the drill on the ground. Then we put it there. That's a very large amount. Now the United States is starting to say oil carbon. Then we replace some green energy.

This is what we see as a future trend. It is what we use to use this material. This material is especially special, and it is recognized by Raytheon as one of us. It does a lot of heat dissipation, then it can fill its multi-layer board.

In fact, it is not easy to replace the material. There are now dozens of items. Then Maori is in seventy percent. So our products are one-click. Constantly increasing. Add the type of investment.

We have a 462SH code six. The six-level material in the middle. No glue PP sheet. It is also now imported into the multi-layers next to the military.

It's also used. Now I have my terminal. Take me this material to evaluate the use of it. Some of NVIDIA's editing test boards are above. That's the main reason.

It has a lot of filler requirements. I also want to flatten. I want to tell you, right now, these requirements. Bring no standard products. It's going to be everywhere to look for different things.

To provide the solution. Then we also mentioned. Market share groups. Then these were some aerial photography presidents. The top ten came from the engine to the instructor. That's right, the Lockwell companies.

"We want to be able to do that," he said, "and we want to be able to do that for years to come.

We should say so. We should say. We think our company has. There are four key technologies. So we can meet the future development of our customers.

The future needs of end customers. The first one we have is very strong in the technology of thermal management. We now offer the product of thermal conductivity. It can be up to 100,000. It is already with the highest level of Japan, like Lichang or Denka.

These companies have the same level of production cost, and it's only a big one, so we've got a lot of cases right now. It's heat management technology.

In addition, we have very accurate. Breakthrough technology. Horizontal vertical breakthrough technology. Then we put values on it because we make our own non-vacuum glue. Or high ultra-high flow glue.

It's too close, we think we have this advantage, so these technologies are right, this is the combination of these technologies.

The two of them may be related to each other, or they may be related to each other, or they may be related to each other, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another, or they may be related to one another.

The project is in progress. And it's all the more interrupted. That's what we're talking about. We're heat management. We're now on the road to 4B. Now we're quitting 4BD.

These are the ones who have gone astray, who have gone astray, who have strayed from the right path, who have strayed from the right path, who have strayed from the right path, who have strayed from the right path, and who have strayed from the right path, and who have strayed from the right path.

And they said unto him, Behold, he is come unto thee, and he is come unto us, and he is come unto us, saith the Lord.

There are a lot of companies in Europe. There are many companies in Europe. There are many companies in Europe.

We expect it to start at the end of next year, and this will be the beginning of the year.

Plus, my main product is a joint. It accounts for 4% of our revenue. But the profit should account for 10%. That's a 20% increase this year. That's a new development.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them to paragraph transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the transcription content provided. It looks like a lecture on material science or electronic manufacturing, involving film, thermal solutions, production techniques, etc. There are many technical terms and terminology in the content, such as "glass cloth", "AR glasses",", "epoxy capacitors", etc., need to correctly identify and retain these terms.

For example, the first sentence is "[1291 00-1292.00] instead of this one", which may look wrong or incomplete, but according to the user's request, the original sentence must be kept and cannot be modified. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the original in the collation. Next, I need to group these sentences according to the logical relationship, forming paragraphs. For example, with regard to the comparison of traditional glass base materials and new pure glue material, it may be necessary to merge them into a paragraph.

It is important to note that some sentences may not be grammatically or structurally incomplete, such as [1301. 00-1302. 00] or say, which may be combined with context to determine whether a paragraph belongs to the same paragraph. Also, the number in the timestamp may represent the point of time, but the user requests not to delete anything, so the timestamp also needs to be retained, but the user's example does not show the timestamp, it may be necessary to confirm whether it is included in the final output.

In addition, users must ensure that all sentences are included, even if some sentences appear to be duplicated or incomplete. For example, "[1377. 00-1378. 00]] Good" is short, but must be retained. Finally, check for missing sentences or formatting errors, make sure that each original sentence is properly converted, and paragraph division is reasonable. At the same time, maintain the correctness of professional terminology to avoid misunderstandings due to paragraphs.

This is not a traditional piece of glass cloth, but a small piece of robotic application above these small things, it has heat dissipation high-frequency high-frequency solutions. So we developed this pure gel surface, this sticker can also be non-thin, so we have joined the production of these applications. This may not be the mainstream, but it has been used, and the profit is very good, this is a field that our competitors have not done, because it is very complex, so we do not have to do complicated habits, so it is not a problem.

Well, we can design the material in any size, so we can design it in small plastic equipment, and then we have to control a lot of small plastic equipment, then it has a lot of requirements in small and flexible production, so the technical threshold is also high. Then because we have been designing our concept for many years, and then use this method to sell to serve, do our top, in the trainer, so we have to fill the plastic in the back of the semiconductor, not only some ceramics, reduce the interference of electricity, and can get the heat out of the capacitance, like we are working with a world's largest capacitance, then we provide black film to give it to the ball capacitance flatten, shield, everyone see the ball capacitance in a bucket now turn it into flat, the amount of their equipment has been tested for a year, and they have started to promote outside, especially his customers like the largest mobile phones, the largest electric electric car customers, hoping they want to do it to do the amount from this year from the next year to the two million. This is the future of our company, and we will find that it will grow greatly in the future, and very technical threshold, and very high gross profit, and very flexible production, these are a future may have a lot to go with us, and then this black film gives you to see is a flat, if the slice is buried inside, in fact, it's not good to say that he has more than one piece of a piece and then buried it in it, and then the equipment he went to invest in, and then the verification finally to mass production, I think this is probably this is the second or third time this year or after the third quarter of the largest case, this application museum with a large electric store, so our materials let him do multi-layer in a heavy machine, industrial controller he used above, this, this is actually started to mass mass production, we think it is more and more and more than that it is a lot of the same.

Here is the re-routing paragraph type transcription: Because few people can replace the first ProBond technology, our technology is difficult, the second picture is difficult, thinner and more difficult, and then there is a problem to solve its direction, and then there is the problem, these are our huge advantages. Then it is said that the camera's anti-shock, they found that we can replace the previous thing, because it is thinner and smaller, so that they can do the machine thinner on the anti-shock, many like ceramics, it is this one that is Cut the Cone, is heat dissipation, and then buy the power semiconductor to buy into this, I just mentioned that is about 10% less cost, so in the future solution above, there are really four international manufacturers, IC companies, anyway, many B companies, are in line with this technology.

In addition, we should also mention here that we have recently won a case, that is, laser radar, that laser radar also uses a 10-layer plate, so we bought our four and five such materials to do the pressure shaft, and then make it can be cool and can do the laser distance, which in the car above this application you can imagine, it is very large, so we actually have a hundred and sixty such cases on the film, we have a lot of orders, and have been increasing. Maybe last year is our year, to push this material, actually because of the market recognition not much, but fast, we found that this AI in development, or a lot of industrial applications to the development of everyone has to go to the extreme, the material has to break, or there are no other solutions, and we can provide a lot of this kind of thermal efficiency, and so we should feel that it is now this time, a lot of the next time it is the next time, we are the next time to provide a lot of the market with a lot of the new radar. In the media at the moment, but we can provide stable, and we think of our processing technology, because we make it to the package level of clothing technology, so the opportunity should be better than others, that's the sky I just mentioned, is the radar, this is our traditional certification and look at you, is the raw material has been rising, began to rise, the glass cloth and copper foil copper foil yesterday did not know yesterday to 9700, today we all quote the basis is still developing, now there may be a month or two months in stock, three months to raise prices, and after the end of the month, we are forced to raise prices, so this provides everyone a trend.

This is why we also provide this Supply Chain service. The proportion of this part is actually gradually increased. The other blue color plus orange gray this piece, and the current proportion is about 4 percent.

Our general material, that is, there is currently no price competitive part. That part of Q4, because we just announced our annual report yesterday, that part of Q4 can see that we have a slight increase in revenue compared to Q3, a slight decline. That is mainly two reasons: because Q4's product Mix is poor, and then Q4's China has a policy adjustment, which leads to the fact that we have some increase in cost, so this affects our gross profit margin of Q4.

But we have made an emergency situation in December, so we start this year, although it will have, but it will not have the effect to say that Q4 accounted for $0.% of the size. That is, of course, a lot of relevant, because now a change in the environment, we are ready to adapt. The operating fee rate is 27%, the entire absolute value is also higher than Q3, mainly because there are some invoices because there is no instant bill entry, so we made it a full complement in Q4 at the end of that year.

It is also the case that there are some income outside the industry, because the exchange rate or some interest rate, which is our usual income. Let's take a look at the part of the balance sheet, which is quite stable. That is, basically, we now have relatively low working capital. The balance of all kinds of relevant business important financial indicators, the maintenance is more normal.

But the entire credit risk is not raised, and the number of days the customer has received is not increased, and there is no increase in the number of receipts. That time, our share rate, because yesterday we passed the board of directors, we will pay 3.35, in fact, it is the same as 2023, it is the same. The equity rate reached more than 4 points, and then the distribution rate is 7 percent.
