So I would like to say thank you very much to all of you hard work. Thank you very much. Thank you. We have also achieved a lot of success in growth in the last eight years. Judging from the Sciences and Water Resources Analysis, we have achieved growth in both management and products.

Our business succeeds in Asia. 5% of age. The largest contributor to age growth. Is the time market. Of course due to the purchase of Taba. We were in mid 2024.

Export business in South Korea, Taiwan, and South Asia is our strongest growth profile. In 2024 we have seen growth in 2024, and we have seen growth in 2024, so we have seen growth in 2028, so in 2028, we have done this in the previous meeting, we did not expect the decline in Buprenorphine and Naroxone, especially in Delmins, because it is a rather high-priced product, so we have a lot of sales and growth, of course at the high-priced Buprenorphine and Naroxone. In 2024, we published a total of 21 SQ in the export markets in 2021, and in the US market, and in the expectation of growth, so we have seen growth in 2024, so we have seen growth in 2028, so we have done in 2028, we have done in 2028, we will do it in 2028, we will do it in a new product, a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product in 2014, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product in 2014, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have passed passed passed a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product in 2014, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product released in 2014, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have This is an obvious answer, India is the world's best pharmaceutical industry, especially in the medical development and medical development, we need to focus more on India's more focus on more details products with our interest, in the areas of rich development, medical development, medical development, medical development, challenging IP, we do find that we need more skills, more resources, so we decided to develop this design center in India development, it is located in Heidelberg, this place is considered the best design center in India, in some places, in 18 countries, there are more than 200 companies, some international, for example, multi-country, for example, for example, multi-country, our design center has about 20,000 square meters, in 15 regional centers, there are some most reliable names, so I really believe that with this step, we will get better efficiency, because we will be lucky luck, because we will make it, because we will contribute in history, so we will contribute to resources, we will be in the resources, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be launched in the future, we are, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we are, we will be in the best resources, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we are, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, this is the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we will be in the future, we are the future, we will be the future, we are the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we are the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we will be in the future, we will be the future, we will be the future, we are, we are IGA is the first treatment for IGA, and the first treatment for IGA.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I will analyze the verbatim provided by the verbatim. Note that each sentence has a timestamp, such as [898. 82-901. 82], which may indicate the start time of the sentence in the recording.

First, I need to identify which sentences are logically in the same paragraph. For example, the settings section about Europe and the United States may belong to the same paragraph, followed by the parts about approval, then about maintaining business relationships, etc. It is necessary to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are coherent, while maintaining the order and content of the original sentences. During the process, you may encounter duplicate or redundant sentences such as "settings in the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, New Zealand and Australia" and "settings in Australia."

In addition, note that some possible spelling or syntax errors, such as "silver oxide glue" may be repeated, but the user requests not to be modified, so it is necessary to keep the same as it is. Similarly, repeating such a "joint company" also needs to be retained. When organizing paragraphs, it is necessary to ensure that each paragraph has a clear theme, such as approval situation, business relationship, joint venture cooperation, currency execution, etc.

Finally, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all the sentences provided are correctly classified into the appropriate paragraphs. Once the initial draft is completed, read it again, confirm that there are no omissions or errors, all content is preserved accurately and the transition between paragraphs is natural. </think> The following is a compiled paragraph-by-phrase transcription (fully retains all the original sentences, only adjusts the punctuation and paragraph structure): --- We will also configure the European Bozutinib, Aphatilib and Quadribil, as well as Ninternib and Sovgel in the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, New Zealand and Australia.

We also have approved the approval of the UK's oxide glue, as well as several U.S. countries in the U.S. and Europe. We have also approved the approval of the oxide glue in the UK, New Zealand, Israel, and the European market, which was, of course, approved on the European market, with the approval of Python in 2025. In addition, our main products have been approved on Ninternib for five years, and we have also been approved on the U.S. and U.S. oxide glue approvals.

As a result, we have held a company that maintains our business operations in Asia. I think that, in the sense of our hiring and hiring, we have very strong control over our actions in the Asian market, and we also think that our hiring people have a great opportunity, and we also have the opportunity to use existing products to grow, as well as to increase the production of new products.

We believe that in many ways, this is part of the growth and growth of the joint company. Especially now, we are working on the joint company's currency. Therefore, we hope that on the joint company's currency, we will have more confidence, we will be more confident, we will be able to decide on their own currency, not only on the joint company's currency, but also on BD.

Our currency execution is really a good year for us. We have many joint company currency checks, GMP checks, many manufacturers, and our CROs in India, which are good results. Including US FDA, as well as Korea companies, Taiwan companies, Alvisa companies, these are all Brazilian companies.

I would also like to remind you that we completed the design of Cialis for a short period of time. We were originally transferring to Cialis in Taiwan in a short period of time. We were also releasing more economic APIs. We did this, and we succeeded in large-scale growth, and our production costs have also increased. Finally, we also achieved a cost of $5.20 billion, and our currency costs have also exceeded $24 billion. We also made great progress in terms of productivity, our MCCI ACG rates from B3B to A3, which is actually our execution plan.

Regarding our business knowledge, we are the best company in HRH for our business knowledge after 3 years. We are also awarded as WinkedIn's Multi-Media Champion, as well as Taiwan's 2024 Media Champion and Anders Utman's Crystal Vinyl. These awards show us...

About sixty eight percent of Taiwan's revenue now comes from brand products such as CLS, Cluster, Linta and so on, while the generics are made about the remaining one third of the revenue. Our brand portfolio grows approximately zero points three percent, and the main reason is that there is the price. Erosion on Linta offsetting growth in other segments, including the growth in a cluster of processes and the Zip, Zelka, which is the new generation of new chemical entities in a small cell lung cancer. And our Asian Southeast clusters deliver approximately one billion in revenue in twenty four, increased from only two hundred and seventy percent.

The third product is a product about life. It is a new product and it is a daily product. It is a treatment for recovering virus.

Recovery virus is a product that relates to offline diseases. So I think that this product is a very new product and it is a real product. **Section two**. So this product may be needed for recovery virus, about wearing a mirror or treatment. Our partners in the United States have released this product, and of course, this product is based on successful PACE3 data. They are looking forward to the public launch and launch of the product later this year.

We look forward to bringing this product to Asia, and we are also discussing it, so we can end this agreement within a few weeks. The three products together may produce an annual income in Asia, based on the $6 billion we forecast. It is amazing. **The fourth paragraph**. Of course, we have a lot more discussion about the launch of the product.

Our goal is to continue to roll out the new wheel of Renzel Automite, which is our highest product, from the perspective of internal development and manufacturing. We are also preparing, and we are also going to roll out Ninted Nib in the European market in Asia. **The fifth paragraph**. We will be rolling out this year in Canada. In Asia, we believe that our main goal for the launch is Alpha Choice, and I have mentioned that we already have all the product equipment.

**Section six**. We will have implemented the implementation through the US security enforcement enforcement within the first year of this year. I can report that we are now actually launching in the US in the first quarter, and in the first quarter of the US, we will develop products designed with Lotus. **Section seven**. So, we expect $2.5 billion in annual revenue, and we expect that there are other releases that I have already mentioned, about $5.8 billion in annual revenue. Of course, this will be the biggest, of course, and this will be the biggest M&A opportunity.

We are doing a successful transaction in Southeast Asia, we are ordering in April, so this transaction starts yesterday, starting yesterday, starting at the end of 24, starting at the end of 24. ** Paragraph 9**. Basically, this is a transaction that is a budget purchase, so I think it is a good industry, it will strengthen our position in our main market, in Southeast Asia, we are entering 2025 financial goals, we will budget 2025 financial goals, we will budget 2025 financial goals, 2024 financial goals in the tenth paragraph ** The total budget is 18.600 million, the total budget is 18.600 million, the total budget is 18.60 million, the financial goals of 2025 years, we will budget is 2025 billion, we will be 2025 billion, the budget is 2025 billion, this represents 7-10 billion, 20 billion, in the west, we expect 20% growth, we expect to grow, this will be the main market in South Korea, this will be the main market, this will be by the major market, and the main market, and the three-three-star markets, and three-star markets, and three-star markets, and three-star markets, and we will continue to come on average, although competition, but the competition.

**Section 11. In 2025, we expect the average continued growth of the Samsung market, and the Samsung market, but **Section 12**. In 2025, we expect the US to grow in the West, we expect the US to grow in the West, we expect 25% of the growth of the spider business, and re-enter the business, he later suggested that I mentioned in the aisia market in which the fijx in the export industry, to promote, in the US market is about to climb, can expect double gold growth in 2025, on Bubra Rufin Naukson, production is still unbalanced, we are basically in the plan to resist the increase in competition, and we believe that this may lead to a floating and quantitative increase in price, compared to 2024. **Section 13**. But Bubra Rufin Naukson is a small contributor to our revenue factor, because the increase in price is already lower, so we want to resist the decline.

We now have about 10% of the purchase budget, our business contract Albogen and our business project calculation, which is good news. ** paragraph 14**. In summary, our resistance to increase the price of the budget is 7-10%, an annual increase in the budget, I think it is a good news, we have a strong foundation to achieve these goals. ** paragraph 15**

For OPEX, we expect a 24% yield, and we expect a 206% yield, and we expect a non-continuous production deposit, including the purchase costs and the income from the investment funds, up to 2024. Of course, this is an announcement that we do not compensate for any possible compensation from ongoing discussions. m&a or product portfolio acquisitions deals, so.

So now we can update our growth catalyst and financial expectations for 2024 and 25 years, so thank you very much, and now we are ready to answer questions.

If you are looking for a place to live, you may be looking for a place to live, but if you are looking for a place to live, you may be looking for a place to live, but if you are looking for a place to live, you may be looking for a place to live, but if you are looking for a place to live, you may be looking for a place to live, but if you are looking for a place to live, you may be looking for a place to live, and if you are looking for something to do, you may be looking for something to do.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I need to check the verbatim content provided. There seems to be a lot of timestamps and corresponding sentences, some are English, some are Chinese, and some may be garbledging due to technical issues such as "disrupt so by the" and "we interf mal" sections.

First of all, I will look at the sentences corresponding to each timestamp and then group them according to the context to form a coherent paragraph. It should be noted that some sentences may fall into the same paragraph, such as a continuous English sentence may belong to the same person's speaking, while the Chinese part may fall into another part. At the same time, the duplicated "a lot of" may need to remain the same, even if it looks duplicated and cannot be deleted. During processing, I will encounter some challenges, such as whether the interval between timestamps means that the person is speaking or whether it is just a pause of the same person. For example, from "so there's nobody effectively" to "so we tried in the last few years with several products on", because they are all about the company's discussion.

In addition, you need to pay attention to the garbled in the Chinese section, such as "disrupt so by the" and "we interf mal", which may need to be kept as it is, but users may want to keep the original format, so you can copy it directly. At the same time, the duplicated "a lot of" appears multiple times, and may need to check whether it belongs to the same person's stress, but all duplicates must be kept. During the processing process, I will ensure that each sentence is arranged in chronological order and that the line breaks apart between paragraphs, but sentences within the same paragraph remain consistent. For example, the English section may be divided into several paragraphs, discussing market strategies, growth goals and payment solutions, while the Chinese section may involve different topics such as M&A projects and payment plans.
