First, I will report my financial situation. First, I will explain the review of the merger in the fourth quarter of 2024. The third quarter of the APP's revenue fell from the third quarter due to seasonal demand changes. The combined revenue in the third quarter was NT$12.3 billion, a decrease of 4% from the third quarter.

Gross profit was $6.50 billion and QQ decreased by 2%. YY increased by 28%. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 53%. QOQ and YY increased by 1 percentage point and 9 percentage points respectively.

The increase in gross profit margin is mainly due to the changes in the portfolio of IoT business units and the increase in revenue of AI business units. The increase in gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was $30 billion, an increase of approximately $220 million compared to the previous quarter.

QOQ increased by 11%. YY increased by 27%. The amount of R&D costs was increased by 2.5% as R&D personnel increased. Facilities with a facility that should be x confidence Ettx property or design. Twitter decreased by 9set for $3500 GQG amount.

Wellwell Spirit really rises. Turns to see the negative and collect the record. Score in September at Leana's goddamn. Go to OhQing abile and drop two percentage points. WiWi should rise upwards to exactly. arbeitt point.

In the fourth quarter, the outside income was 370 million yuan. It was mainly derived from interest income of 100 million yuan. And the net fraction of the exchange interest of 200 million yuan. Of these, 9 of the Company's funds became part of the U.S. dollar. It was mainly funded by GDR.

The US dollar interest rate range is about 4 to 5%. Interest income can be around 90 million to 100 million yuan per quarter. Balance possible exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange interest comes from the fourth quarter. The impact of the US dollar on the TWD exchange rate appreciation of 3. 6%.

Since the Company's GDR funds are funded in addition to R&D investment, there has been no significant fluctuations. In addition to existing foreign currency funds, foreign currencies, such as receivables, will continue to be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.

Changes in the exchange rate of the US Dollar. This is mainly due to the fluctuation in the amount of the book. There is no substantial effect on the company. Excluding GDR-related exchange options. And the calculation of the amount of income tax impact. Will be explained on the next page.

The company currently does not use. Foreign exchange active safe. The main consideration is the US dollar and Taiwan dollar spreads. A portion of the natural safe has been provided. Net profit before the fourth quarter tax is $7,100 million. The income tax fee is $2,100 million.

The effective income tax rate is increased to 29.7%. This includes the company's 2022 annual income tax finalization. The income tax fee is incurred. The amount is about 80 million yuan. Mainly the company and the IRS.

Investment losses caused by the liquidation of subsidiaries. Taxes. The IRD does not preclude the company from claiming investment losses. The company will file administrative remedies in accordance with the procedures. For a reasonable tax ruling, the net profit after tax is 500 million yuan.

QOQ, YY increased by 49% and 36% respectively. Net interest rate was 41%. Earnings per quarter were $30 billion per share per quarter. Excluding exchange profits and losses incurred by GDR for the use of funds. Net income for the ex-industrial sector was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. Mainly derived from interest income of 100 million.

Excluding the impact of GDR-related exchange rates. Net profit in the fourth quarter will be $3.4 billion. QOQ, YY increased by $3.4 billion. QOQ, YY decreased by 26% and 44% respectively.

Net interest rate is 28%. Adjusted earnings per share at $2.08. Full year. Revenue in 2024 were impacted by the competition in the IoT market. A slight decrease of 1% compared to last year.

Gross profit amount is $21.5 billion. Gross profit margin is 51%. Increased by 9 percentage points compared to 42% last year.

Gross profit margin. An increase of 2.5% to 12%. Annual operating expenses of 10,80 billion yuan. An increase of 1.8 billion yuan. The R&D costs of R&D projects increased by about 30%. It is expected to continue in the new product line.

R&D costs continue to grow. Expenses are reduced due to increased fees and revenues. Net operating profit of 10,6 billion yuan. 25% increase compared to the previous year. Net operating interest rate of 25% increased by 5 percentage points. Earnings per share were $9.73 per year.

This page also illustrates the cost of excludeing GDR locations. Net income from outside the industry is $59 billion in 2024. Mainly from interest income of $40 billion and exchange interest of $30 billion.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription of re-routing:. Your earnings per share after this calculation were $7.85, a decrease of $1.08 from $8.93 of 23 years, a decrease of 12% year-on-year. The consolidated support balance sheet portion was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $6.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. Cash and monthly cash were $4.2 billion, measured at a reference cost of $4.7 billion, totaling nearly 70% of the total assets.

Inventory amounted to $1.2 billion, an increase of $830 million from the third quarter, up 7%. Currently, inventory remains at a reasonable degree of 6 to 7 months, and will continue to be dynamically managed according to the status of the order. In addition, the increase in net profit margins and equity-based investments measured by fair value in 2024 is mainly due to the acquisition of 4 million shares by the company at the end of 2023 and the conversion of the company into an investment in equity law at the end of January 2024, resulting in a relative increase in the amount of both subjects.

YY increased by $6 billion compared to the same period last year, with an increase of 5.2%. Net worth per share was $73.34. The above is a description of the financial information. The next time is explained by Mr. Hung Chi-hun, General Manager. The payable amount was reduced by $1.2 billion. A description of the financial information.

The main reason for the increase in AIBUYY is the increase in VHN and Interposer Web Sales. This quarter's gross profit margin increased by 1 percentage point over the previous quarter, as AIBU Licensing increased its revenue share, resulting in an increase in QOQ gross profit margin. Gross profit margin increased by 9 percentage points over the same period last year. In addition to the increase in AIBU revenue, there was a positive impact on IoT sales portfolios.

On this page, light green on the left is a business profit. The fourth quarter's operating profit decreased by 9 percentage points from the previous quarter, mainly because the fourth quarter's revenue was slightly lower than the third quarter, and on this page, the R&D expense in the fourth quarter was increased by 8 percentage points due to the increase in investment in new projects. The operating profit rate was 28%, which decreased by 2 percentage points from the previous quarter.

The overall net profit in the fourth quarter, which was $5 billion, rose significantly from the previous quarter, mainly because of the benefits of the foreign exchange interest mentioned earlier. Net interest rates also rose to 41%. Next, my two business divisions, the situation in the fourth quarter of 2024, explained in advance.

First of all, let's look at IoT, which is a revenue of $9.1 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from the previous quarter, and a decrease of 20% from the YY. This is mainly due to the weak impact of Connectivity compared to the same quarter last year. The main applications of IoT are Connectivity, Wearable, and Video, Audio, and Other. The main applications of Connectivity are cellular networks, 4G 5G Modern, Wi-Fi Bluetooth, and some Industry IoT. Connectivity uses 35% of IoT revenue in this quarter, a decrease of 11% from its previous quarter, and 35% from its revenue in the same quarter last year.

For this market trend change, we have developed some more appropriate solutions to mitigate the impact of Connectivity volatility on our revenues. In addition, for wearables, this quarter amounts to 26% higher than the previous quarter, accounting for 39% of IoT revenues. We have reported to you in advance that wearables have continued to grow in various segments of the market. In addition to wristwatches, AI glasses are also a potential segment.

APS-RAM, our next-generation product, provides the most appropriate solution for these priorities. About APS-RAM will be further explained in a later briefing. APS-RAM already has several customers introducing the next generation of product design, and is expected to contribute to revenue in the second half of this year. With the addition of Wearable Device and the introduction of various new features, especially AI capabilities, it will be both sales and single-machine memory capacity that will increase, bringing a lot of room for growth.

In addition, revenue in Video Audio Others applications decreased by about 14% earlier this quarter, mainly due to seasonal factors. Revenue in this quarter accounted for 26%. This segment was mainly based on revenue from Smartphones and small phones and related applications. Smartphone products are driven by AI and networking applications, and the demand for memory capacity continues to grow. In the market of Display, customers also saw the advantages of IoT RAM, especially APS-RAM.

Several. The new Design is ongoing. We believe Display will be another major application area for IoT RAM.

Also. Fine capacitor. Segon Capacitor. Our trademark is SC-CAP. Separated SC-CAP. We are sold in the form of KGD.

So. We are classified in IoT BU. This year. Our product line classification will make some adjustments. We will explain to you later in the presentation. The separated SC-CAP can be applied in the Subtrait package that embeds HPC products.

Working with several Subtrait industrial suppliers. The related customer projects are also in progress. It is expected that mass production will begin at the beginning of next year. There will also be a number of European and American HPC mainstream customers in the design phase.

In addition, the main driver of the C-CAP application embedded in Subtrait is the need for SIPI for HPC. SIPI refers to the signal quality in the system design. Signal Integrity. SI. and power quality.

Power Integrity PI. SIPI challenges in high-speed systems are growing. So more and more capacitors are needed. It is worth mentioning that the next generation will rely more on capacitors in Subtrait. The reason is that CoreOS L and CoreOS R cannot put a lot of capacitors in Interpose.

It is also a relatively mature family. According to our initial estimates, each Subtrait will have hundreds of capacitors. Market potential is very high. At the same time, the product quality is very high. This is in line with the direction of the company's long-term operation.

Let's take a look at the fourth quarter.

AI division revenue is 3.1.6 billion. It has decreased by 1 billion compared to the previous quarter. This is mainly due to the decrease in web sales compared to the previous quarter. IP licensing has increased revenue as project progress is recognized. It has grown significantly compared to the previous quarter. YY AIVU revenue has increased nearly 10 times.

This is mainly due to the contribution of VHN and Interpose's web sales. The revenue of the AI business is mainly divided into IP licensing VHN and SCCAP Interpose's web sales. Because Interpose is shipped as a weber, we put this part in AIVU.

AIVU's revenues this quarter. Next-generation mining machine VHN shipments are lower than the previous quarter. However, with several projects in SCCAP Interpose entering mass production this quarter, we expect AI to continue the trend in the second half of the year in 2025.

In addition, the VHN of the AI Business Division has already had great customers to discuss with us about the design of the VHN in AI accelerator. A desire to complete one of the projects this year. This will mean that mainstream customers recognize the performance of the VHN of Apep. VHN has officially entered the mainstream application.

This is another highlight. Many U.S. and U.S. customers agree with our product architecture. In addition to several proof-of-concept POC project sequences, we also discuss with our customers the design in above the product. VHN stack products will become another key product line for revenue contribution in the next two years. We are confident of this.

The above is the update for the two divisions in the fourth quarter. Next, I would like to report on the focus of the company's operations and the future outlook for you. In the past five years, the company has invested in IoT and AI two divisions to report results. As the company has now entered the microcapacitor market, in order to give you a clearer understanding of the performance of the microcapacitor product line.

The first is IoT RAM. This is the largest and most mature product line in the world. Operating is the best customized IoT memory in the world. Customer applications, as mentioned above, are mainly connected wearable display, etc. The second is VHM. It also includes VHM stack.

VHM is a very high bandwidth memory. It is a high bandwidth customized DRAM and cryptocurrency for AI HPC. VHM stack is a multi-layered VHM. The application of the customer is AI HPC networking, etc. The third product line is a small capacitance.

We call it IPD. And interposer with small capacitance. We call it IPC. Next, we look forward to the future. The main goal of the IoT product line is to grow revenue. The company proposes new product specifications on the wearable device.

We call it APS RAM. The traditional IoT RAM is mainly connected to the SOC in a threaded way, as shown on the top left. Our new APS RAM specification package is more flexible. It includes the ability to attach the memory directly to the customer's SOC in a freetrip way.

It also significantly improves standby time for wearable devices. It also provides greater bandwidth. Meets the performance requirements of customers. This product is widely supported by customers. There are already a lot of design. We expect to start mass production by the end of this year.

In 2025, there will be a contribution to revenue. In 2026, there will be a contribution to revenue. In addition, the main job of the VHN 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus N plus the VHN stack this part is the adoption of the market application.

Product design, this will be the VHN technology.

IPD is our main application, our design is HPC package substrate, there have been several customers in several substrate plants, gradually completed, validated, and the first batch of mass production is expected to fall this year. In addition, I would also tell the company a new business, after four years of cooperation with a start-up company, the company finally achieved some achievements in the UHF FID tag IC field, product verification basic completion, is expected to begin mass production this year. UHF FID is a fast-growing market, the labeling IC market, the size of about US$450 million, more than 20% growth each year, the company using its own machine technology, can greatly reduce the overall cost of ownership, Total Cost of Ownership, is TCO, we hope to contribute to this field.

Well, I think this is my answer to this question. This year's expected to be better than 2024, in addition to the IoT RAN and VHN have some growth, the main growth momentum, I just mentioned that include the SC-CAP Interposer WaferSource contribution. The next question, please ask the IoT and AI in 25 years of estimated revenue, gross profit range? I just mentioned the three product lines of the company to briefly point out that the IoT RAN is still the majority, the VHN revenue will be maintained between one to two percent, the SC-CAP will also have a 20%, which may not be more accurate estimates, the overall gross profit is almost the same as in 2024, and may have some slight fluctuations as the product portfolio changes will follow, thank you.

The next question, Wafer on Wafer Status, can explain the development progress of U.S. customers and mainland customers, what is the competitive advantage of the APP? I am the product center Liu Zongming, this question I answered, we have begun, belongs to the product design, the opportunity to complete the first project this year, these projects in Europe and the United States, the customer base is mainly to mass production products, different from the concept verification POC project discussed in the previous period, we are happy to see the peers to participate in the construction of Wafer on Wafer on Wafer ecology, and everyone has a different application customers, our competitive advantage is our technology mature, lower risk to customers.

The next question, BHM in the next generation of mining machine application, in the second half of 2024 and clear revenue structure, how long will it last? In 2025 we will continue to ship the mining machine part, but the market change in the cryptocurrency mining application is relatively large, the market will continue to be relatively large, as long as we continue to invest, there will be further growth, thank you. The next question, the next question, the AI HPC layout of multiple product lines, will be affected by the U.S. ban? Well, the U.S. export regulations do not explicitly restrict our products, so the direct impact on our product type is relatively small, but in the case of frequent changes in export regulations, not only pressure on the supply chain, but also on the development of customers in Asia and Europe and America, we will continue to pay attention to the adjustments to the U.

The next question, ask the company Interposer's current number of cases, how many have been mass production? Is the Basic Model adopts WiFi sales? Is there an opportunity to cooperate with other fabs? Well, I have answered this question, Interposer has more than ten projects in progress, several have been in mass production, and this year there will be other projects in mass production, Interposer's business model, now WiFi sales, and IP licensing, there are two, there are currently, mainly wifi sales.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-based transcription:. However, IP licensing's revenue will also gradually increase. In Interposer's process and related IP development, we need a lot of resources to invest. We have just entered mass production at PSMC's Interposer. At present, we still focus on putting our existing customer service first.

The next question is about small capacitance Interposer. What do you need to do with the small capacitance Interposer Embedded in Subtrade Landsite? After the expected revenue contribution next year, the main application is to ask our business vice president Xue to answer this question.

This year's revenue contribution is relatively limited. But the future will be pretty good. Overall, last year's capacitance revenue accounted for about 5%. This year we expect to reach a double-digit share. These applications are applications in the areas of AI HPC cloud computing.

The next question is about the AI 3D Staking that PSMG has mentioned many times in cooperation with ALPHA. I can explain the current progress of the main collaboration project. Well, this is my answer. Our current stack of DRAM itself is mainly in PSMC.

PSMC is an important partner for our 3D stack ecology. This stack ecology is not only for PSMC's own DRAM, but also for more advanced DRAM stacks. It is still in development phase. But there are already customers.

We do observe that the industry is increasingly aware of the importance of high-bandwidth memory. The industry has plans to map products. But each of them has their own positioning for their respective customer base. Apple's VHM and VHM stacks can cover from cloud to edge devices to wearables. Especially VHM applications in the cloud can be more than 10 times the bandwidth of HBM. Other solutions in the market are still some distance from us.

The next question is about the general manager's point of view that the application of Connectivity connectivity has a large market competition pressure. The decline in revenue, then the next generation of IoT will be what application can complement the decline in Connectivity. This question is answered by me. As mentioned earlier, the competition in the Connectivity market is quite intense.

However, Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable - Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wearable Wear

Then our main product is customized. It's not as easy to replace standard products. Although some old specifications have some solution. But we continue to introduce new specifications. For example, just mentioned APS RAM. Then the customer also agrees with our specification advantages.

So I think the impact of localization on us is not very much. The next question is about the continuous increase in R&D manpower and costs. OPEX is expected to answer this question. OPEX is currently below 25%. We will maintain through the growth of revenue in the short term. In the medium to long term, we hope to gradually reduce this ratio.

The next question is about why RFID is not a new subject. Why did I put it into this field at the time? It is possible to further explain the potential of this market. How much revenue contribution and the practice of contributing can be expected. I answered this question. The RFID market is indeed mature.

In recent years, however, there has been no demand for the introduction of these new applications for express retailing. At present, the market for Target C is about $450 million. There is a growth of two numbers per year. This is a significant market for Apple. We expect revenue to begin this year.

The next question is about the robot application of the company's web page introduced the high-speed memory breakthrough robot's original bottleneck. Its high-speed transmission low-power characteristics extend the robot's standby time and performance. So that the robot can handle complex instructions more quickly.

We see that AI applications are part of AI applications in many ways. The low power performance of our products is a benefit for all kinds of AI applications. So we let the market allow our customers to take advantage of our products. The next question is about the C-CAP product is a colossal central product?. Colossal is the IP for the middle class.

But the news niche is a colossal slip. Can you ask me this question? The interposer we are doing at the moment is colossal slip. The market is big. Colossal intermediaries use another technique. We also have a plan.

But there is no mass production at the moment. The next question is about the planning for the use of GDR funds. Please check the progress of this section. I will answer.
