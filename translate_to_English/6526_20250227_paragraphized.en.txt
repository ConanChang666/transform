The company continues to focus on international brands and continues to expand its applications to high-end applications. Just as we look forward to 2025, we will continue to consolidate the leadership in the high-end TWS and e-sports market. Continue to expand to the commercial headsets through high-end technology, which is the Enterprise headset. While the revenue base period for 2024 is relatively high, we expect our revenues to continue to grow steadily throughout the year with the continued growth of our flagship products and high-end products, coupled with deep cooperation with the International Acoustics Corporation.

This is the first built-in AI hardware accelerator in DABA technology. These technologies help customers bring differentiated mid-range products. These products are also satisfied and certified for Microsoft Teams for business. These products also have the ability to adapt to active noise reduction.

Depending on the user's wearing conditions and different shapes. Depending on the user's wearing conditions and different shapes. These products also have the ability to adapt to active noise reduction. Depending on the user's wearing conditions and different shapes.

In addition to the above-mentioned applications, the company has also been deeply involved in the residential hall for many years. In 2024, the department has shipped more than one million smartwatch chips, which have been used throughout the world, including the US FDA OTC, OTC, over the counter, and non-medical prescriptions. With the gradual maturity of the industry and the gradual maturity of the industrial ecology, it is expected to usher in the next wave of market growth. In the satellite positioning chip section, the success of the new global well-known brand in 2024, the world's major smartwatch brands are almost Daba's customers.

In addition to the watch products, the company continues to pursue a stable market, including the development of RTK high-precision industrial applications. This part of the technology has been used in the position of AI weaving robots, trackers, agricultural drones, and outdoor wireless routers. These industrial solutions, its industrial applications, its high price not only, its competitive threshold is also relatively high, can further strengthen the stability and growth of this product line.

In addition to the current mainstream 10G PONT, the company is also developing 50G PONT, which is expected to send samples by the end of the year. Overall, in 2025, the market is expected to grow with the U.S. market as the core growth energies. Ethernet, from 5 years ago to enter the market, the market potential market in this market is the largest in our product line we know.

In the third quarter of 2024, the company completed the private equity case with Jiuyang, which was also shared with you in public places, the private equity case, the Daba technology from the original 1G 2.5 5G technology to the industrial Ethernet, so 100Face Ethernet and Ethernet Power over Ethernet. Where Power over Ethernet POE, the Ethernet power supply is what we believe is the biggest growth in the future. In addition, in the group's platform collaboration, whether it is PoE or Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi needs the integration of Ethernet to find support. With the evolution of the Internet generation, into Wi-Fi 7 to 10G. PoM, with the Ethernet interface also reached 10G. Find. So, at the end of 2024, the end of the year, the company has completed the transition to AonSemi, and further integrated the product line of 10G. Find.

In addition to the expansion of the market, the company expects to launch the 100G SURDIS product, which is 100G x 8, towards 800G light modules. This part of the goal is to win the shipping opportunity of first-line cloud service providers around the world. In addition to the Pan4DSP's electro-chips, Delta also expands to the next level of related products, such as TIA Transimpedance Amplifier, which will work with our main chip DSP, which will provide a full set of optical communication ICs.

Totally speaking.

The field of light communication is a growth momentum in 2025. Thank you Meng-Pang. Next is Q&A time, and we will reply to the pre-collected questions first. If you would like to ask further questions, please enter your company name and question in the text dialog field at the bottom right of the screen.

The first question is, as the current time is February 1, I would like to ask the company how the first quarter of the operating situation is, and what the outlook for the year 2025 is, what is the reason? First of all, let us report that we have announced the consolidated revenue in January at the beginning of February, the amount is probably $17.4 billion, an increase of NT$11.7% month-to-month, and an increase of 66.2% year-to-year. Throughout the whole year 2024, we return to a more normal seasonal change, and the fourth quarter is relatively low.

First of all, customers focus on the tariff issue of pre-loading, followed by the previously mentioned Bluetooth audio products, the launch of a flagship AI Bluetooth chip, the first quarter began to ship officially. In the wide-screen products, the U.S. and U.S. customers continue to generate revenue contribution, so this first quarter is expected to outperform last quarter. But recently the overall economy is full of uncertainty with global policies, we will still closely monitor the market's status and dynamically adjust.

Looking forward to 2025, although 2024 has hit a record high and its relatively high market status, we will continue to strive to pursue the overall revenue growth. The next question is to ask the company's main growth momentum throughout the year 2025, and how to look at the growth of each product line. Can you provide a sort of growth rate? In terms of the sort of growth rate, the relatively low base period is relatively large, so the sort of growth rate should be relatively high.

The light communication part is also because the basis period is relatively low, starting from 2024, the single channel multi- 8 400G to cloud service providers, this part is low, but the relative threshold is high, then with just mentioned this TIA this year's growth rate will be the strongest. Then the Ethernet part, the Ethernet TEMP is the largest, then we have just reported a few large layouts last year, so this year will be gradually landing, Ethernet is also a significant product line year-over-year growth relative to major product lines.

Looking ahead to 2025, we will expand to the global carrier market, with more control over the European and American carriers. Projects that have been cut into the last two years will be landed, so 25 years of revenue is expected to be better than 2024. In addition to the high-end TWS and e-sports markets already occupy most of the top ten global brands, in 2025 we will continue to strengthen the TWS3 e-sports market and seize more market share through high-end products in the commercial drag-and-drop headset, especially the introduction of ABE595 flagship Bluetooth audio chip in the first quarter, we will put commercial-grade noise reduction performance into consumer headsets.

What is the recent supply of consumer electronics technology in mainland China? What is the supply of consumer electronics technology in mainland China recently? What is the supply of consumer electronics technology in mainland China recently? What is the supply of consumer electronics technology in mainland China recently?

China's secondary income is still to be observed. Is there any question about the benefit of the return on inventory in the fourth quarter, and the future? How should we expect the trend of gross profit margin in 2025? Well, then I'm going to go into the previous financial operational report, gross profit margin. In 2024, it was really affected by some inventory return benefits, mainly the 2024 revenue has reached a new high, the overall inventory depreciation has reached a fairly good expectation, so this proportion of the amount of inventory is relatively low.

That is why we expect or expect to have a statement from all investors and legal persons here that we will exclude the impact of this reinstatement benefit.

In 2025, the impact of the company will gradually decrease, and the company will set the target at a level of about 48 to 50% or more. The next question is how the management looks at the current inventory level, sinking into the previous part of the report, the number of days in the previous part of the week, the number of days in the previous quarter, from the second quarter of 2024, the number of weeks in the third quarter continued to increase, although the revenue continued to increase, although our DOI was slightly rising from my week to 67 days in the fourth quarter. The next question is whether the actual figures in 2024, operating expenses increased by more than 30% compared to the previous year, looking at the company's main reasons and 2025 business expenses. Here we also explain that 2024 operating expenses growth mainly comes from a number of factors. In fact, the biggest expense of IC design companies is about 70% of the total expenses associated with people, which includes dividends, including principal economic expenses, including principal allowances, etc. The latter of our executive vice president, Mr. Meng Han, told you a brief overview of the company in the past two years, and the next generation of new product 50GPON plans have been opened in the Bluetooth audio part, and process development.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the rules and examples from the user carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will examine the verbatim fragments provided, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

For example, questions and answers about Bluetooth audio products should be arranged sequentially, while parts of gross profit need to be sequentially sequential. It is important to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to make sure that there are no omissions or misplacements. At the same time, repeated or similar sentences, for example, "so it is more of a watershed industry" appear twice, need to be kept as they are, without any modification.

In addition, note that vacancies in timestamps such as [2485. 62-2487. 62] may need to be checked for missing content, but the data provided by the user should be kept as it is. During the process, it is also necessary to ensure the consistency of each paragraph, using the appropriate punctuation and line change to separate different questions and answers. For example, when the "Next Question Is" appears, a new paragraph may need to be started to distinguish between different questions. Finally, check the entire finishing copy to ensure that all sentences are arranged correctly without omissions or errors and in accordance with the format requested by the user.

The next question is the strong performance of Bluetooth audio products last year. In the previous section, we shared some thoughts on 2025, and wanted to expand our understanding of how the company expects growth and growth momentum in the next one to three years? Bluetooth audio is widely used in a wide range of applications, including consumer, esports, business, household halls, speakers, and so on.

In the past few years, we have strategically collaborated with almost all of the international brands, basically moving to advanced education products. Last year's innovation was mainly focused on consumer and esports, but this year we will focus on enterprise, which is the expansion of the business field, the goal is to win more business headsets market share. This part of the use of online conferences in the office environment, as well as the customer service center headphones, these areas need to wear for a long time, also need high-end noise reduction, and more low-power consumption, which can highlight the product competitiveness of Dafa technology for many years.

The next question is whether to extend the question of whether the company can provide more information, such as the status of each product line Mao benefit? Hello, I am Anderson, the parts of Mao benefit, I generally have three branches, then we have two business segments are high-end AI Internet of Things and Internet of Things infrastructure, and the other we are classified into other parts of the network, including light communication, Jiuyang setabox, etc., because these lines accounted for about the current proportion of the company, so we are roughly divided into these three categories.

The next question is whether there will be a M&A investment plan for the senior company in the future? What is the possible direction? I think whether it is a merger or a strategic investment, or even a directorship seat, this we will continue to do. In that direction, may be the main target of the network, this part of course also mentioned, in order to complement our senior company's investment plan, we also in the Ethereum part of the senior company, the high-end 10G5, we also successful at the end of the year this strategic investment AEON SEMI, which let us from G5 2. 5G5 to 10G5, to 10G5 the whole of the whole, the whole from low to high and complete, then we will stand up the director here at AEON SEMI, which we will continue to do, especially in the part of the network, which is the whole layout, or the results, and may have to wait for the announcement, to explain. The next question is to ask the company to see how the market view of the 2025, the current status of the current situation, and what the current situation of the bus expansion of what competitive the operator?

But of course, because the time is longer, so it belongs to a thin water flow industry, so it belongs to a thin water flow industry. In the past, this field from the DSL line, GPO 10GPOM to the future 25G 50G POM, about 5 to 10 years, 5 to 10 years there will be a generation, it is also necessary to go back to this previous generation of interoperability testing, so this part of the in fact, no matter the tender bidding or interoperability testing, we have established a very deep management with the operator.

I think the first advantage is that the Ironfield Group is doing the whole low power, power saving green power, this part is a big advantage. I think our current PanforDSP, whether it is a cloud service provider or the ODM, these advantages are very recognition of our low power, energy saving advantages above.

This part, uh, that after all, we are, uh, although still 50G, but we already have this international shipping, shipping time is right. So for now, uh, we are here with Cloud Service Provider, and then we will not exclude it, because the overall just these four blocks is a complete solution, and then, if necessary, we need to work together to work together, and the size is flat, we will not exclude it. Thank you for your advances, due to the relationship of time, our law today will come to the end. If there is no reply or further questions, welcome to contact our IR team, thank you for your valuable comments.

The conference briefing will be uploaded to the public information observation station and the company wide web. Once again, thank you for your participation, I wish you all the best, thank you.
