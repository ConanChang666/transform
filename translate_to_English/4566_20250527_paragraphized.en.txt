<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it into a paragraph verbatim text. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the conversation at each point in time. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I check the structure of the original script. Each entry has a timestamp and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order into a naturally smooth paragraph, while keeping the order and content of each sentence unchanged. This means that it is necessary to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or the same person's speech, and then combine them into paragraphs.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, not because of time jumps. During the processing process, I may encounter some challenges, such as how to handle different parts of the same person's continuous speech, or how to group sentences at different points in a reasonable group.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the consistency of punctuation and sentences. The sentences in the original verb may end with periods or commas, but when converting to paragraphs, you may need to adjust the punctuation to ensure the smoothness of the paragraphs, but the user requests do not change the content, so it can only be adjusted without changing the original intention. Finally, I will read the entire converted paragraph type verb, check whether all the original content is properly preserved, without omissions, or errors.

We are pleased to invite you to join us as our presenter. As you know, the advanced stone industry is an important manufacturer of machinery processing in China, and its layout spans industries, automobiles, and even semiconductors and aerospace fields. Its market width is also across Asia and Europe and the United States.

We are honored to have Mr. Huang Yaxin, Founder and President of Shek Plastics Industry Group, and Mr. Yi Yaxin, Chairman of Shek Plastics Industry. Hello everyone, and Ms. Liu, Chairman of Shek Plastics Industry, and our spokesperson for Shek Plastics Industry.

We are very pleased that you have come to us. We are excited that you have joined us to establish our second phase of the Law Conference. It is our pleasure to invite our Group President and Founder, Mr. Huang, to exchange views with you today. The report will be divided into three parts. The first is an overview of the Group and an organizational structure by the President of the Group.

The second stage has a report on the financial numerical follow-up. The third stage has the president's re-adjustment to his future outlook for the organization. Outlook is a promising market for the future. Finally, we will give you the outlook and the theme of the market. We will then make a Q&A exchange for you. That's what we see above.

I first gave the time to the President, and made a report on his current plan for the group. Everyone is at the same time forward in the afternoon. I believe the people who come here want to negotiate that you should be more fortunate than me. Because in terms of the way in which you look at these companies will be facing this so-called tariff problem weddings can change. But I tell you, not what kind of pattern you are going to change now, but how you have planned before.

But if you didn't do the market dispersion before, without doing this so-called area dispersion, you really don't get the pattern. I'm with you today, so I'd like to share this opportunity with you. Of course, I'd like to think that some of the investments are advanced and some are new. Some of our new talents speak well for us.

Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Vice President of Launch. Thank you. I would like to share with you a few ideas now. First of all, let's update on what this group is all about. We recently added something.

You can take a look at the bases for producing your own marketing. Taiwan's new home Taiwan's Youss. Taiwan's Taichung plant, the so-called Tianya Honghai in the past. We have recently accounted for 75 shares, which include the chairman's house. Including Taiwan, China's Wuxi plant, China's Suzhou plant, China's Suzhou plant.

We recently also had anti-soft holdings, keeping it together. OK. China is inside our entire group. CNN team includes the parts we are preparing for construction in Thailand spring alone. So basically we talked to you before that, actually plastic has been making a global layout. The layout of the industry, but it's important.

We do everything vertically. This is a series of things to look at and say to everyone. Some people can see it is said. This is where we are very inside of China's Xi'an. There is another in Xi'an. Why I go to Xi'an.

Many people are asking us this question. Xi'an is speaking of mainland China, people are the richest. Especially in this precision entrepreneur factory. Because it has a lot of military industry. Relatively, we also set up a factory in Tongchuan at the same time. We are doing precision residency at the same time.

Because precision building it belongs to a so-called energy consumption relatively large. In some areas of China, it does not allow such a large energy consumption industry. In the entire harsh area. But in the Tongchuan of Shaanxi, we are also greatly supported by the government. Why do we do this? Or go back to what a warrior integrated.

In addition to our new homes and young teachers in Taiwan, this is where we continue to grow. I believe that some of us know that we are in the new home, and we have bought another piece of land, and we are doing what we have changed. In addition, in Wuxi, we had a change in 2019 before the pandemic, including when China-China trade began, and we decided to invest 2.5 billion dollars in Wuxi Anzheng Factory.

9% increase. These are all plans to prove our early layout. Relatively speaking, this is a new factory of security. If some of you want to know more about us, welcome to go and see there. This is also a benchmark industry. Relatively speaking, we are in Taichung Tianyang.

In 2021, when the aerospace industry was at the bottom of the valley, we determined to invest, and then to undertake a certain share of Sumito. So far, our shares have reached 75%. That is, the original investor, the original founder he has left. We are undertaking this company.

Why we undertake this company. Or return to an industry, the ability to serve first-hand. Just like I would introduce it. He made stamping in Suzhou, China, and made the pumping molding. This is also the company we invested in in 2020. This year we also acquired it and invested it in full.

Why we do this in NCE. It's important that today's company is in one place, and when all businesses face a situation, there must be someone to be the boss, to take the team forward. Many companies are now stuck, and even retreat, or even close, because leaders can't continue to take the team forward, which is the biggest consideration.

This is our new colleague, who is British, who has more than 30 years of experience in the aerospace industry, has marketing and manufacturing management. He is currently in Taiwan, responsible for my factory in Taichung. We are responsible for Taichung factory.

We asked him why. The first I knew him 10 years ago, the second he was my client in the past.

Now the company is in the whole disease. We invite him back. Because the aerospace industry is an international industry. Today I am a yellow skin. I can do more work. But to talk about yellow skin.

Compare with this so-called British. Strong in the industry. There are still a lot of British. He is now leading my space team. And the ocean team is integrated together. We're back to the global market.

The first is always integrated. The second is always horizontal cooperation. Now let's talk about one more thing.

Why TSMC is talking about it now. Fuguo Shenshan. TSMC is talking about it. With other so-called packaging, it is the packaging industry. The most different place.

This includes Chen quietly. I'm Mr. Cao. I don't speak to anyone. But TSMC is there. His window is inside. Continue to do the stacking action.

He continues to work on stacks. Each stack speaks for itself. He does a good connection. So the implementation is today. We are not alone.

Or just in the stamping. We have always wanted to do a one-time integration. Do the stacking cooperation. So we are talking about. By integrating at any time.

In the same small box, our technical ability can be improved again. A service item can be combined continuously. This is how we serve our customers.

We can expand the resources. Expand the resources. You can see. That's why.

Today we are talking about the future. We will continue to grow. Everyone can see. It's all automated. It's our factory in Anjong.

All of the tops are solar. All of the production equipment is automated. Including inspection equipment. This is even the factory.

I'd like to introduce it to everyone. We all know China. Cars are windy. But we're on top of Biani. We're into Biani's supply chain. And we're still growing.

This is what the Lord says: "Let us make this day known unto you, and let us make this day known unto you, and let us make known unto you all the wonders of the land, which the Lord our God hath made known unto you."

This is the story of our Lord's resurrection, the resurrection of the dead, the resurrection of the just and the unjust, the resurrection of the just and the unjust, the resurrection of the just and the unjust.

We are the system of Siemens UG. Plus TIC Center. Including what we've been doing internally. Internally has been doing. An integration in doing it.

So many guests came to the past, when we went to the old factory to see him, he leisurely west, we rely on our mountain snakes, to persuade guests.

The customer came in, and at the end of the talk was only one price, because he saw this factory, he was very clear.

And he said unto them, Behold, we have seen the king's house, and we have heard him, and we have heard him, and we see him, and we see him, and we see him, and we see him, and we see him, and we see him.

Not that you're talking about today. Do it in a traditional way. This industry is becoming more and more. Large-scale economic capital investment. Talent gathering and management. This series of things.

We are all in the past. We spend a lot of time managing. Relative to machining. We even include its cleaning. Cleaning packaging in a clean room.

This is a great reward for those who do good deeds, and for those who do evil deeds, and for those who do evil deeds, We have prepared for those who do good deeds, and We have prepared for those who do evil deeds.

Fast doing. Development of precision molding from the design. Special processing of machining. This war service. Relative to everyone can see. Speed has been talked about.

This way, you can see. We are in the safety system field of the car. Almost 80% of it is covered. AutoLeak Joseph Diesel includes BYD.

In this section of the car drive. There is also a new energy car on top of it. We have foreign brands. Borgona Eton even tells us.

China is very popular. BYD Geely. So we are talking about internationalization at the same time. Also in the localization of the holy root. relative to us. In the industrial application of the words above.

Including ships. That includes words. That is, petrochemical industry. Semiconductor industry. Automated companies. All of this is here.

You can see it all. Relatively speaking. In space. These things. We are talking about space.

We only have 12.5 million in the first quarter of last year, mainly our gross profit margin, the gross profit margin was up to 24.05, compared to the last quarter of last year.3 But our OP impact, here is what I have to say, is that our combined Suzhou industry and Tianan Aerospace, we have a lot of recognition of about 38 million.We are worried about the exchange rate, our exchange rate in the first quarter of last year is positive, or 3.50 million.If you go to compare the first quarter of last year, it is true that the exchange rate is a big part of the exchange revenue, I think all the listing is the same, but this year our company is a positive one of 36 million.

I would like to report to you that the company margin wise, as a whole last year, remained in the fourth quarter of last year, mainly the difference between accounting treatment. In the fourth quarter last year, because accounting principal recognized an adjustment in innovation, so our margin was downward. We also recognized some of the goodwill impairments we acquired, so we created the accounting earnings negative last year, but operating wise still margin remain stable, so overall, so we still have to look at the outlook that we have seen so far this year.

In addition to the above, the president's capacity allocation of the factory in Wuxi, it is clear that the 48% of the factory in Taiwan has reached 32% since two years ago, but Wuxi, because of these first-class customers brought China's revenue up, so the continent of Wuxi, the part of the diversified allocation of this company will continue to produce a change in the number of hours. That in the international customer section, I think you are most concerned about this trade tariff issue, and the president specifically asked me to organize it, you can take a look at the U.S. domestic in the first quarter of this year, about 22%, you read my food notes also, about 9%, only 10 taxable tax, so 9% affect our high single digital, unlike some listed companies have relatively heavy impact. But overall, we can see that because our sales strategy is a long-term cloud, because it is relatively killing in Asia market, because it is nearly 20 trillions now, so it's own, so we can see our configuration.

In August, the regulation of capital was more than two billion dollars in this year to be first published, but the company began to do this in 2022, so the President's thinking in this regard is relatively fast. The other is the official evaluation of the company's font, the company in 40 to 50 to 100 billion reached the top 5%, so overall, the company's own parts in the ESG part of the progress.

Eric has a very short time to join, but because he is very professional and has experience in this field, at the same time, I told you to come to work quickly when I first interview, and that we really had a fate. That said, I believe that in fact, business operators and the general public of your investment may have some language barriers or some understanding of the pain, but I am grateful that our team has put together this series. So let me share with you today, Mr. Trump, on April 2, will not release that tariff on April 1, and when the tariff on April 2, it is important that all investors have a big question about the title of your investment, and in the end what effect this tariff on the company's investment, which is very important.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription after rehearsal: But North America, really speaking, is only 9% of our duty, so it is limited. At that time, it was said that the customer is responsible for the duty of North America is 145, plus the original 25, total of 170. At that time, it was changed from 145 to 30, and the customer said that I was going to pay the duty by themselves, as long as I am witnessing one thing, when your industry, when your competitiveness continues to strengthen, when the customer finds other substitutes, you still have to say, you have chips, sit down with the guest, you will get reasonable treatment, this is what we are talking about.

So here we can see that we are talking about Suzhou factory, what we are doing in Suzhou factory, Suzhou factory, Suzhou factory, Suzhou factory, the original production is doing onions and dumplings, we should do onions and dumplings, because we practice, in the past, we can do onions and dumplings, and now all industry applications, because we are actually lightweight and low price, so it is only the machine, its production, its development is limited, so the machine with the duck word, it is actually, we can expand the business, for the same customer, we can be a first-class service, that we can expand the business, for the same guest, we can be a first-class service, that for the same guest, we can be a first-class service, that for the last time, we can be compared to the past, we have said, we can be a second-class service, we have a second-class service, and then a second-class service, and then, in the relative, in the second time, apart, apart, apart, I believe that we are concerned, that is that is that is that we are concerned with what what what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what we are here, we are here. So, I'm here to tell you, we have some confidential things, we can't declare at the moment, but let's take a look at what these things are, I believe a lot of professional people, investors can see, we talk about the so-called server, or is the heat dissipation module, some things, some things are all the future, we are in the future development, we are in the development of the future, there is a future development of what we are in the development of sampling, there is a thing in the quotation, this is a thing is VIPA, we call VIPA, we call VIPA, we call VIPA Chamber, this is something, because we are now such a traditional Sician language, it is not possible, this is special, we have a team, now in Suzhou, we have a team, now in Suzhou, we will continue to strengthen this thing, this thing, this thing, to give people to look at this, I think, I think, we have a lot of the team, we have a lot, we know, in addition to talk about, we are, we are, we are, we, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we, we are talking about, we are talking about, we, we, we are talking about, we, we, we, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we, we are talking about, we, we are talking about, we, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about, we are talking about

In the case of direct entry into the supply chain, the relative challenge is very high. In the case of direct entry into the supply chain, it is very high. In the international field, in the aerospace industry, it is a machine, including bar processing, including ingredients processing. In the case of aluminum alloy casting, aluminum alloy yarns, including the so-called net cap sensor, including surface treatment, including non-destructive inspection, including some things that are soldered and assembled, are a series of things.

But what is important is that in terms of aerospace, we are talking about the service energy of the defense and aerospace industry in low-key. There is also a sky, but we are still relatively low-key, and we try to talk about the military. But in terms of business, we are slowly making money. But we are still focusing on the international market. That is our new general manager, and I just told you. That is important to say, why we dream so deep on the aerospace, COVID, today in the market, all the big customers in the international market, the biggest pain point is that his supply chain has at least 4000 to 5000, 4000 to 5000 to 5000, the impact of COVID, many small companies have disappeared, and many small companies have not seen.

So today, including not fully recovered, so they are very anxious to find a supplier can throw, upstream and downstream integration, which is really not the future, which is the reason why we have a good company. That includes we refer to the same time, we also bought the land in Thailand, and set up the company. In the future, there will be some customers in Taiwan, we need to have a production base in the third place, we have a plan in Thailand, and there is a plan in Thailand. This is the first time that we have been able to meet the needs of our customers, we have been able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers. We will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers, and we will meet the needs of our customers, and we will be able to meet the needs of our customers.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this speech mainly involves the company's development history, management strategy, market positioning, and future planning. The speaker mentioned how to stand out from ten competitors, to be the only one, and how to drive business growth through small unit management, such as Cost Function Team.

In addition, it also mentions the importance of market share in automotive safety systems, new energy, aerospace, and other fields, as well as the importance of internationalization strategy and localization. Next, I need to determine how to group these sentences and form a natural paragraph. Generally, paragraph division should be based on topical consistency. For example, sentences about the company's development journey can form a paragraph, the sentences that manage the strategy, and the field of market data and business can form a third paragraph, the internationalization and localization strategy can form the fourth paragraph, and the final summary and future planning.

In the same way, in the part of the management strategy, we combine sentences such as "we do small things", "every small unit", "we do small things" and "we do small things" into a paragraph that illustrates the organization structure of the company. At the same time, pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the sequence of sentences is consistent with the original transcription. For example, in the user's transcription, timestamps are from 1829. 00 to 2130. 00, each timestamp corresponds to a sentence. I need to sort these sentences in chronological order, but they are grouped into paragraphs instead of sentences. In the process, some sentences may encounter connection problems between sentences, such as some sentences may be incomplete in the syntax, or need context to understand.

In addition, it is important to note that duplicate sentences, such as "everyone can look at" appear twice in the context, and "significant growth" are repeated twice in the context. These duplicates need to be retained at the time of the conversion, but can be segmented to reduce the repetitive interference. Finally, I will read the passage-style transcription after the conversion, check whether all sentences are correctly contained, without omissions or sequence errors. At the same time, make sure the transition between paragraphs is natural, the content is coherent, in line with the logical structure of the speech. In conclusion, my step is to 1) read and understand the contents and structure of the original transcription; 2) group the sentences into paragraphs according to the subject and logical relationship; 3) keep the original sequence and content unchanged, adjust only the format; 4) check whether the converted paragraphs are coher to the user's.

By doing so, ensure that the final paragraph-based verbatim is both in line with the specific requirements of the user, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the original content. </think> The following is a paragraph-based verbatim re-array based on the original verbatim content (fully retaining all the original sentences, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed anything): --- We spent.

We're the only ones who stand out now. We're the only ones, and we're actually expanding. This quantification is actually expanding. That's where it comes in.

This is what I see here. Let's take a look at the implementation. How do we manage it?

We use the company as a small unit. Every small unit. We put it as a small group. You may have heard it. We call it Cost Function Team. Similar to the concept of Amiba.

Similar to Zhang Ruimin. The concept of a single person. Inside each small unit. Focus on specific customers. Each small unit. We are always following.

His new product, the development of the new product, the progress of the development of the new product, this is our internal data, for everyone to do a reference, so we can see the recent data.

As you can see, we are divided into three main categories. The main four categories. The first is in the car safety system. Because of what is relatively bearable.

Our new focus is 8%. In new energy. It is the Compass engine drive. Our new focus is 51%. The relative part of the new energy vehicle.

That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's what we've been paying attention to, that's what we've been doing all along.

I have been focusing on the development of the whole business opportunity. It is the same with the aircraft. The aerospace aluminum alloy casting. Precision casting sand casting. Already included this NetApp certification. This is something.

Speed is in this respect in the precision five harvesting machine. So we provide first-hand services. These things are about it. Includes auxiliary power. Inclusive machine engine environmental control system. Including these so-called.

This trust reverse. The bottom plate automatic. This is a series of things. I have a seat. I invite this person to advance. The people's chief minister to take a look.

The day will come when all will be gathered together, and all will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together.

I really entered the team in 2023. Be a representative. Be a representative. Act them to make a difference. We wake up from the world of sleeping. You can see. You can see.

It's obviously a growth. It's obviously growth. It's not accidental. It's speed. We're talking about it.

There are so many things that come to mind when it comes to management. Management comes from culture, because it comes from culture, because it comes from culture, because it knows how to think.

Because of the strategy. Think about how the organization is planning. With the planning of the organization. Really think about how the talent gathers. How the talent stays. This series of things.

CSOP If Many People Know. Recently there is a professor Li Jiren. Talking about transformation is talking. Now I'm growing up. I'm really his fan.

"This is what we have done, and this is what we have done," he said, "and this is what we have done, and this is what we have done."

If you are looking for a place to spend a lot of time, then this is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.This is the place for you.

I have the opportunity to invite you to look at it. It's a solid machine. It's a machine. It's a combination. It's important. It's different from the biggest selling point of other companies. It's important that we're different from the biggest selling point of other companies.

The most important thing is to end up with something I want to share with you. Because the international situation changes, I will tell you, there is no single place. You can be completely helpless.
