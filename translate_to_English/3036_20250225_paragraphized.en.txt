Welcome to the online Investor Conference of the 4th Quarter of 2024, organized by Wen-Ji Technology Co., Ltd. We have invited Eric Cheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Wen-Ji. Please share with you Eric hello.

Hello everyone. We are also in the presence of the investor relations associate Ricky Liu and Yvonne Tsai, vice president of Yunzhen.

The Chairman then gives a brief description of the operation outlook. Then, our Vice President Tsai summarizes our questions on-site by the Chairman. If you have a question, please click on the button below and write down your name and representative company and your question in a window of the speech. Well, we will now pass the time to the Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman.

So I'll start by talking about the financial figures for the fourth quarter. The consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $261.9 billion and slightly increased by 38% year-on-year compared to the previous quarter over $252525 billion. The reason for this is mainly because some data center revenues that were originally expected to be shipped in the first quarter were shipped in advance of the fourth quarter.

The fourth quarter is a relatively low season in Europe and the United States. This also shows that the stock degradation in the European and American markets continues but gradually improves. Currently, it looks like the fourth quarter is the bottom of the cycle. Next, we see that gross margin is 44% lower than expected by the car.

This quarter's operating cost is 65.7 billion yuan, which is around 3% lower than the lower edge of the car. This is due to the relatively low cost of goods shipped. This quarter's operating profit is 4.2 billion yuan close to the edge of the car. This is mainly due to the lower cost.

The operating profit quarter increased by 1% year-on-year to 120% year-on-year. Operating interest rates were 1.6% from 1.5% to 1.7% of the range of financial vehicles. The net financial cost of this quarter was about 10,6 billion yuan withheld from interest income.

In addition, in the fourth quarter, there are other external revenues of about $1.5 billion. Overall, net profit of $2.54 billion is higher than 24.3 billion in the middle of the financial sector. The increase was 11% year-on-year, up 143%. The decrease was mainly due to the high external income of Q3. The basic earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $2.7 billion, which is also higher than the median financial sector.

The basic earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $2.7 billion and were higher than the $21.7 billion in the median financial sector. The quarterly decline was 11% year-on-year, up 90%. Among them, the combined Future figures from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 2024 were consolidated. Without the combined Future figures, the overall revenue-to-earnings ratio in the first quarter was higher than in 2023.

Gross profit grew by 104% year-on-year. Gross profit was 3.92% year-on-year compared to 3.1% year-on-year in 2023. Operating profit increased by 86% year-on-year. The annual financial cost of 42.5 billion year-on-year increased by 14% year-on-year showing that although borrowings after the acquisition of Future increased, working capital continued to be improved.

Let's take a look at the main financial indicator trends. The top left corner can see that the fourth quarter revenue remains high. Gross margin 4. 12% is slightly lower than the third quarter. Mainly the product portfolio relationship mentioned above. The sales margin on the right is 11. 65% flat compared to the third quarter.

The entire business leverage of Future is better, so if the European and American market recovers in the future, the demand will go back to revenue. The business interest rate will have the opportunity to increase. The combined gross profit for the third quarter of this year. The blue part of the working capital recovery period is the number of days of revenue. The 54 days in the third quarter are reduced to 53 days in the fourth quarter.

Green Bar is the number of days in stock that increase from 51 days in the third quarter to 55 days in the fourth quarter. While the number of days in stock increases, you can see that the number of days in your account also increases, so the overall working capital recovery period is still very efficient from 43 days in the third quarter to 42 days in the fourth quarter. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and convert it into a paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how these transcriptions are merged into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I will read through the entire transcription to identify different topics or topics. For example, the first part of the discussion is the RWC operating capital return, followed by an annualized shareholder interest rate (ROE), followed by a financial estimate for the first quarter of 2025, and finally a market trend and outlook. Each topic may require a separate segment, but there is a logical coherence between the sentences. Next, I need to check whether the timestamp is continuous, whether there is a jump or missing part. For example, in a segment provided by the user, there is no content between the timestamps, such as from 550. 86 to 555. 86, 86, which may mean that there is a skip in the original text, but the user requests not to delete any sentences, so all the sentences provided, even if the timestamps have an interval.

For example, there are several sentences about RWC that need to be combined consistently while maintaining the order of the original sentences. Similarly, the part about ROE also needs to be combined. It is important to note that some sentences may start with "that", which are common in spoken language, but may need to be adjusted in written language, but user requirements do not change, so it must be retained.

In addition, be aware of the correct representation of the figures and percentages, such as "14.5%", "10.4%", etc., to ensure that they are in the correct position in the paragraph. At the same time, check if there is duplicate or redundant information, but according to the requirements of the user, nothing can be deleted, so even if there is duplicate, it must be retained. In processing the financial estimates section, it is necessary to ensure that each data point (e.g. revenue, gross profit margin, operating expenses, etc.) is correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs. For example, the financial estimates for the first quarter of 2025 include revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, etc., these should be segmented, but maintain the order of the original sentence.

At the same time, make sure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, consistent with the routine treatment of spoken-to-writing, without any rewriting or condensation. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as the interval between timestamps, the condensation of words (such as "that", "that"), and the repetitive information. However, according to the user's request, everything must be strictly retained, so it is necessary to carefully handle these parts to ensure that the converted text meets the user's requirements and remains readable.

The following is a segmented transcription based on the transcription fragment you provided (totally retain all original sentences, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed): --- Then we see the RWC working capital return. The fourth quarter of that year, ROWC was 14.5%, which was a better level than the third quarter, compared to the company's long-term ratio, or compared to the major industry in the world. The fourth quarter of that year, net working capital compared to revenue, and the quarter remained flat at 0.12.

The group after the merger of Future, can see a significant contribution to ROE. The current level of company ROE is also better than the major industry peers around the world. Next, let's look at the financial estimates for the first quarter of 2025, which is based on the exchange rate assumptions of $1 to NT32.6.

The median median revenue was $22.8 billion, where the median median saw a 13% decline in quarters, an increase of 18% year-on-year. If the WT split between the WT and the Future, the WT estimated a decline in quarters in the Mid-Teen quarter. That said, in addition to the traditional low season for consumer products, there was a mention that this product had a low margin, which had impacted revenue in the first quarter of this quarter.

So, if we see the gross profit margin, the estimated median of the gross profit margin was 4.8%, which was a very significant increase in the 4.12 of the fourth quarter. That's just what we've mentioned since this quarter saw a decrease in revenue, mainly because of the median of the low gross margin, rather than the decrease in gross profit products. But what we see is that the demand for this product is continuing to grow. So, the gross profit margin of the WT itself has been rising due to changes in the product portfolio.

Gross profit is estimated to be 10.9 billion yuan, up 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, up 125% year-over-year. The median operating cost is estimated to be 66.1 billion yuan, the median operating cost is 2.9%, slightly higher than the previous quarter, as QOQ has declined more in the first quarter, and the product portfolio has changed significantly. The median operating profit is estimated to be 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, with a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase, up 66% year-over-year.

At the end of the day, we saw the net profit of the salmon parent company, where the median estimate was 25.7 billion yuan, an increase of 62% year-on-year. Overall, although the first quarter was a traditional low season for the industry, since the product portfolios increased, we expected that there would be more than a quarter of the season-on-season performance. EPS said that the median estimate was 2,3 billion quarter-on-quarter increase of 1%, an increase of 45% year-on-year. Next, we asked the Chairman to update the market situation and outlook.

In 2024, the combined profits also reached a new high. Currently, the merger with Future has progressed smoothly. The market outlook has basically reached the highest level in Asia, and the adjustments have been completed. Last year, most companies have also begun to show year-on-year growth. Inventory adjustments in North America should also be nearing the end, and Europe is still improving, and it is expected that the next two quarters will continue to roll out.

This year, the market should begin to recover slowly, and AI applications are becoming more popular, driving more end product growth. This year, the overall market demand should grow more than 2024. Next, let's look at the trend of the market, the overall semiconductor market has been adjusted in the past two years, and the market demand has gradually rebounded. According to GaN's latest forecast, the global semiconductor market growth rate of 2025 was 12.7%, which was lower than the previous 13.8%.

All kinds of chips will have a certain amount of growth. The long-term compound growth rate of the semiconductor market between 2024 and 2028 is estimated to be 7.3%, compared to the last estimated 6.1%. The market size of 2028 will be higher, which will reach US$8294 billion. The compound growth rate of the memory-free market between 2024 and 2028 is about 8.7%, which is also improved compared to the last estimated 7.7%.

In addition, the IPNE market is estimated to have a compound growth rate of 5.3% from 2024 to 2028, and the market size of the IPNE market will reach US$24 billion in 2028. In summary, the market size of the company will significantly increase from US$630 billion in all semiconductor markets in 2024 to US$1 trillion if it includes semiconductors and IPNE will reach US$1 trillion in 2028.

The company will continue to invest resources and high growth, the application areas of high gross profit such as the automotive industry communication data center and server, the goal of these application markets can have a high growth rate, so that the company's overall growth is better than the market. Next, let's look at the company's application insolv distribution in the fourth quarter of the application.

The following is a re-extracted paragraph-by-phrase transcript: [1120. 86-1150. 86] The fourth quarter of the group surged by 12%, of which WT surged by about 19% and Future Slashed by 10%. [1150. 86-1162. 86] WT actively deployed China's electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles to continue to gain market share, especially in the fourth quarter of Europe. [1162. 86-1182. 86] Overall, the industrial and instrumentation surged by 10%, and the WT surged by 3%. But I just said that this field gradually went to the bottom. [1182. 86-1195. 86] The WT surged by 4%, and the Future surged by 3%.

Overall industrial demand has yet to see a recovery in the fourth quarter. [1195. 86-1204. 86] Communications businesses are mostly WT, with a 12% drop in the fourth quarter. We are still positive about long-term growth in light communications, but there is a shift in shipments in the short-term. [1204. 86-1224. 86] The revenue from data centers and servers in this part of the data center also came from WT, a 3% drop in the fourth quarter. We are positive about mid-to-long-term growth in AI, but there is a shift in shipments between quarters. [1224. 86-1238. 86] Consumer electronics in the fourth quarter was 7% slashed, with a 12% drop in WT.

This is mainly a seasonal factor, and Future presents a surge of 11%. [1238. 86-1252. 86] In fact, this has been reflected in the inventory of some products in Europe and America has gradually deteriorated, and some inventory backing up requirements. PCs mainly come from WT, which has 6% decline in the fourth quarter. [1252.1259. 86] is mainly a seasonal factor, and mobile phones come from WT, which has a surge of 15% in the fourth quarter.

[1272. 86-1291. 86] According to the application of other vehicles increased by 34% year-on-year, 9% year-on-year, 10% year-on-year, 60% year-on-year datacenter year-on-year, 12% year-on-year consumer electronics year-on-year, 8% year-on-year PC year-on-year, and 8% year-on-year mobile phone year-on-year. [1291. 86-1305. 86] So we can see that the demand for industrial and consumer electronics in the fourth quarter of 2024 has grown in comparison to 2023. [1305-1311. 86] But this is part of Asia and then to Page16. [1311. 86-1324. 86] Let's take a look at the company's year-year-year-on-year sales of application-year, Startup Attention's revenue has increased to 68%. [1324. 1324. 86] The same lower-on-on-year-on-on-to-on-on-on-on-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-the-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to

[1339. 86-1346. 86] The communication increased by 36% year-on-year, which also benefited from AI driving, and then data centers and servers significantly increased by 167% year-on-year. [1346. 86-1359. 86] Consumer electronics and other year-on-year decreases by 1%, and PCs have reached 12% year-on-year after 2023. [1359. 86-1636. 86] Mobile phones have increased by 5% year-on-year, and this is our report today. [1365. 86-1346. 86] Okay, thanks for the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and let's take a moment to remind you that if you need to ask a question, write down your representative's name and questionnaire in the conversation window. [1363. 86-1386. 86-1386. 86] Then we will summarize the overall look at collect everyone's questions, and then silence for 1 to 2 minutes, and reply. [1386. 86-1400. 86]

[1400. 86-1419. 86] Thank you, today's discussion first let you notice the Recent. [1419. 86-1420. 86] xu. [1420. 86-1421. 86] Good. [1421. 86-1441. 34] Now views. [1441-1443. 78] One. [1443. 78-1444. 86] Two.

[1460. 44-1462. 64] We have requested Eric. [1462. 64-1465. 80] The first part of the WT this year has already mentioned that we will basically present the season of meeting. [1465. 80-1478. 50] According to the application, the automotive electronics market is still in stock adjustment, but it has reached the end. [1448. 50-1483. 74] Asia continues to grow steadily and demand for semiconductors has increased in the long term.

[1483. 74-1490. 40] The company's automotive electronics revenue was expected to grow in the first quarter of last quarter after Asian customer pull-ups led to double-digit growth. [1490. 40-1499. 24] However, this year's revenue is expected to continue to grow. [1499. 24-1503. 28] Industrial and instrument industry demand is affected by overall economic and stock adjustments, but it is already at the bottom of the cycle. [1503. 28-1510. 20] Expected the first quarter revenue to be flat, and the demand for light communication should be gradually improved as inventory adjustments slow down this year. [1510. 20-1516. 70] The strong demand for AI server growth. [1516. 70-1523. 94] Expected a double-digit surge in the first quarter, and the overall communications will continue to grow.

[1523. 94-1529. 70] The demand for data communications and server AI servers will continue to grow over the next few years, but the short-term construction and pull-out supply season will fluctuate between seasons. [1529. 70-1536. 60] This is not seasonal, and last year's fourth quarter revenue was better than expected by customers. [1536. 60-1540. 20] It currently looks like around 20% increase in revenue for the first quarter. [1540. 20-1546. 70] So it looks like around 20% increase in revenue for the first quarter. [1546. 70-1550. 70] It currently looks like around 20% increase in revenue for the first quarter. [1550. 70-1553. 70] But year company expects revenue for datacenters to continue to grow.

[1553. 70-1556. 40] However, the company expects data center revenues to continue to grow throughout the year. [1556. 40-1560. 20] The first quarter of the PC is a traditional low season, so the expected revenues will be halved. [1560. 20-1562. 20] However, with the introduction of new AIPC products and Windows end-of-service expected to lead to a seasonal trend of business models. [1562. 20-1565. 70] This year, revenues will continue to grow. [1565. 70-1566. 70] This year, revenues will continue to grow. [1566. 70-1567. 70]

[1567. 70-1568. 70] This year's revenue will continue to grow. [1568. 70-1571. 70] The first quarter of consumer electronics is a digit surge in traditional low season expected revenue. [1571. 70-1574. 70] Consumer electronics is a mature market with more AI technology slowly introducing consumer electronics product features will increase the semiconductor content. [1574. 70-1578. 70] The first quarter of this year's demand is expected to remain stable. [1578. 70-1582. 70] Mobile phones are a three-fold surge in traditional low season expected revenue. [1582. 70-1585. 70] Mobile applications are Cash Cloud's stable business, so we expect very little change throughout the year.

[1585. 70-1586. 70] In addition, some of Future's expected quarterly revenues began to surge slightly. [1586. 70-1589. 70] The overall demand has stabilized. [1589. 70-1591. 70] North America has stabilized inventory adjustments, while Europe has also announced a quarter or two. [1591. 70-1594. 70] The second question is whether investors in the United States have increased tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, or increased tariffs on semiconductor imports.

What is the impact on the company? The tariff problem is very complex, and the tariff problem is very complex, and then it is still full of uncertainty, and then it is still full of uncertainty, but basically it can be divided into two levels, but basically it can be divided into two levels: one is the direct impact, then our customers need to ship parts to the United States, or export finished products to the United States, or export finished products to the United States, may have to pay tariffs, or already have to pay tariffs.

In addition, the overall supply chain in response to tariffs or other trade barriers, not entirely U.S., the supply chain will adjust, then the company has a perfect global layout after the acquisition of future, so the customer's production movement adjustment, so we have the ability to serve, we will actively cooperate, we will focus on assisting upstream and downstream to downstream to do the transfer of supply chain layout, we will focus on assisting upstream downstream to downstream to downstream to do the transfer of supply chain layout.

In addition, the company's desire to import AI model internally, and also the company's willingness to import AI model internally, this is the most positive two years, this is the most active in the field of application, this is the most important thing is this generation of AI, the current way of production is, we see the application of generation AI technology, all kinds of terminal electronic products, all kinds of terminal electronic products, this trend must be becoming more and more popular, this trend must be more and more popular, the force is bound to become more and more powerful, this will prompt product cycle, product life cycle short, will lead to increase the content of electronic electronics semiconductors, will also lead to increase the content of electronic semiconductors, so overall, this is a positive effect.

We have continued to cross selling and find opportunities to realize, through the complementary advantages of both products and services, through the complementary advantages of both products and services, we are actively integrating resources, so that existing customers can get a more complete solution, more complete solution. We have also developed a long-term integration plan for the logistics department, gradually improve internal operational efficiency, and optimize the process, through the integration of system integration, standardized operation, and resource sharing, to gradually improve efficiency and process optimization.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request and organize the provided verbatim verb into paragraph verbatim verb. First of all, I want to read the original data of the user to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or duplicates. For example, note that some sentences are repeated, such as "we are now a team" in [2007. 70-2009. 70] and [2009. 70-2011. 70], and need to keep them as they are. Next, I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and make the content easier to read.

At the same time, you need to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that sentences within each paragraph are sorted in chronological order. For example, from the progress of integration to the formation of the team, to the completion of the company's integration, and then the financial outlook, such a process is reasonable. If there are repeated sentences, such as "there are investors asking Future this year's revenue and gross profit margin outlook" appear multiple times, all instances need to be kept, but may be merged into the same paragraph.

In addition, the user mentions "do not delete any sentences", so it is necessary to ensure that all sentences are included, even if there are some duplicates. For example, "start to achieve quarter-over-quarter growth" appears twice and needs to be retained. At the same time, note that the format of the timestamp is correct, whether there is a misplacement, such as [2135. 70-2137. 70], but the user does have this timestamp in the original text, so it is necessary to keep it.

In addition, pay attention to the connection between sentences, to ensure that paragraph transitions are natural, such as organizing the relevant sentences together when discussing financial costs. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to confirm that everything is correct, no omissions or errors, and that the user's requirements are met. Make sure each timestamp corresponds to the correct placement of the sentences, paragraph divisions are reasonable, and the overall structure is clear and easy to read.

Don't ask me about the speed of the integration. Don't ask me about the speed of the integration. We're already a company. And it's very smooth. We're constantly working to improve the long-term return on shareholders' equity.

There are investors who ask about Future's revenue and gross profit margin outlook for this year. There are investors who ask about Future's revenue and gross profit margin outlook for this year. Thank you. This year's revenue and gross profit margin outlook for this year, because we are on the move for a while, so this financial guidance we both give may still be given from a quarter to quarter, quarter to quarter.

In fact, there is a mention of Future. The whole year, if we are in one direction, the first quarter after the revenue rebound, we start to achieve quarter quarter-over-quarter growth. We expect the entire U.S. market inventory adjustment, should be in the next one to two quarters, should be able to gradually reach the end.

So we now see that the gross profit margin is relatively stable in the future. Before there was a mention of Future, its past situation here, in fact, its entire operating lab is relatively high, which means that its costs are really high. But in the past year, since this stock adjustment relationship, income is actually relatively low. So if demand, win-win-time, if it from the whole momentum, the growth of this business interest rate, should be more than the gross profit margin, it is worth looking forward to.

In the first quarter, we saw a trend that started to grow, that is, the growth of the quarter, which is why we estimate a relatively high working capital demand, and we estimate a relatively high financial cost. That is, if we look at the financial figures, we expect the financial cost of the first quarter to be between 11.1 billion and 1.2 billion.

What is the financial cost of the year? In fact, as I just said, it will be a dynamically adjusted situation. That is, if the demand for working capital increases, it may increase the financial cost, but it is also a good thing for profit. Next, investors ask 2025 for the plan of operating cost, as well as the plan of the tax rate. If the cost rate is a relatively long-term record, you will see a fee increase in revenue, usually less than the increase in revenue, that is, as the revenue grows, our fee rate will gradually decrease.

In fact, in our brief, we can see that we look very healthy from the financial metaphor, our finances are quite sufficient, but the specific dividend policy we should follow the actual annual operation of this situation, and the financial situation at the time, we will submit this board meeting with the shareholders to pass this dividend planning. Next, investors asked about the automotive market, the company, the automobile market growth in China, the main benefit of the overall market growth or the company's market share increase.

What are the main drivers of the increase in market share? There are basically two. That is the main head, or the Chinese auto market itself is still growing, especially if they convert the proportion of electric vehicles to the export of electric vehicles, in addition to...

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Other markets outside of China, including South Korea, Europe, and the United States, are in stock adjustment status. OK. Another question here is whether this year's outlook is the need for positive working capital, so will it improve the company's investment planning this year? Well, as I just said, you see that our financial indicators are actually very healthy, so there is no urgency to invest under such a company structure, so we are not planning on this at the moment.
