Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel. Welcome to our channel.

Welcome to our channel. In the case of our products, we run in the cloud, most of our revenue, more than 80% of our revenue is from our high-end power management system, provided to Data Center, data center, and enterprise-class customers. The rest is less than 20%, is from our institutional components, our Racks, our cabinets, then Traces, and the configuration of these servers.

The first Mega Trend is called Rising Power Density, which means that all the customers of the server, their demand for Power is going to be three highs, high wattage, high efficiency, and high density. So you can see, on the screen, this is our Power Solutions product Rollout. We have been the first market for two or three years. We were the first AI Server, Power Supply, and we were the first to launch in two or three years, we were the single PSU, Power Supply, and the cloud 13 kW.

The power drop is placed in the cabinet, which is In-Rack, which is mainly the AI Server of the B series. In the future, we see very clear that we want our Rollout to be a stand-alone power source, the Power Rack. In this Power Rack, we provide in addition to the advanced Power Solutions, we will also add Energy Backup Unit, for example, BPU, and this Super Cap, which will be placed in our Power Rack.

The two of us have been working together for more than four years, and we have been working on one test unit. The test unit is the power supply of the server, and the other is the fit of the server. The purpose of the two of us working together is to create more vertically integrated products. That's when we started working with the AI partner. That's when we started working with this partner, which gave us some inspiration. At that time, we told us to look forward to the future.

Beta Center. Beta Center. Its heat dissipation is really key. In the future, that is, now, the air has reached the physical limit. So next, we have to take liquid cold and water cold. So from that time, we started working with our partners.

Our purpose is also to make the whole cabinet. The whole cabinet is tested, good, testing program. So we see, on the screen to see these products, are our own design, our own developed products. This cabinet-based, this experience solution.

In addition, last year, 24 years, we put two of these products, one is Liquid to Air, and one is Liquid to Liquid. The two tested products, sent to our partners for certification, to Verified. That is also fortunate that we were both last year, one is Liquid to Air, Sidecar, and the other Liquid to Liquid, in-Row, and DU.

Therefore, in the Cloud Computing, we are the future development, focus on the three MegaTrain. That is also mentioned, the first is the so-called Rise in Power Density, which is the power that the guest needs. The second is the high watt, efficient, high-density, and three directions of development. The second is the modular design.

It includes Power and Energy Backup, Energy Backup, DBU, and so on. We also write our software, we call this Data. We call this data subsystem. From the second half of last year, you can clearly see that we Data Center, every customer of the Data Center, for this system, is the PSU plus DBU, plus our software, the need for this system is constantly rising.

So, I think in the future, we will go from this direction, these three directions. Well, this is in our project. We are in the part of Cloud Computing. The other foot, the other growth engine, we see this year is from our photoelectric semiconductor. We in the photoelectric semiconductor, to provide invisible light, with the visible light Helio D business unit, we have been in this industry for 50 years.

Most of our revenue structure comes from invisible light. The invisible light is what we see on the screen, such as infrared, infrared, sensor, and so on. This spectrophoto cameras. The invisible light simply says that this is what we can't see.

The demand is still better or better than visible light, overall. We also have some very important locations in invisible light, including this infrared like ours. We also feel that the demand for some new applications of infrared has been continuously rising since last year. It includes new cases like surveillance, security, and AI machine vision.

In addition, we are in the spectrum synthesis, the function of the spectrum synthesis is like a light switch, it is a protective component. It is mainly used in industrial electronic equipment. In terms of shipment, we understand the world. Our whole, several high-end application synthesis, including industrial control, industrial equipment.

It is battery, bms, battery management system. All of these are relatively high-end applications. So I want to say, last year, we also saw this department of optoelectronic semiconductor.

It is mainly due to the lack of light. That is, I would like to mention that it is our IT department. Our IT, consumer, I just mentioned that we are about 57% from our growth engine.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user requests, sorting out the provided verbatim fragments into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read carefully the rules provided by the user to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim content provided. It looks like this is a speech or report about a company's business, involving products such as IT consumer departments, power adapters, keyboards, and other products, as well as market strategies and investment situations.

First of all, I check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence in a row to make sure that there are no omissions or sequence errors. For example, the first sentence is [927. 00-934.00], followed by [935. 00-940. 00], and so on. It should be noted that some timestamps may jump, such as sudden jump after [1023. 00-1028. 00], which may be due to errors in the original timestamp or skip some parts.

For example, in a user-generated transcription, some timestamps may be duplicated or incorrect, such as [960. 00-964. 00] and suddenly go to [965. 00-968. 00], in the middle there is no [9664. 00-965. 00], which may be a typographical error, but the user requests are not deleted, so it is necessary to keep the original. During the finishing process, it is also necessary to check whether there are duplicated or need to merge sentences, but according to the user's request, no rewrite or merge can be made, only according to the original sentence. For example, there are multiple timestamps in the sections of the Costell investment, need to be arranged in order to ensure that each sentence's position is correct.

At the same time, make sure that the format conforms to the user's requirements, using the right punctuation and segmentation to make the content easier to read without changing the original intention or structure. </think> The following is the collated paragraph verbatim transcription (completely retaining all the original content, only adjusting the layout): 43% last year, more than 13% was from our cash call, buffalo business, including IT consumer. [927. 00-93. 00]. That I think IT consumer, in the last year, consumer was more difficult. [935. 00-940. 00]

Because of the consumer electronics-related industry, in fact, in the last two years, it has been relatively hard. [940. 00-947. 00]. However, I also think that consumers probably saw the top of the date last year. [947. 00-95. 00] That's the IT consumer, last year was a very challenging year. [953. 00-956. 00]

So this year we see that its bottom has already seen the top. [956. 00-960. 00]. Like this year, we have seen it in January and February, and it is YY. [960. 00-9664. 00]. So we want to say that we are going up now. [965. 00-968. 00].

The IT segment can give you a little introduction. [968. 00-971. 00]. We mainly provide Power adapter, which is the power supply. [971. 00-977. 00]. Power adapter also has keyboards, mods, mouse keys, to global IT customers, brand customers. [977. 00-984. 00].

The global market share, in IT, is Power adapter and Keyboard, our global market share is 3 to 4 percent. [984. 00-992.0 00]. We are the main supplier. [992. 00-993. 00]. Over the years, we have been in the IT department and we have been doing business goal adjustments. [993. 00-997. 00]

We pursue this high value, we do not pursue the growth of shipping volume. [997. 00-1002. 00] However, we are pursuing the growth of value. [1002. 00-1005. 00] That is, in the IT department, about 40% of the revenue is derived from these high-priced products. [1005. 00-1012. 00]

We are looking at the growth of these high-priced products. This is the first. [1012. 00-1017. 00]. The second, it is called IT, but it must do more non-IT products. [1017. 00-1022. 00]. For example, commercial power supply, for example, industrial power supply.

[1023. 00-1028. 00]. In the commercial part of the power supply, last year they started, our IT department also started to help this system, this LEO, is the low-track satellite power supply. [1028. 00-1039. 00].

[1045. 00-1052. 00]. Second, we will also add a series of customers this year. [1053. 00-1057. 00]. Therefore, in these commercial power supplies, we also get a good praise. [1057. 00-1062. 00].

[1062. 00-1066. 00]. That is because industrial power supply is a very Niche market. [1066. 00-1069. 00]. So we use another method of strategic investment. [1069. 00-1073. 00].

[1073. 00-1081. 00]. It can be said that Costell is a Japanese listed company. [1081. 00-1086. 00]. It is also the largest manufacturer of industrial power supplies in Japan. [1086. 00-1089. 00].

[1089. 00-1092. 00]. And, we have two boards. [1092. 00-1095. 00]. The purpose of this strategic investment is to accelerate our visibility in the global industrial power market through cooperation. [1095. 00-1106. 00]. Because of Costell's expertise, its expertise belongs to that, [1106. 00-1110. 00].

Low mix, low volume, high mix, is a small and diverse production. [1111. 00-1121. 00]. Then it is this special market in Japan. [1121. 00-1124. 00]. That is to say, our past experience is high volume,low mix, which is a lot of production. [1124. 00-1131. 00].

Our strongest market is in North America. [1131. 00-1134. 00] So the two of us are LITE-ON and Costell, and we are very highly interactive. [1134. 00-1140. 00]. We also hope that from this board of directors, we have two directors and board seats. [1140. 00-1148. 00].

We want to start with the board, the two sides began to establish a center of cooperation. [1148. 00-1154. 00]. Included, is, like Costell, the sales of products to each other on both channels. [1154. 00-1160. 00]. That is, the joint procurement, the joint development of products. [1160. 00-1164. 00]

We hope to deepen cooperation. [1164. 00-1167. 00]. Also, speed up the visibility of the global industrial power market. [1167. 00-1169. 00]. So we quickly explain our three main core businesses. [1169. 00-1177. 00].

That's going to go back to this momentum this year. [1177. 00-1180. 00] I think the three institutions, in fact, go back to a relatively good position this year. [1180. 00-1186. 00] Over the past few years, whether it's to focus on gold stone or to fill the crystals, then this Tyro strengthens. [1186. 00-1195. 00]

This year, it's back to a better position. [1195. 00-1198. 00]. Whether I want to make revenue or profit, the overall movement can go up. [1198. 00-1203. 00]. It's probably the internal goal to grow back in the year. [1203. 00-1206. 00].

In addition, our Board of Directors has passed this, which encourages policies. [1206. 00-1212. 00]. This is the allocation we made for the whole year of 2024 last year, which is 4. 5. [1212. 00-1218. 00]. This is the policy we maintain for the second half of this second half of the year and the half-year dividend once. [1218. 00-1225. 00].

So I want to maintain this stable distribution, and I want to promise to my colleagues. [1225. 00-1233. 00]. The above is my introduction soon. [1233. 00-1236. 00].
