All of you, all media friends. Good afternoon. The first one was opened by Zhisheng. For the whole Zhisheng there is also a home system. An idea and an opinion seen in the industry.

Let's get started. We live together. We live in the same country. We live in every council. We share a concept with you. Our philosophy is to work together to create the same age resources.

Because of this, the overall economic change is so fast now. Especially if it's not in a group battle or a group collaboration. It's really hard to face such a change. So it's also since the establishment of the residency system in 2020, so it's been 5 years now.

The whole development. We always uphold the spirit and the concept. The whole concept is also the role of reception in exchange. This part is beginning to come in.

I just shared the habitation system. The habitation system is relatively new in a state. The total number of alliances is actually this year. In fact, since last year, the number of people in the workforce has gradually increased. This is also the main reason.

The number of people in our overall engineering workforce is gradually increasing due to this extension to the main reason. In the industry transformation. From the original operating industry of each company. We enter the semiconductor field. The demand for engineering manpower is getting higher and higher. Quality and manpower are a very important condition to face.

Now the entire league has more than 560 R&D people. This is one of the most valuable and most exquisite states we have now. Chihsan is now entering the 60th year. The average dam is more than 60% of the people's increase in the state. It's over 45 to 47 years of consensus.

The industry center on the device is actually more than 150 years old. It will also give everyone a better understanding of how strong we are in the trust relationship with our customers. It has a long relationship with the core technology of Zhisheng itself is the technology of repressive thinking. Stress is the technology of the book we are now asking.

Focus on the development of its core field. The core technology of homogeneity itself is the technology of homogeneity thinking. homogeneity itself is the technology of homogeneity thinking. The technology of homogeneity itself is the technology of homogeneity thinking.

Pick and place diet-bounder, solder, and so on. We have three of us own different economies to help our clients speed up their development. We have also seen them clearly from 2020 to now. Our integration in this area will speed up the integration of our customers. Especially now we see a big direction for AOI testing.

From detection to measurement, this technology is integrated into the different core technologies of our company. It can create a lot of different aspects of customers. For example, there are many HPC chip technology now. He needs to know what the status of the belt is. That's where he is in the production process. If you can also know the stability of the chips in the production process.

I can create a higher value for my customers. Now the entire G2C alliance is gradually integrating this technology. It helps our customers to develop a more advanced chip for the next generation. This time, we share the entire G2C is in advanced packaging.

The whole advanced package you can also know that we are like Ziva. It is a Supply Chain for Covas. In addition, we also have IC Subtrade and HVM and SYC. We also have equipment in the whole Ziva application.

We have also seen the regeneration of wafers in another field in the manufacture of wafers. In the industry of Recurrent, both of us have begun to step in. We have cut our core technologies into a new way of producing the entire Recurrent. We look forward to extending our application in the years to come.

Another foot in the semi-detached industry can be developed. That's what we're looking forward to. We're going to see the industry. The industry is now what we see. Now it's a topic discussed at the Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley Forum on April 30. What he's talking about is that it's just beginning now.

But I can see that the overall economy is related to US-China trade. An investor in the capital markets in the industry will be worried. But what we see in our role in the industry is a start-up driver. Because we see that now, perception of AI and generational AI have gradually been built over the years.

In 2022, many infrastructures began to be built. So after the construction of the generational AI is completed, it will begin to go to the 20AI of AI. If you are interested in this, you can take a look at his video on April 30.

It is also possible to get a lot of clear knowledge and expectations from the industry. And now it looks like a computer production in the 1985s. The evolution of the era of Internet production. The goal of that step is almost basically the same. So I think you can be more assured of the trend in the medium and long term.

He's not a bubble. He's very clear that he's now in a direction where we're going. We've shared a bit of information about what we did last year at the spell club. It's important to share with a lot of investment friends. This West Golden Corridor in Taiwan is very important.

In fact, we are talking about this discussion now. We are back to last year's overall situation as well. From wafer manufacturing, xianjin process to xianjin assembly. It is the most important town in the world. G2C G2C North, Tucheng, Linkou, Hsinchu, Taichung. We have G2C.

All of these western corridors serve important customers. From square theater customers to customers in Omori. It is a very important object of our service. So we are all using close service. To help customers accelerate. A role in developing new processes.

That's from TSMC. Our very important customer, TSMC, also shared the topic of square 2.0. We also saw it. We saw Ocean's factory from the original FanLoud.

According to your requirements, we will rearrange the transcription into paragraph-based transcription and keep all the original content. ** Always wanted to grow to the goal**. Always wanted to grow to 2. 3D, 2. 5D development, from the original may be Freeship FanLoud 2. 3D 2. 5D development, this trend has not changed, because a lot of them, my customers also want to go up from here to get higher value-added chip packaging technology, they also began to use this technology with wafer manufacturers a little different route. ** Development Direction**

On the other hand, when 2024, we also saw that our Ocean plant began to connect to the T-Light process allocation of the Foundry, he began to do some outsourced action, which can also be passed on to the next issue of factor 2. 0 is more clear, and the next world is diverse, this diversified representation opportunities, what is the chance, we have a lot of opportunities, what is the opportunity, we have a G2C role, we have been working with the Ocean plant for forty years, so we are also a very important partner, we are a very important partner, we are also a very important partner, so all of these circuits are we are working on. ** This development, we can say, we can say, we can be said, this is our last week, our customers revealed in the technical training field, as we are working with with him, I am very much more than specious.

We look at the bottom left side of the right is COVAX, then the top right we see another discussion we have repeatedly discussed is that it began to have a application of SOW in the car, now the car market is not particularly good, but you will also see that the experience of the current car can know that the next self-driving car is also another robot, that it needs more integrated chip on this single chip, it contains what COVAX did SOW also did and did a lot of work done in the process, one-time to do it well, this price is the best to look at a technical forum share, we think the world looks like we have already seen in a knockout has already told it has a MILESTONE is very specific. **We feel that not only COVAX, not only in the SOW, its growth speed, we come back to see ourselves, we are not on the road, we have to explain ourselves, we have to get back to get back to get back to the next next time to the next time to the next time.

This is also the reason why we are facing many of our big customers now, we think we can quickly pace, there are a few examples, by today's law will share with you, the first is now looking at the status of tariffs after April 2 is very dramatic, in fact, every week there are new news out, and even every few days there are new news out, we see ourselves, first to share with you, and most of our own transactions are mainly in Taiwan Fov transaction, so the influence of light is not very much, we look at the past three years, we directly to the United States gifts about 0. 2 to 0.5%, which is very small.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

For example, if the timestamp is continuous, it may belong to the same paragraph; if the timestamp has a clear interval, it may be necessary to segment. During the processing process, I need to make sure that no sentence is missing while maintaining the original order. For example, some of the examples provided by the user, some sentences have a small interval in the timestamp, such as [1363. 66-1366. 22] and [1366. 22-1367. 50], both timestamps are continuous, so it should be combined.

In addition, it is important to note that some sentences may have errors or duplicates in timestamps, such as [1468. 98-1471. 02] and suddenly jump to [1480. 54-1495. 90], which is missing part of the timestamp in the middle. This time it is necessary to confirm whether the original data is an issue, but according to the user's requirements, the content cannot be modified, so it can only be processed in the order provided.

Make sure each paragraph is made up of continuous timestamp sentences with no omissions or errors. </think> We also expect our customers to start fermentation on Final Test. fermentation is also another, good role for us to benefit from capital expenditure. You also know that our engineers on Final Test, we have a lot of staff who can start fermentation on Final Test.

The PCB is divided into two parts, we cut it into two parts, a large piece called traditional PCB, a PCB called advanced process. The advanced process of PCB is called HDI and IC Subtrade. We are in IC Subtrade, and we are also the main equipment with stamps. In HDI, after 2025, after the third quarter of 2024, HDI, due to the influence of China Plus One and Taiwan Plus One, so that many Google Supply Chain moved to Thailand, and we have benefited from the state of Thailand moving, resulting in a lot of new capital expenditure.

We believe that we will work hard to get ahead. From this point of view, the general manager also wants to say, we don't focus too much on technology, we even have to discuss the transparency of the company's own. You should know that ESG issues are our own investment, and these we have to show more clearly to our capital asset friends, to understand us more, rather than to record technology.

In the next quarter, we will share with a lot of our investment friends, and in 2025, we will focus on advanced packaging equipment, 14067 exploration and verification, the purpose is to cooperate with our important customers, discuss the 2030 year, 2030 he will do RE100, 2050 to operate carbon emissions, we must first be prepared, so we may have a lot of ESG issues this year, may be prepared. Then this is to share with you is our regional alliance, we will follow the customers, we will also have to follow the customers to overseas development, he looks, early sailing times, is also like China, when many companies in Taiwan, many of the network China, many of the use, we are the customer, so the customer is where we will be.

That first thanks to the two CEOs who gave me the opportunity to report on this. First of all, I would like to ask you a lot of advice, thank you. The first is a disclaimer, so please refer to it. Next, let's report to the advanceds that we have a rigorous development part of our army. We can be seen that in 1978, when we were full of the market, the free brand GPM was the mold of one of our semiconductors, and the so-called precision manufacturing parts, which opened the year of our GPM. After 20 years, when we returned in 98, we had two major changes in our GPM, namely joining the military with China Eastern Semiconductor in 02, and then the group automation in 05. During that time, we set up our FPD business in 03, and then left the military in 04.

In this case, I am responsible for the production and research and development of this part. Since you may not be familiar with me, I introduce myself a little bit. In the 08 year, our display panel, that revenue is more than 80%, so we become a main business of the machine. In 2010, we were a entrepreneurship in our internal, so the so-called semiconductor business department, the so-called spin off, the establishment of the military secret. In 18 years, the military was put on the cabinet, and then in 2020, we saw three images, the first is our vision, the first is our Framing, the second is our love, and the third is Jason, the third is the store of the high business.

Then, with one of us and one of the most prosperous part of our operation, that peach plays an important role in the foundation phase, a so-called person's blending, and an expansion of so-called production. In the beginning of the so-called 2021, we collaborated with TMN to do the so-called Soltor part, as well as Bondon, and then in a so-called senior part, we collaborated with the part of the press, under the need of that advanced package and a continuous expansion, we did to help our customers.

This is the first time that we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, we have been able to achieve this goal, and we have been able to achieve this goal.

In the past, we have mentioned a new era of food-reduction bubbles, which gradually leads to a beginning of so-called growth in revenue. Next, Mr. Chairman, we have reported that the business opportunity of the peach in the packaging and the so-called growth energies. There are two very crucial opportunities for that trust package, that is, the downward integration of the Foundry, that is, the Foundry and the so-called advanced packaging and testing. We can see that on May 15th, at the 2025 Tech Forum, T-SHIRT mentioned that we are entering a new era of Foundry 2.0.

The other is the OSET, or OSET, which goes up to the so-called development, from the so-called V-CHIP to the FANUP, and the part of the 2D 205D 3D testing, which is also moving forward towards a higher-end advanced package. The main focus of the development of the one we are all good at is the part of a reduction foam. In this case, one of our products can be seen as our 3D NIR Metrology Carrier and our Taino Connector. The main function of the 3D NIR is to do a non-destructive penetration inspection.

In Taino Grind, the so-called check, then the bottle, then the heat dissipation and the point of purchase, in the part of the so-called Banout QOP. The product of one of our corresponding T-shirts, we have worked on the track. Then the corresponding OCE part of the product, their product corresponds to the so-called international IDM Design House, like a consumer electronics like Bocom Bocom Google.

That experience of regeneration is the business opportunity of a semiconductor green system, which belongs to the report function. Then, the military position is to provide the service role of the report function equipment at the end of the material, and then can expand the scope of Christ West's sales of semiconductor equipment, which is the second corner of our Christian West to grow. Then, in that part of the capacity expansion of the semiconductor, that is, the advanced Zhisheng continues to expand, and that the field of regeneration is a new business opportunity in a regeneration experience.

This is the kind of equipment that we need, like the one we see, the AOI, the PARCH, and the so-called FIND. The most important thing about our AOI is to do what is called a flaw, a hole, a scratch, and a check that has no residue. The so-called PARCH part is to do a tough elimination, and a control of the surface roughness.

According to the given transcription fragment, we can reorder the following paragraph transcription:. To reach a so-called win-win realm, in the business section. That is, we want to create a business opportunity and then report with you the advanced report on the changes in our Maori domain. Based on the 2020 Q1 trend, we see that the upward trend is gradually fermented.

The Q1 combined revenue in 2025 saw a significant growth in the gross profit margin compared to that in 2024. Then the main reason was the strategy of Mr. Chen Dong and Mr. Yang to expand the sales of semiconductor operations, and our colleagues were the co-owners of that product. The positive transformation of an industry from FPD to semiconductor and a change in the product portfolio was certainly a significant contribution to the revenue of our partners.

The net rate after our tax return is maintained at 10.7% summarized as the part of our return to one of our military-owned products to reduce the amount of our target products. The products here are also a benchmark for the international manufacturers as well as a benchmark for the major manufacturers in the industry. We need the strength of unity efforts and breakthroughs that we also have the advantage of localization as well as a good customer relationship.

The basis of our company is basically in addition to New Taipei City, Taichung, Taiwan, and Aoxiong Suzhou, where we also reported that we have come here in 2018. This table shows you the advanced reports that some of our related digital atomic sums in Q1 this year are about 4.3 billion. Our gross profit still has been rising compared to last year because of the continuous expansion of our advanced factor values. We can also maintain some of our gross profit and a certain net profit, so we give you a reference to that gross profit or nearly 40%. Then EPS about 1.6% in the first quarter of the analysis of some of the sales products we have with you also reported that we will be more than 70% of our products for Advanced Package.

The main product context is that we continue to deepen our technology and improve later I will report on why we are doing the most important part of the layout we have received. We, as a result of customer relationship, are more and more different kinds of product changes, especially because of the needs of AI.

Nocoda is not just about the appearance of the product or whether or not there is any rupture or Pavico etc. It affects the characteristics of the product itself as a whole. We also want to talk about where the relevant telecommunications needs of this product will be applied to what the relevant telecommunications needs have just mentioned the stage of AI development. From the original perception of AI to the actual perception of AI, it simply means that the micro product now uploads a report to the cloud it will help you to form some papers or some pictures that you want to report.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I want to read the raw data provided by the user carefully to ensure that I understand the corresponding sentences for each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or duplicates. Then, I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and merge them into natural paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic or conversation, and some may be segmented. For example, the parts about robotic operations may require separate sections, while the parts about exhibition information can be combined. Next, I will deal with the digital parts in the timestamp to make sure that they correspond correctly to the sentences.

However, according to the data provided by the user, it must be arranged strictly according to the given timestamp, even if there is a jump in the middle can not add or remove the content. During the processing process, it is also important to pay attention to the correctness of professional terms and company names, such as "HTC", "DiMaggio", "AISO", etc., to ensure that these terms are presented correctly in paragraphs.

After completing these steps, I will again check the original data and finishing results to ensure that the user is fully compliant with the requirements, no omissions or errors. This allows the user to get an accurate, complete paragraph-based transcription to meet their needs. </think> Here is a paragraph-based transcription (completely retaining all the content, without deleting or rewriting any sentences): -- For example, you need to heat up my clothes first and cook my meals.

We can see the image on the left, and now, if we go back again, when the fab was just starting out in the Events Package, it started with Covas S, and it has grown at least three times the speed and capacity. We can now see that the left and right side are all in progress, and it has grown three times to seven times the capacity and speed. The following is the larger picture, they say in the future, in 27 years or 28 years, it has a 12-inch chip, and there are so many belts in it to meet its efficient computing needs.

This picture tells us that this DiMaggio has to be efficient, because it has to be 100 percent of the amount of each belt, it is great, and it is what it wants. You want to see, for example, at the bottom of this line, it grows more than 40 times faster than the speed of computing and telecom, it is a chip it is broken, this one has to be discarded, can not be used, this is not allowed to occur. So how it must be ensured that we use our AISO moisturizing tape equipment to make such adjustments and adjustments. Then the next stop is done, we are currently cooking, and we are producing our client-based DiMaggio Group, which is complementary.

So the shorter the number of pickups you have, the more the number of chips, the more needs to collect it will be multiplied, in order to meet the needs of our terminal customers. So in this image, the image on the left is mainly used. Of course, our main technical ingredients in Junhua are from our high precision extraction technology, as well as AOI precision machining, and the bottom of the automation control, to achieve what we call AOI, without equipment, and bring the needs of the equipment.

So, I would like to point out to you today that we are looking at the second half of this year and the second half of this year. The above is written, in what we now have, the information our clients give us to assess, then we expect that the advanced manufacturing equipment will continue to grow. We are now more able to confirm that the revenue generation in the second quarter is likely to grow significantly more than in the first quarter. So far we have not received from our customers, the main customers have told us that there are any adjustments in their strategy, and we will not be able to make some major product technology changes due to changes in exchange rates or tariff policies, etc.

From tomorrow, we will be at a CBC exhibition in Southeast Asia, which is our name in Taiwan. We also have an exhibition on May 27 in Texas to the South. If you want to enter the past, you can visit.

This is the report of my army here, thank you, tomorrow. Thank you for the wonderful presentation of G2C, then enter Q&A, welcome you to invest in advanced questions, we will help first microphone, thank you. management, I would like to ask at the beginning of the talk about the vacuum pressure oven, because I understand that the main equipment on the market should be hard, I do not know what the two looks like.

I would like to know more about the competitive advantage of the company's vacuum pressure ovens and their vacuum pressure ovens, and then we would like to go into them directly to compete with them? That's the question. I'm here to answer that, in fact, this is going to happen, and our customers expect our hot technology to help him do a test of Deploy. So basically it's off-lap wrong because we're on the slope of the stick and the bubble on the mic. So I think we're the customer-oriented, and the customer wants us to invest in this development. I think there should be some thinking logic for the customer's business, but I also need to share with you that hard is a good company, because we're working with the process to solve the problem, and he expects to know that we're hot.

--- (Fullly retain all original transcription content, without deleting or rewriting any one sentence)

There is a heat to give him some new ideas for development. So we don't have to be comprehensive. But there will be a part of us to help him. I'll share it first. Here I want to ask a little bit about it.

He's in the Wafer section and the On-Sub section. They'll use this type of device. Or they'll only use the On-Sub section. We're still in the On-Sub section in the new phase. Of course, customers are also waiting for us.

We have been blessed with all things, and we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things; we have been blessed with all things, and we have been blessed with all things.

That we are professional heat experts. That hard is defoaming expert. I will defoacate. I will do it. But he will defoacate. I will not remember to do it.

So hot-related things. In fact, there will be some differences. The new action is very much in it. Hot-related things. So it is not just to eliminate the problem. This is the problem.

He said, "We are not alone, we are not alone; we are all connected; we are all connected; we are all connected; we are all connected; we are all connected; we are all connected; we are all connected."

There will be a change of needs, so I think we're on top of this hot development, in fact, it looks like we've seen it this year.

There is a lot of fire in the customer, but we are not affected by it. This is mainly because we have a lot of hot products on top. Some of the big needs are on top. Just added a few sites.

One of the best things to share is DeepOp. The other is FinalCast camp. I'm also slowly going up. This is where I think I'm running the team.

This is true, and the cer 해주 is face-to-face, but we David Tal, in fact, in our coronavirus, there is no such thing as a fore Wen. It is natural.

We're all in this together. There's always a ury between us. Our government pun. It used to be quite frankly. It's also a good thing. It looks very good in the first half of the year.

We are also a small number of industries that are less affected by tariffs and exchange rates. I would like to ask. I am currently looking at the second half of the year. Is that better than the first half of the year? There are many new processes and iterations now.

For example, POSOS, SOIC. Expect this kind of time. Then we have a big customer. We plan to go overseas. If we want to go overseas, that is when we expect this revenue.

It's easy to make more money. Thanks. I'll answer the last question first. I'm going to go, of course. That's what you said could be four years from now.

At least, because the first long cover is a year and a half. The second long cover is a year and a half. It's about three and a half years. So the previous picture is probably the same as we just saw it.

That cost comes first. But in fact, we will rely on the competitiveness of our product Maori to put it offset. Try to put our resources in some high-value places, so I think this is the development of the situation is that you actually see the investment first.

Next, I saw the investment. I followed. We talked about it. I saw it a few years ago. President of Huizhai. Take stock.

And he took the cup, and gave it to them, and gave it to them, saying, Take, eat: this is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.

Our G2C. Just one thing has been mentioned by the G2C people. Our R&D staff has increased by three levels. But this is only an increase in the number of people. Our three levels are almost all Taicheng Finance.

I think that value will be very different. That's why I look at it from a talent point of view. I also want everyone to look forward to the future. We have the opportunity to copy the vision of our president. Our capital expenditure is the expense of our talent. Our talent expenditure is the income of our young people in Taiwan.

So I think it's also a good thing to do social welfare. Increase this income to increase this benefit. Then catch this track. Let's be able to become. In the next generation, we can stand one. A better stage.

I think that's the first thing. The second is mentioned. Different forms of packaging. Just speaking. I think we just said non-waiver phone. In fact, that non-waiver phone part.

It's a way to increase efficiency, a way to do it, but in fact, we speak of faith. In fact, I think it's really hard to understand faith, so we're also very close looking at it.

There are a lot of technical forums for the main customers. Many. Many. One of the external explanations. We understand in the middle. It's the overall appearance.

For example, just that one of the biggest. It contains all sorts of things. The East is put together. Soic Sow everything together. It's a complete look at our end customers.

It is like a spear, like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear; it is like a spear.

It's a very heavy burden. It's actually a bit of a stretch. Look back at the next generation. It's a big one.

He knows what is best for him; he knows what is best for him; he knows what is best for him; he knows what is best for him.

"I think it's a good idea," he said, "and I think it's a good idea [to do this], and I think it's not a good idea [to do this], but it's a good idea [to do this].

This is our brain power, I just mentioned that more than 30% of the manpower, can not be calculated, can not produce more valuable content out, he will reflect where, he will definitely reflect in Maori and silver hand. I think it takes some time to share this with you. I think it takes a while to talk about this.
