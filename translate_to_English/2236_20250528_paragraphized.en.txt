This is the first time that we have been in Singapore, since we have been in the precision metal forming technology for a long time, the industrialization with these equipment is basically in the metal processing equipment and robot part, then we have acquired BIGL in Southeast Asia, then China is still in the Hungary factory, and now we have 12 factories, all 2000 employees. This is the company's entire project, in fact, we will be in Singapore, it is still in metal processing part, but it is mainly in metal processing part, it is mainly in metal processing part, we will be in metal processing part, we will be in metal processing part, we will be in the next year, we will be in China, we will be in the next year, we will be in China, we will be in the next year, we will be in China, we will be in the next year, we will be in the next year, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the mold, we will be in China, we will be in the mold, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in China, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the next, we will be in the mold, we will be in the mold, we will be in the new we will be in the mold, we will be in the mold, we will be in China, we will be in the new we will be we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be we will be in China, we will be in China, we will be in the mold, we will we will be in the mold, we will be in the mold, we will be in China, we will be in the mold, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be, we will be 22 Now, according to the state of the list code, according to the relevant regulations in Singapore, we should start it after June 23, which is the process, let it completely from Singapore from here, so that we later do the adjustment of the entire organizational structure will be a little more efficient. Well, after this is the BIGO, now it is probably in the main operating area or in Asia, which is now in North America, there is actually actually a cabinet robot design, there is now a local customer in North America, the main thing is that we are the original factory, the other is in China and Southeast Asia, which is now the status of our whole group's factory.

This is the original old, not the old, is the situation of the factory of the original PTEC body system, which bought BIGO after this is more than these, the most important of these production base is in Thailand, Thailand this base should be its BIGO now the largest operation of the whole body, it has three factories, the main delivery customers is West Germany, the main delivery of the whole assembly of the country is not only the United States, its delivery of the region after the completion of the region is only from here, it is about the global goods are probably out of here. It has a factory in Wuxi, in fact, the main supply of the Chinese market is in West, but it is not exported.

This is actually part of the metal stamping parts, this is the most original part of the processing of auto parts, after the opportunity to welcome you to the Wuxi factory to see, in fact, it is here to do auto industry processing, about half of the stamping department is our own PETEC machine, we use our own equipment to press our own parts to sell, this may have been us in Venus this piece, in the past years have not acquired BIGL before, can see it in fact the operation of the whole group cash flow, it is a very contributing company, the main reason is the equipment is actually our own, and then it in the production management of it really has its performance, this is mainly in the stamping parts, new or not changed, it should be the precision, enriched process, in fact, this part is mainly.

Why do we need to do this? Our equipment is able to press the thick part. Look at it because it can press the thickness of 0.3 cm to 1. 2 cm. Then this device can press the thickness of this kind of thickness. In fact, you can see the market now that you can press the number of recesses.

You can see that there is a possible agreement to raise the golden wind. It may not be so thick as a piece of stuff. It's a thick piece of stuff. It's a thick piece of stuff. It's a thick piece of stuff that we can do with Five Lanking.

It can make you press the finished product. It actually has no burrs. It has no burrs. It follows the smooth surface. Next it is completely smooth. You don't need to go through the burrs anymore. Then wash the burrs and then grind them until you have a way to ship.

There are a lot of companies that are currently in the automotive parts industry. We have a lot of companies that are currently in the automotive parts industry. We have a lot of companies that are currently in the automotive parts industry. On this side of Venus, I put the oil out.

I've lost a lot of QCs, or you're going to have to deal with the cost of the second processing again, so why is this really why?

Its profitability is really quite competitive. There is a small part of it that is doing cold squats. That is to do the tightening part, and then there is to wash that part of the tooth inside. This is done in a small part. This is done in a small part.

This is the kind of wealth that we have in store for those who have earned it, and this is the kind of wealth that we have in store for those who have earned it.

This is mainly because of the combination of steel pipes. You have to do more of the process. You are more complex. Even when there are different processes. In fact, it is usually more profitable. At first, we were doing the car exhaust rod hook.

This may have been possible before. We may have been a little earlier. We may have been a little earlier. We may have been a little earlier.

This is true because this is not a good thing to do because it is a bad thing to do. It is quite obvious. You can see it. It usually has a base.

This is the kind of stuff that is not part of it. It will have a base. It will have something that you have to stamp out first. It is a metal piece of steel. You cut it.

When you cut it down, you put it in a pot of boiling water, and then we put it in a pot of boiling water. Then we put it in a pot of boiling water and put it in a pot of boiling water.

It's easy to deform. It's before the pandemic. We're actually in the area. Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiangsu.

There are a few competitors in this area. That should be said. At that time, they delivered to the customer the product value preservation. During the pandemic, they were difficult to do. But at that time, our colleagues were living in the factory. Even the general manager lived in the factory.

The only thing I did at that time was to say. I kept my order for my needs to be shipped on time. After that time, I practiced it. It was supposed to be the level of the welding process. It should be said now.

We are now in the process of making adjustments and improvements. In fact, we are in the process of welding this piece. It should be said that the yield rate of the finished product is very high, so this piece is now considered the main product. This intangible area should probably extend a production line to do this.

Then come back to this part of the oppression. Actually this is not what we did. The oppression part is what BIGO is doing in Vietnam now. You see it is a communication. It is a communication product with 5G. It is a base station with some communication products.

That's what it's all about. This is what it's about. The future customers of the main BIGO here will be in Korea. This is also the first time they had a sales outlet in Korea.

This part is probably worth a hundred thousand dollars, but it should not be able to make money this year, it should actually mass production should be later next year. That's what they do.

There are some customers. We are gold factory and here in Vietnam. In fact, we have started to have some integration for some of the customer's needs. From gold here to help Vietnam to enhance its craft. So how to design the mold in this product.

After that we were able to produce more effectively. This is actually what we have been working with our customers in the product. We were really fast. We bought it last year at the end of December. The integration meeting was already started in December. So some customers have started working with each other.

That's part of what we really do about HDDIG. Look at it, it's actually the cutting of the A-money. It's done using CNC processing. Because this part of the CNC processing actually does a very high degree of precision they do. Because you give to this HDDIG factory. Especially the first two brands in the world.

You gave him something wrong. So it was in control of production. The Thai factory actually bought it when we first bought it. The Thai factory was the first one we really got the most. A few of our colleagues even went to see it ourselves.

It is not that we acquired it simply above the number. I see the number above the expression. In essence, there is a factory that has seen it in the past. It is there. When we were looking at it.

The boss says this company can buy. Because we see it in the factory in Thailand. It has all the production management processes. Even the purchase management. Along with the production above yield management.

"And We have indeed made it easy for you, and indeed, We have made it easy for you, and indeed, We are able to make it easy for you, and indeed, We are able to make it easy for you.

We even let different people at different times. Point detection site to see it. Click on the next layer of processing. Click on the next layer of processing. Click on the next layer of processing. Click on the next layer of processing.

I may be standing in the middle of one of the production lines. Then I'm talking. I'm talking about the middle of the other. I'm talking about the middle of the other. In fact, we're both standing together in turns. He's probably having a lot of processes. We're after every process.

And they shall say, It is he who is in the midst of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly of the assembly, and it is he who is in the midst of the assembly of the assembly.

It has a coil when it is assembled. There is a coil that must be assembled. This coil is now their own. This coil is actually around us before the first month of January.

This is the power of the future of automotive electronics. This is the list of our customers now. Share them with the needs of their customers.

The two of them are better than the two of them, and the two of them are better than the two of them, and the two of them are better than the two of them.

Last year was a bit late due to the time the customer placed the order. And the number of times there was some higher. So the delivery was a bit slow. And last year there were about three cars.

We didn't get there that fast. But by January, we had two 1000 tons of equipment. Then, about the number of gallons in the month of April went on. There should be another 600 800 remaining until the second half of the year.

We've recently discovered one thing. Recently, the customers of the factory suddenly increased. As for Taiwan's customers, it's probably more. Now it looks like the three large orders we've been talking about recently. The final delivery place should be in Taiwan.

Before us, we actually had a second-hand agent from overseas. That was a client who was recently thinking about it. We bought one of our 600 tons of equipment a few years ago. And after using it, it should be the one that actually heats up the post-presses they need.

His rank is probably better than the current delivery of Aida until a year and a half. We are the ones who talk about the number of re-downs now, and the delivery period should be about eight to nine months. That's why we've recently ended with the price of a PO order. That's it.

After the PO single sign-up, some specifications should be fully determined, and the formal contract should be signed. That is, the last time the single talk is actually the same time. There is a customer in the middle of the south, too. He is metalworking, but he is not actually doing the heat dissipation of this piece, but it looks like they may have some cooperation with the fines.

We also have a customer in Taiwan when we are going to talk about the need for 1000 and 1200 tonnes of equipment next year. We also have a customer in Taiwan when we are going to talk about the need for 1000 and 1200 tonnes of equipment next year.

They are the ones who buy and sell, and they are the ones who buy and sell, and they are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell, and we are the ones who buy and sell.

In fact, your mid-term client Ningde had already worked with it. He did the part of the explosion-proof cover of that battery. Then it was actually that piece. Now it may be that, for example, NVIDIA AMD. Our customers are similar to AMD. The mid-term is similar to AMD.

We don't know what AMD looks like. It's a bit more obvious now that several people seem to be AMD. This is what we're going to probably do now. And then it's because it's extruded after it's formed. He'll have to galvanize it again before he can deliver it.

That said, he really didn't use any material. He squeezed it. He used the material to the mold and you had to have the gravity for a moment. Then this gravity could be the moment that I could press again on our equipment. You might still stop a little bit. Then he squeezed all the material in a moment to the corner.

This corner. Then he may have a vertical 90 degrees demand here. For this reason this is what the Indonesian factory should do now. The Indonesian factory should officially start delivery in July. That's the thing above the joystick of the playstation.

Even Q4's operating costs are relatively abnormal. Because of his research and development related costs, it is mainly in the small building. This piece of software integration. That was just last year, we actually talked to François last year. Because last year, the outdoor machine had some hardware design problems. He had no way to restart it remotely after he went through the shutdown in some cases.

It took a while to change this 1. 0upgrade to 2. 0. The problem with the product should now be solved. By the end of the year and Q1 this year also began to restore that shipment to the United States. The order customer on this side did not run, just had no mechanism before. And then last year did not modify these hardware.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user requests, sorting out the provided verbatim fragments into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I want to read through the rules provided by the user to ensure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed. The user specifically emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to examine them in a sentence to make sure that nothing is missing. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim content provided.

The text fragments provided by the user are divided into multiple timestamps and each timestamp corresponds to a sentence or phrase. My task is to arrange these sentences in logical order into paragraphs while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. It is important to note that some sentences may not be coherent in syntax or structure, such as repetitive or oral expressions, but according to the rules, no modifications can be made and can only be kept as they are.

For example, the part of the security system should be put together, the progress of equity acquisitions as another paragraph, the impact of financial statements as a third paragraph, and the business development plan as a fourth paragraph. This will make it easier for readers to understand the structure of the content. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is correctly positioned. For example, the part of the BIGO acquisition, from the public acquisition closing date to the percentage of equity, to the subsequent financial processing, these need to be arranged in chronological order.

In addition, the user mentions that in the process of finishing the process, there may be repeated oralization, such as "that", "this", etc., these need to be retained and cannot be deleted. For example, "the customer" in the repeating software in the "then the customer's security system bought a lot of different functions" needs to be retained to maintain the accuracy of the original word. When processing financial data, such as "93.05 equity", "96.22" and other numbers must be ensured to avoid any possible misunderstandings. At the same time, the date of the part, such as "April 11", "June 23", etc., need to maintain the original format without any modification.

In summary, my steps are: 1. Arrange all sentences in chronological order; 2. Sub-section according to the subject of the content; 3. Keep the original sentence unchanged, adjust the order only; 4. Check the consistency and accuracy. Make sure to fully comply with the requirements of the user without missing any information while making the content easier to read.

Customer security system integration and analysis report function: Then the customer's security system bought a lot of different functions of the software. Then helped them to help them to help this. After the software integration into our backend system, he could do a complete report analysis is that today, for example, I was in a fire, the person who invaded me was actually a little help in doing all the security platform to integrate them. After the integration of all the analysis reports, you assumed that there was a fire in this field, then you are responsible for this security company responsible for the management of the matter.

That's what we're talking about a few days ago. The airport day was when they said they couldn't say what I found on the platform, and they found an abnormal situation that they assigned to the management company for processing, or they could do something on the system that we designed on the app so that he could report it in a timely manner. After that, the KPI of their management company was about to report on the airport.

Bigo's acquisition progress and financial impact: Well, let's take a quick look at it. We made a public acquisition of Bigo's industry at the end of last year, which ended on 23 December 2024, which was the deadline for our public acquisition. The deadline was 93.05 equity. That's because he actually had over 90% of our holdings in mid-November, and he actually closed the transaction when he was in mid-November.

So the last deadline is April 11, so we bought 96.22 by April 11. The rest may be after June 23, whether it is the agreement procedure between the shareholders with that agreement, or whether it is to say that BIGO has done it in a way that targets a specific shareholder to reduce the shareholding.

That last year's report was likely to show that Q4 had a one-time low-cost buying power, and that was it. At the time we decided to buy the company's evaluation process, we actually found that his net worth was higher than the 11th June. He had a net worth higher than what we expected to buy. I really didn't have a PPA today, and I still had a low-cost buying power.

We also discussed with the conference room this morning, because this half-year report should be the final PPA. The conference room itself will also check, in fact, how much cheap purchasing power actually occurred, may we all end up in that half-year report. That last year, the recognition of cheap purchasing power was about 68,8 billion. Asset assessment and goodwill description: This generally we may have some so-called goodwill when we buy a company, and goodwill is usually that your buying price is higher than his asset value.

When we first evaluated him, he had two assets that would be similar to the asset, one being the value of the client, the value of CGATE for his client, and the other being the value of the operation team. The operation team because all of them stayed, and then CGATE for the customer, because we always felt that this was a little bit weak, so we started to build the price, and we didn't recognize this. So now, in fact, you see that the net value of PVA increase, all real assets. And even the Shenzhen plant, we feel that the value of the Shenzhen plant may not be in the future, and we don't re-value the factory, mainly the Thailand plant and other equipment. This is a suggestion for each of our prices, and we want to split the situation in a single season.

In fact, when he reached Q4 last year, the only real time that Bigo's consolidated table was 23 to 31, which actually had a relatively small revenue impact, which in fact will be more obvious this year, because of their monthly revenue, because in addition to the operation of the machine, they also helped CGAY's federation to assemble. In fact, we have discussed this part of the federation, saying that it is not presented with net amount, but this also relates to it with the CGAY's supply contract, some of which specifies the federation of the feed, to which the stock belongs, actually we are still discussing this part. Even if we change the net amount, the total profit is not to give it some of the federation, this part is not likely to ignore it, this part is still discussed in the discussion.

That part may be what we are planning to do this year, and we are planning to do the CP up to now, which pays off some of the bank borrowings, and reduces the pressure on our own funds. The more obvious thing is that because of that, the value of the cheap purchase interest and the assets that come in, in fact, our net worth is a bit higher per share net worth growth. 25-year plan and business development: Well, this 25-year-old we now plan to raise funds to repay some of our bank borrowings.

Then, on Sony's PlayStation, July 1 should have started shipping. The Okinawan equipment delivered two 1000 tons of Q1 Q2 earlier this year, and we will continue to have some medium and standard models tonnes that will continue to ship. In the second half of that year, about 600 tons of customer delivery will be a little bit more.

If China simply shipped from Wuxi, China, this year's revenue should be about 4,500 million yuan, this year's estimated shipping recognition list, the expected shipping recognition list, but because of the two thousand tons at the beginning of the year, the price he above the price to Singapore, in fact, Singapore sales when there was a price added to the price. Then we just recently talked about the recently booked guests, obviously applied to that AI cooling-related, and then he about the number of tons opened more than 1000 tons, so I think this may be next year's real next year, the equipment delivery may be concentrated on a relatively high ton, because of the current market application and demand, we should be 6800, 8100, 1000, or even the day to the central area to talk about the customer, the planning next year needs to buy 1200 tons of equipment, a lot of the price and profit will be better. And our chairman, he was very happy with the contract with the contract with the contract with him, that is very much the same price, the same price, the same price, the same price, the same price, the same price, it is that we will be the same.

This year, it should be said that this part of HDD, this year, everyone's 32T storage of new HDD is just coming out, whether it is WD or CGATE the first two, that this year, because about a month ago, he has just officially started to do a lot of money, so although we said that we have started to do this for some time, but he really according to the customer to give us the final market guiding principles, in fact, the timing of his real outbreak should be next year, so this year's revenue may not be so high, because last year there is more of the low-level things, although this year's revenue is not high, but this year's profit will come up. So we see them the budget, their budget has been really long, because they have been running this industry for a long time, so we's the budget is very long, we will be able to meet him, and we will see him in December. We are now looking back at the first quarter after the completion of the reference our own BiGO, the situation with our own budget is OK, the difference is because of that depreciation last year at the BiGO when the PBA report that he has a large segment of equipment revaluation, the equipment re-valued in fact, this half-year we will meet this morning, we will make some adjustments, so the amount of depreciation at Q2 should be reduced, some of our total amount of the unchangeable, the ratio of some of the parts will be adjusted again, then the impact of Q2 will be relatively small, then Q1, which may affect the last profit of Q1, that is probably the above, thank you.

We can also sort out the filter fluids here, so it won't be too difficult to rator, we should still have the opportunity to continue to see for example, and then the view should be mainly or in the process of the different metal processing, many building equipment is actually the type of blood fins things, like what message black man is not good in a good way, so because buying this is we locked it at the beginning is a better profit company, so in fact, it may become our ROMA, and will not say anything to see what is really useful to us.

It was booked in January. Is there a difference in the price of 1000 tons? Well, good question, we're on the new street, I'm on the new street, because there's still a price behind us is actually $17 million, about 1000 tons, but because there's something customized after it's adjusted.

The last price is a little higher than this, but the beginning of the year, this customer will cut the price, and then we took the order, we are laughing that after this equipment to call the chairman to go, is the old chairman, wow, that is really bad, because the beginning of the year is not the only one he received, you know the price difference at the beginning of the year I said to the difference to 560,000 US dollars, Maori is not good, Maori is a Maori is probably its gross profit should be more than 30%, but if you say that today is the end of the year is the next year to pay this, this should be very big difference. I have calculated that it is probably in the CNC processing part, is the metal part, about the proportion, should be in the CNC processing part is the metal part, it should be about 30% of its revenue here, it should be about 30% of its HDD, it is about 30% of its other zero raw materials that the processing cost is very low, the labor cost is very low. Please tell your industry part of the YY about how much growth, YY really does not grow, the car should actually say, the car grows a lot, the car is really real, Q1, Q1 even up to now, the situation of China and Indonesia is not good, because of the car is really bad, but it should be said that last year we actually have this problem, you will say that it is not high, but the profit has kept down, we profit even China, if you want to calculate it is more than a year, it is more than a year, I even a month a month ago, I see the gross profit of Venus factory, I think it is more than a few months.

In the end of the year, the robot will look like a person, right, but I just asked, because of the electric relationship how many months, then ask what the discount function is, the discount I want to give you another reference, this should be at least affected, the impact should be about 30 million, right, that conversion to EPS is probably more than 30 million, to return to at least 0. 335, so this will not appear in the second quarter, the second quarter it will be less impact, because we have a part of this is being discussed with the fast market, because it is really valuable, we will be in the factory in Thailand construction and construction improvement, we will also discuss this, because there is something in the equipment, because we plan to be divided after, its assets should go to Thailand, or some part of the division, so we will let it down, but the part of that in that it will be reduced the impact of the device. However, this year, because the robot will have some relatively special plans, because he is likely to be talking about, it is likely that he will merge with another robot company in Singapore, and then go to the United States to go to IPO, that time also comes out, the schedule should probably be set up now, it should be expected that this year, the second half of the year to apply, I personally think it is more optimistic, I think it is 27 years, the twenty-seven years of the year is more reasonable, that it should be more reasonable, that it should be said now, Kabel we are doing a round, that may be with each other before I have a round of value-added, then probably more than half of the decision, maybe Aver has told us that the value-added valuation, the last time, it should be close to 40 million dollars, this time, and this time after its value-added, and then it is very likely we are less than 50 percent, if it is possible that if you are actually a new value-added, if you are with another robot company.

I should be that this year. The control of ownership should be described in this way. Substantial control is now discussed. We are after the merger of later assumptions with this robot company. We have control over finance. The research and development with the software follows control.

This section. Then even after the US IPO process and investment choice. This piece should say that between capital markets and finances. This piece actually has substantial control over us. But I may be above the definition of financial statements. There is a possibility of listing control.

Under the circumstances under which you are in control of the listing, I will become in. Assuming this time. This time. This time. This time, external investors add in the price. It seems that the time is already in control of the listing.

It is also a merger when the listing control. There will be another valuation when the merger is combined. I will be in this valuation. When the intermediate spread of my original input costs, there may be a revaluation of the interest. It is a loss I have recognized in the past few years.

He has to rely on his own market capitalization to cover his own losses. It looks like this year is in the process. We probably will do this first. There are more than 11 new energy vehicles now. That's how we do it.

We all saw the number on that table. I believe it will be back to normal after the second half of Q2. We are now receiving feedback from China. Q2 exports are compared. Because we export to the hub warehouse of T21.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for seven days, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month, and in the seventh month.

It should be because the summer vacation abroad. That is, many foreign countries in the summer vacation relationship. Revenue may be affected by the part of the car market.

Revenue may be affected. That was last year. It's still very obvious. Because BYD hybrid cars last year. We don't do it. We don't do it as a pure train.

The profit of doing a pure train is poor. The pure train dies a lot. We don't do pure electricity. The main thing is to mix oil and electricity. There is only the exhaust pipe to fall out of this thing. That's the one to do.

The so-called platform parts of the oil car and the train. These prices are not as bad as they say the train is. That's how it affects so much. That's how it happened. It was originally the time of last year. It was realized in April at this time.

Operation should be very busy. Because the amount of BYD is relatively large last year. There is still a problem with inventory now. But now it looks like it should be sorted out. After mid-June. It should all come up again in late June.

Yes, it is because it is actually the main oil-powered hybrid car. In fact, its sales are really bad. To say it is just a matter of stock is clear. I also talked to Indonesia about it. Indonesia was a while ago.

Since it actually started last year, there is no good reason for the entire market in Indonesia. The new president has some planning for local tax. There has never been a very clear decision. It leads to actually here in Indonesia. We do not do no diplomacy in Indonesia.

That's it. That's mostly the final factory. About 60% of our final customers are Toyota. Then you'll change Toyota here in Indonesia. How do you say it?

It has always been affected by that new norm. It has never been made clear. So you know that you are more careful about the Japanese. So it has been a little more careful on the policy above the production.

That's why it's really the same thing that Sony did last year. The three bars of molds should have been tested. So it was probably the day I talked to the general manager of Indonesia. It should have been tested before July. The test was sent to Sony's complaint forum to assemble. So now if there is no problem with this review.

It's going to be normal delivery in July. Please ask. This U.S. tariff has an impact on you.

I'm more afraid of recession. But now it looks good. Yes, because shipping is not direct. I don't come directly from the United States.

Because the part is about to be handed over to America. It is a transit warehouse in Mexico that is handed over to Virginia. It accounts for less than 10% before my original PETEC merges. Then BIGL it is handed over to CGATE. Because this side of China is handed over to Low Cost.

It is used locally in China. Thailand is the gateway to CGATE, it is a global need. So it really is back to the United States not just how much you gave to CGATE, it is all back to the United States.

We have a little bit of the exchange rate change, and we are also planning to discuss it too, but it's okay because it's almost natural to take risks, because we have our incomes.

Payment with the main parts. This is the big one: CGATE specified fee. In fact, it is paid mainly in U.S. dollars. So it has a part of the natural safe effect. We also have a part of the cash.

"The two of us," he said, "are the two of us, and we are the two of us, and we are the two of us, the two of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one of us, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the only, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is, the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the

We have a time for you, and you have a time for us, and you have a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time for a time to come.
