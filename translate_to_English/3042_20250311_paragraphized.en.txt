Today, we welcome all our guests, the first investment forum for the underage guide Yuanta Securities. Today, we are particularly invited to the special assistance of economic growth, to explain, let us warmly welcome the investment. Some investors are new to the company, some may have heard or heard twice, we will do a few simple introductions in front of us, the familiar people can let go of the previous part a little bit.

In the past, many of the company's investors came to our company to visit the company, the first question we asked is, in the current market application environment, many are talking about AI, or we talk about high-speed computing, the first question they want to pay attention to is that this market opportunity with this trend, what opportunities for the company, and products are connected. We can see that under this AI concept or under high-speed computing, it will lead to a rapid development of an intelligent ecosystem we talk about, including its many key application opportunities. Then we can see our technology, where we advertise a little bit, that we are actually the first and the world's largest average software vendor in Taiwan.

This is where we are to provide more accurate frequency components, the industry is called real-sale components, and many programs will be mentioned later. These are not only accurate, but also very intuitive miniaturization and high-frequency, because the device to put more and more, so miniaturization of our product or an inevitable trend. We are currently in the company's entire strategy, we focus on the three goals, and these three aspects are also good to remember, because we usually use three A to describe, including the middle of the development of AI powered, it is mainly said that in the present many, whether the terminal device or the data center, etc., there will be a software and functional implantation of this AI, so we have seen a lot of this AI server, and it brings it is relative to a network, it is the specification requirements are more than before upgrading.

In addition, after the data processing, as many of us can imagine out of this name, and the data center service, then we will go to the next generation, it will not be in the cloud to do the processing, it will come back to a middle device, edge computing to do the direct processing, then today will also see a lot of possible part of the phone, some PC notebooks have a demand, it is some AI processing functions. Here we can see the synchronization of this concept, in the current customer needs more and more, because the original data is processing, it is scattered to some of the edges of the device, that the data is synchronized, because there is no significance of this edge computing, because this synchronization function is now a guest rule, it is basically a writing setting, including H11588, and Synchroize E, which is a specification specification, and it is the specification, which is the implicitly led to some of the OCX, which is a demand, which is to us with the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of SXP.

In the presentation, we put a concept, that is, because of the current AI server, it for the company's market opportunity is where, because a AI server it is really a lot of one, we talk about a composition, it consists of Computer Trader, it also contains a lot of Switch Trader, these Switch Trader can be based on the owner's needs to do an expansion, to see if it is to be indirect or integrated, it can actually do the expansion.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim provided in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence.

This requires the identification of logical connection points, such as when the topic is shifting from one product feature to another, may require segmentation. At the same time, keep the correct sequence of timestamps to ensure that the position of each sentence is accurate. During the processing process, I will pay special attention to the correct spelling of technical terms and terminology, such as "Differential XO", "Crystal", "Oscillator", etc., to ensure that they are not mismodified during the conversion process.

In addition, the company names such as "EVCALL" and "raycon" mentioned by the user also need to be preserved properly. In addition, the user's transcription may have some time between the marks, such as after the timestamp 637. 42-639. 42, the next timestamp is 639. 42-644. 42, there is no content in the middle. I need to confirm whether these intervals are normal or if there are missing parts.

Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph-by-text text to check if all sentences are correctly arranged without missing or incorrect timestamps, and the format is in line with the user's requirements. Make sure that each timestamp and corresponding sentences are accurately presented while maintaining the natural transition between paragraphs. In conclusion, the process requires careful attention and strict adherence to user requirements to ensure that the paragraphs are properly organized into an easy-to-read paragraph form without modifying the content.

On the right, we refer to a product design that corresponds to an Offer, which is already already on the client's product to mass production, which I explain to the industry, our product features. The Advanced Oscillator, which is basically a module design with a Crystal plus IC and a oscillator circuit, can be seen that in addition to the current 156.2 25 is mass production, many of the customer specifications are open to 32.5, and even 625MHz in the future design and even 625MHz.

The Oscillator is not as small as Crystal because Crystal can do the design of 1.08, then the Oscillator it will be slightly smaller, then it will be slightly smaller, so it will be from 2520 down to 2016 and 1612 a design trend. The low jitter is also a characteristic of the customer's request now, because it is a low jitter it is also a signal transmission, it is a small signal transmission, it is less, and then the signal transmission is more rigorous, more complete, it will not fall off. The following block it will be used in some infrastructure, such as the Data Center we talk about, then the high-end server and even the 5G we talk about, because these are need to be synchronized and timely, especially the Stability, it is a class of 50 or 10 PPB. Of course, it is a certain price, compared to the above, compared to the Oscillator or even Crystal, it is a few times.

So for us, basically it will continue to drive one of my Oscillator shipping needs, that part of our past is relatively small, and that is to form a market opportunity. In August last year, we had announce, we will be exhibiting in the second half of last year, and the exhibition in which we published this is an Oscillator that AI can not use, which emphasizes that we just said the accuracy and hands, because the current device is more and more emphasized the synchronization requirements, because it has a feature about the hand, that in the case of signal interruption, it can maintain the accuracy of the signal for how long. In the past it may require 6 or 8 hours, the 12 hours, etc., but under the demand of AI such high-speed information, we have seen that the customer specification has been required to maintain the signal without interruption, and remain within a certain precision.

We have a lot of focus on the first half of the car, because the intelligent driving, the intelligent cabin we talk about, and the body control. We will be in the first half, because the intelligent cabin on the right is the same as our cabin, we are in your dashboard with a product around, this part is very similar to the current 3C device, and the customer is very strong, so this is the one we have more than the car in the last 24 years, the goal for us is to grow to the proportion of the revenue is up to 25%, and that is also the 25% is to be reflected in our market share in the car market.

It also leads to the part of the smart value we just mentioned, because there are a lot of OSLATER's needs this year, we actually see the order increment. It also drives the part of the smart value we just mentioned, because there are a lot of OSLATER's needs this year, we actually see the order increment. OK, this is a short-term development, it looks like we can reach a target of more than 20% by 2025 to 2027, because in 2024, our market share or our revenue share of the company has reached this 20%, so we will move forward to the next three years.

OK, our marketing, because we just mentioned the previous 3A focus growth Focus, so we also have to set a product target, such as high-end products is to double-digit growth, that car is the hope to account for 25%, this is our current company and other products of a detailed goal. Then let's talk about the recent release about last year's overall goal, there are some revenue ratio of 20 years and financial figures, where investors can look at this, our product application is probably divided into these categories, including these two years of AI Automotive, and mobile refers to mobile phones, and then Yahoo King is the general network equipment, with NB-related Computing, and other, that is Consumer-related to the number of revenue in 2024, we look at the revenue of 2024, compared to 2023, because of the year's revenue in 2024 is probably 16% YY, which we can see more than the previous year's the same year than the same growth of the same year than that we will be more than the same year, the same as it is the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as our revenue, we will be more than that we will increase the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the revenue, the year, the year, the revenue, the same as the same as the same as the same as the year of Qin revenue, we will increase the year. 7, the more need work is in the gross interest rate, because the first half of last year's gross interest rate is actually more than 30, but in the third quarter of last year's third quarter and last year's fourth quarter can be seen, you say that although QoQ growth, the third quarter of QoQ growth QoQ lost, but this revenue period is higher than the first half of the first half of the year, but our margin is under pressure, which is mainly from the product portfolio with us a lot of a lot, some Crystal consumption of a price, in fact, there are also some competition in some markets, so there are affect our gross interest rate, plus the second half of the second half of last year there are some new plants, a room system, etc., in fact, some costs are going up, so we make our second half of the second half of the year of the year of the year of the year, the year is more than the first half of the first half of the year, the year, the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the amount of the same.

In the last three years, a capital expenditure plan for this year, we have passed the budget, a capital expenditure budget of 10.75 billion in the year of the Board of Directors, and the annual capital expenditure budget of the year was 10.75 billion. The 10.75 billion in the year of the Board of Directors, we can see that the share certificate of the company, the ROA, or the ROE of the shareholders' equity rate, is basically an increase of 15 percent.

In the past, we were talking about MES, a process of Huangguangshike, but now we will use a microwave to produce the process. So this part of the year, because last year we had a small amount, and really customer verification back, the overall product performance is better than a focus of the existing IM, so we also now focus on a lot of high-frequency, we are going to go to this, is a production method of the wafer factory, so this year we will continue to release the amount.

In addition, in addition to the NGV part, NGV actually thinks it is more than twice the amount of the certificate field, it is actually a design and production conditions, similar to the certificate field, because it is now a high-end product to undertake the certificate field, it will also do what we talk about Oscillator, with the high frequency Crystal, it even in the front-end chip of a production capacity, but also to increase, so the NGO plant it has invested, need about 2.6 billion of capital expenditure, is in the front-end Waver, there is some IM increase, the main is whether we are, such trade items, some Chinese local customers, he also wants to say some high-end products, can do a production preparation in China. The last one of the stub is Indonesia Shishui, which was at the end of the 23rd year our board of directors decided to liquidate. In 24 years, we began to buy an old plant, with the addition of some plants, which was completed last year, in the third quarter of last year, we have moved in some equipment, some from MGB.

So now the Sabo plant inside it has been in the equipment, in last year's December, that this year's Sabo plant in it has been in the equipment has entered, this year's goal is that we hope in March, because it has a recent disaster construction month, we want to say that it started in March, in March, it will start to do a more formal mass production, then we will look at its stability, because most of its staff is local, that it takes some time to do the fusion, so it is this year it is, fast that March may slow the second season, there will be a first phase of mass production, then we are hoping that this year's the second half of the year, there is the opportunity to evaluate a target of March.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. But like other venues, it is a demand for last year's start. Come here to check if there is any of its auxiliary lines. So we have a place to stay for salt here. Well, that's what we've finally reported for this year. In 10 years we've calculated that our average distribution rate is probably down to 80%.

That is to put a total of EPS over the last 10 years. So let's take a look at the amount we've allocated in the last 10 years. We've probably allocated 8 out of 10. That's because last year we used a weighted circulation debt to make the additions, our final tax after EPS is $6.55. Then we're always going to distribute 5. 2 pieces of a cash to make the additions.

This part of us would also like to continue to maintain such a consistent distribution rate to support our shareholders for a long time. So if we are to demonstrate today's stock price, it is probably about 5. 2 5. 3 of the order rate. If any investment is advanced compared to focus in EPS, then we will have a ratio. Then we will have a ratio. Then we will have a ratio.

So with the end of the year in 2024, we have probably reached about 10% of the profit. So the company Taiwan ratio is a little lower, the mainland ratio is high. So the base plate is about 10, so we continue to use the goal of 2030 R134 to move forward.

Please raise your hand when you want to speak, and I will deliver the microphone to you. I just wanted to ask if there were some small shipments made of semiconductors last year. Just to say that this year will be enlarged. This big thing is going to start moving on the phone. Or it's just a process of continuing to market. I'll explain this.

As we mentioned in the past, there is a process of MES, and then there is an advanced process. Here we have an incremental part. This is the one that is more biased to MES. That is to say, my product is divided into the front part is chip processing, and the back part is a vacuum package for SMB. The first part is the process of MES.

So one chip consistency is better than an IM process. Then we have an incremental need for this part. So that's where you say it's used. Because it's a front-end process here, after it's gone to the back-end, it can be used on the phone we now imagine, and it also has high frequency. For example, 76.8 96MHz of this product, then there's something like 156.25 high-frequency in the light module.

It's also a process we use in the previous paragraph. Okay, here we stop. Then I just mentioned that we've invested in a really innovative one, called the advanced process. So what is the process? That's not the same thing. Because that's the same thing as putting the current Wave-A-Side, plus the next piece of assembly.

It's also a way to do it. So there's an advanced process like this, and it's still in the development phase of RD. It's not mass production yet. So when we look at our RD cost, it's starting to stop for a long time now, and there's no more specific revenue contribution. So we're also continuing to do this dynamic exam to see if we can make it a breakthrough this year. Read this face up and down, this may be congratulatory or Noble stripe.

The second question is the part of the car networking, the part of the car networking, that is, I am not quite clear, that is, how much is the number of sections we can get in a car right now, compared to the phone or some PC to use the product, its specifications or prices, or whether there is a different place.

There are two questions, OK thanks. For WiFi7, we are not the same as the slide. We are in the last two years, sometimes in the presentation, there will be a page to explain the trend of miniaturization. So there is no one, because WiFi7 is its predecessor is it has WiFi5, WiFi6, and then to WiFi7. So basically we will follow IC Design House, their design follows them. The mainstream is to capture Broadcom, Procom, or MPK, they have a solution for these.

So, for each IC Design House, the frequency of the frequency software it requires will be slightly different. So basically we are going to follow the customer's design for development. So with the penetration rate of WiFi7, although not high, but just mentioned the design of these guests' WiFi7, we have already contributed.

The price of Wi-Fi is basically the same as that of Wi-Fi6. However, due to Wi-Fi7 on some guests, the frequency that he uses is similar to WiFi5, WiFi6. Because some guests are WiFi5, WiFi6 is the same, and then WiFi7 uses high frequency. So some guests are Wi-Fi5 relatively low frequency, but WiFi6, WiFi7 is high frequency.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and sort it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that the user-provided rules are not deleted, not rewritten, and not condensed with anything. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them one by one to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. Next, I will look at the transcription fragments of the user-provided transcription. It looks like that the content involves technical discussions, such as WiFi6, automotive modules, 5G Advanced, AI applications, etc.

First of all, I need to identify the sentences corresponding to each timestamp and arrange them in chronological order. Some timestamps provided by the user may be duplicated or incorrect, such as [2514. 08-2514. 80] and [2514. 80-2518. 00], which need to be verified correctly. However, the user may only have a format problem when copying, so it is temporarily handled as if it were. Then, I will sort each sentence in chronological order and try to merge it into a natural paragraph based on the context. For example, comparing Mavi and WiFi6 may be the same topic and can be merged into a paragraph.

It is important to note that the user refers to "not to delete any sentence", so even if some sentences are duplicated or have errors, it is necessary to keep it. For example, [2514. 08-2514. 80] and [2514. 80-2518. 00] may be duplicated, but all must be retained. In addition, the user's verbiage may have some timestamps, such as [2514. 80-2518. 00] after [2518. 00], there is no interval between [2518. 00-2519. 96], and there is no need to check whether the content is correct. However, according to the user's requirements, it is not possible to modify the content, so keep the original.

Finally, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all the timestamps and contents are properly converted. Once done, read through again to confirm that there is no violation of the user's requirements, all contents are fully preserved, and paragraphs are divided into reasonable.

So sometimes in terms of price strategy, we will look at the relative advantage. If we are a relatively competitive vendor, then the price will be a bit higher than the price at the current stage, to do a hair rate that we think it should have in this high-end product. Another mention is that the car, the part of the car is actually its range is quite large. Because the car is like the first we mentioned in the car, it is a lot of mixed, it may be a combination of electric and mechanical at the same time, to the pure electric body.

It is more abundant if it can be compared to fashion, which is usually used in this type of car in the plane will be more than 60 80. If it is compared to the high-level level, it may use 100 is also normal. Just say why EV Car is going to use more, because many of its body parts are using Module to assemble, and then we mentioned that because it is able to achieve intelligent driving, it is necessary to go from the current level 2 to level 2 to level 3 level 4, which is not the car itself, because in addition to the driver's car it has its own department, it is with other vehicles, it itself with the next to the wearer signs, and it can be sensitized. So it will use a lot of the technology and quantity of this Camera Module LiDAR we talk about, so it will probably have a lot more than the conventional fuel car we talk about.

Of course, a lot of AI technology is also discussed in the body, we just mentioned whether it is the United States electric vehicle factory or the land electric vehicle factory, they have their own chip, its own chip platform has a product for the body, in demand related to a private. This part we are also certain that we will provide further, as well as 5G if we will return to 5G, now we will talk about 5GA, because it is a little bit of the next Generation to go, so we will put it in 5GA, we will buy it at a full price, including the AAU and DBU products we mentioned. Because these big customers are mainly China and Europe, the limit manufacturers of the European manufacturers, in the last two years they are not very good, because of the overall mining run, they have a lot of the strength, is seen in the last two years more customers in this kind of such infrastructure, so the last two years is a continuous inventory.

For example, as we mentioned in the router or switch, it has a low-level, which will stay in the networking. I would like to ask the car key and AI current visibility of the order, and the second problem is that it is currently only available. In order to order visibility in March, because it is now in March, our vision for Q2 is that the car and AI orders are relatively clear and stable, which is more likely to be a May order is relatively Firm, and the other consumer phones that the current entry speed seems to be a bit slower.

So sometimes, even though there are only 80% of the material in some key materials, for example, there is an Oscillator in the car we just mentioned, it will basically use the TCXO capacity in the mobile phone, so sometimes there is a bottleneck in the production capacity of a particular machine. The company just has a page for a production capacity in 2025, we have a basic expenditure for these special equipment, if there is a system that can be squeezed internally, it will do a gamebook for that kind of device, because even if it is the same customer with the same specification, if there is a slight change in the number of code after the number, you will see that it may be the same series, but it is different, to say that the customer has some characteristics above to adjust its material, we will basically use the product cluster to see the class of Crystal, so it will be converted, so it will be Crystal and the crystal and the most useful. It is a little more diverse because it has too many product specifications, so it will look at the customer's application to do the design, so there is a constant temperature OCXO or PCXO with the following general CMOS, each and every one of the following, if it expands in detail, it is very expensive, so sometimes we can not use the data consumption, but if investors are interested in it, you can see that my PCXO is also used in the car because it is very straightforward to use the GPS function, so it is that PCXO is useful in the car is actually at the beginning of our company's data consumption A series, and this AQ is only a group of data consumption It is a lot of numbers behind it.

Our mobile phone this year is relatively conservative that this year there are more products coming out because of the use of more content to see or because of the decline in prices, there are a few are actually in the mobile phone this consumer product price pressure, because this is probably from the second half of the year, two years to this year, the business has been on the market feedback there has been a price pressure in the mobile phone that has been felt in the past, of course, different customer handling is also different, because we have a mobile phone we have a beauty customers, we also have Chinese customers, we are with the Japanese counterparts to do the competition in this area, we see the price of the Japanese industry is very low, so we will focus on the parts we can increase share together to see because some of the fact that we are more than the Japanese industry is a high gross profit because we see a cost of the cost of food consumption in the Japanese industry.

If we are sure that we can make a relatively marginal comparison, then we will take an incremental approach to fight. On average, the material consumption rate is low, and that part is that we maintain the share rate, and we do not specifically fight. That is to say, this material consumption is not the next half of the customer's model and the next year's model will continue to use the material consumption as an evaluation standard.

This is the mobile phone, why this year's mobile phone look relatively conservative, of course, is the market price above we really have some considerations, so we can not say is the absolute amount of YY increase, but we will have to master some key projects. Then again, the customer's product design, some models in this year's design, he has to add a product called MENSE, for example, just mentioned that we have a joint sitetime, some of his MENSE products have a solution for more output. So if the customer uses such a design, it will be cheaper to correspond to my crystal, but my crystal may need to use two or three to achieve these output ratings. But if the customer chooses a product above the model, that part of my quantity will also be affected.
