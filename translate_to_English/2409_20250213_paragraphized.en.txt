Below is a re-edited paragraph-by-text transcript: Dear friends, today we welcome you to join AUO's corporate briefing session for the fourth quarter of 2024. Today we have a total of four presenters, including Paul Pang, Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer, Frank Co., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Chen, Senior Vice President of Display Strategy, and David Zhang, Chief Financial Officer.

We have collected a number of questions from legal persons and will respond to the current question. After the reply, if you have any questions, we will open the Q&A on the live event. The above is the meeting process for today. Before the Chief Financial Officer's report, I would like to remind you that any forward-looking forecasts in the report are risky, and please take some time to read the second page of the slide Safe Harbor News.

First of all, we saw the total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 reached 687 million, so the previous record reduced by 12 percent. The main reason is because the demand for stocking has already announced a paragraph, the consumer financial needs have fallen to 687 billion. That is because the demand for finance has slowed, so the overall shipment volume and revenue has declined.

However, we see China's auto market benefited from the promotion of auto policy and an increase in sales overseas, which led to a decrease in the overall shipment offset part of the revenue. Next, let's look at Vertical Solution. Due to the impact of early stocking and market dynamic slowdown, and the demand for solar modules in the fourth quarter was less than expected, resulting in a decrease in revenue from Vertical Solution.

In the fourth quarter, operating profit was 4.7 billion, margin dropped to 6.9 percent. The overall EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.200 million. Next, we saw a 2024 full-year profit of 2.8 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to the previous year. In addition to the positive contribution of BHTC's revenue in the second quarter, the market was dominated by an uncontrolled temperature, and the market was more orderly.

The growth of the company's operations has been the highest, and the demand for automobiles has increased, and these factors have resulted in an improvement in the company's operations in 2024 compared to 2023. Gross profit is 2.4 billion, operating profit has been reduced significantly to 8.5 billion, loss attributable to parent company all year round is 3.1 billion, operating profit plus DNA is 2.5 billion, margin is 9.1 percent, and loss per share is 0.4 yuan. Next, we look at the balance sheet.

In the fourth quarter, the cash flow of moving loans came in at $8.8 billion, where the depreciation of the quarter followed the sale of about 8 billion dollars, the cash flow of investment activities about 6 billion, of which capas is 73 billion, the cash flow of investment activities is 2.6 billion, mainly the net increase in bank borrowing. Next page is the company's three main revenue pillars accounted for a percentage of the company's consolidated revenue. First we saw the display this quarter's revenue ratio decreased by 1 percent, mainly by the low season, the demand for consumer products slowed down, and TV monitor and notebook shipments are basically reduced. Then we look at this quarter's revenue, we see that part of the quarterly solution also declined 1 percent, mainly because the customer's early inventory and market momentum slowed, plus the decline of the fourth quarter solar module.

Next, I will explain to you the company's business outlook for the first quarter of 2025. First, about the mobility solution, the impact of the first quarter and the seasonal factors, the company expects revenue to decrease high single digit percent compared to the previous quarter. Second, on the vertical solution, the company expects the smart vertical and commercial panel of the first quarter to warm up substantially.

Thank you David. Next, we ask the Chairman to share with you the company's strategic direction and outlook for the future. Hello all, I am glad to have you here face-to-face with us today.

The whole industry has begun to respond to more orderly conditions. Display last quarter is a traditional low season. So QoverQ is a decrease. But at the end of the year, there is an old replacement or energy-saving subsidies.

So we created the whole, especially large-sized TV, this very warm demand. So we saw the condition of the entire display. It is now on top of a good growth in this momentum. That Mobility solution?. The fourth quarter also slightly reduced a little.

But this is also in line with our expectations. The only one is the Vertical solution. Because of the impact of our energy. Because of the policy, we have dropped a lot in total. Especially in this commercial marketplace.

The overall environment is uncertain about the economic environment. Therefore, we all invest in the enterprise. Corporate spending has not returned to this situation of this relatively smooth spending. Therefore, there is some impact on energy and commercial products here.

But the commercial one will be much improved. That's 2024. Although the whole world. Whether it's normal or normal. The entire economic environment is very volatile.

But AUO's transformation strategy continues to be fermented. Plus, we're starting to merge into BHTC in the second quarter. That, of course, leads to our overall revenue. It reaches 28 billion billion. 13 percent more than in 2023. That's just growth in revenue.

Let's get into it, too. This area of Tier1 so-called cars. And then there's the addition of this layout for global manufacturing and sales. Of course, we complement the advantages associated with BHTC. This is also gradually in fermentation.

I think everyone should see it in the next few years. This growth we have in the automotive sector is very impressive. So 24 years I think that the HTC is really going in the right direction. That's what this Mobility solution is all about.

We only see it now. In addition to this energy business. Energy business in Taiwan. Overall. Influenced by energy policy. Solar decorations in Taiwan decreased by 40% last year.

That's right. We've had this revenue drop for a while. It's about a quarter of a century down. But I think we'll continue to fight for more cases. The fourth quarter of the year, of course, the revenue drop. So this loss is slightly bigger than the previous quarter.

That's why we have a net profit in the fourth quarter is positive. The gross profit margin of that year is also much better than EBITDA in the last two or three years. Of course, we have always wanted to be able to correct it in the industry.

But we still can't make it through the year. But we will continue to work hard. The company's overall financial structure is very solid. The stock balance in the fourth quarter is flat. The level of cash is the same.

I think everyone is more concerned about 25 years. 25 years. In fact, the political and economic environment is honest. Maybe not much better than 20 years. Especially now there is a big variable.

"I am the Lord of the harvest; I am the Lord of the harvest; I am the Lord of the harvest; I am the LORD of the harvest; I am the LORD of the harvest; I am the LORD of the harvest; I am the LORD of the harvest; I am the LORD of the harvest.

This stimulus to 3C products is ongoing. Of course, there is also a car. So the first season is of course the traditional single season. We think that this year's trend should be upwards by season. So back to a relatively normal season change. That part of Display.

The first quarter has declined slightly. But the second quarter should be back to normal. Because the start of the second quarter has forgotten that this stock has begun to be prepared. The Mobility solution will look at the global test condition. But the mainland test is good. The rest of the European and American regions will see how much impact this continent has on them.

I'm currently. ah. **Note: Since the original text contains a large number of duplicate sentences, the finishing paragraphs may contain duplicate content.

CES is an exhibition of cars, which we can all offer this solution from the inside of the car to the concept of the future of the car. And of course, the board of directors passed last November 21, which was to add the whole car AUO vehicle with BHTC, we set up a company is AMS C. The main purpose was that we wanted to turn it into a corporate division of the division, then the future of our three pillars are actually three companies, then the distri AUO, but this mobile solution is the AMS C, then this vertical is the center of the dam, and then a few of our smart solutions companies. So in the future of these three pillars, whether from operating performance or their performance, we can do better under this company, which also gives us a clearer goal below the companyization, and then everyone strives to that goal.

So, in the future, every operation will have a very clear goal, everyone's efforts in the direction, and show the performance of the way will be very clear, including how many resources you use to create revenue, how much profit, will be shown in each batch. Of course, in addition to these operations, or our improvement, I also want to tell you that we are doing a lot more in this company sustainability.

In this regard, we have this 2050-year-old carbon emission rating, which is the 2050-year-old carbon emission reduction path, which we have to share: we have published the industry's first natural-related financial disclosure report, which is what we hope to share: we hope that in all of our operations around the world, we will know more about this impact than we have to know about this.

In addition, I am here because we also have a resolution in the board today, and then there is a announcement: the first is to focus on our operations, and we will include our assets to better use, if not it is not its high efficiency, we will do revitalization, so today, we announced that we are in the center of the scientific park in the thick of the original AUO wonderful, our 100% subsidiary AUO wonderful, we sold to the UMC company, the last time we had a west test sale, so the whole addition would be 37.500 million this sale. At the same time, because this AUO wonderful company, the original business of AUO is the monocrystalline chip of solar energy, with the materials of semiconductors, today we also decided to have its solar monocrystalline business to stop, we will keep the semiconductor business, and then we will put it in our factory to go to go to go to the factory, so, so we will return to the next year, and we will also the next year, we will also the next year, we will support the next year, we will also the company, this, this, this year, we will also the next year, we will also the next year, this we will also the company, this, this is this is the next time, this we will be the next year, this we will also the next year, this is the company, this we will also the next time, this we will also the next year, this is this is this is the company, this is the next year, this is the next year, we will be the next year, we will be the company, the company, we will be the next year, this is the company, this is the company, this is the company, this is the next year, this is the next year, this is the next year, we will be the company, we will be the next year, we will be the cash, the company, we will be the next time, we will be the next time, we will be the next year, we will be the next year, and we will be the company, the company, we will be the company, this, this, the cash, we will also will also will also will be the company, we will also will be the next, this, this, we will be the cash, we will be the company, we will be the cash, we will be the

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. The 100-inch is now much more on the market. So as the size increases, this consumption is very fast for the major generation line. And then the industrial order is also better. The so-called on-demand production, according to this demand, this piece will bring the entire industrial order back to a good cycle.

This year's TV sales should be more than an average of more than one inch. So as a concept, each inch is about a 8.5 bag of production, so this consumption is still very large. In addition, of course, in the IT industry, because this Win10 to stop service and AIPC to bring these machine trays, there is also the increase of these purchases during the epidemic.

The other one is Win10, and you can't upgrade to Win11 based on the statistic of the brand's customers, which is changing every year. So we see the entire IT industry in these few drives, including the AIPC drive, and we think that this demand will rise significantly over the next two years. Of course, I still want to emphasize that the tariffs on geopolitical wars exist, or there are some uncertainties, so we still have to look closely.

Another reason is that the operation of our three pillars will also give us a clearer goal. Speaking of AIPC, we launched a lot last year, but did not cause a very hot trend. But this year the first is brand customers, the first is the brand factory launched a lot of AIPC, this model is a lot. The second is actually a major announcement during the year, called Deep Sink, which can be done in a simpler way.

So this graph shows that the demand for our AIPC is a very steep demand, and of course it is very concerned about energy consumption. So we have been leading the way with low-temp poly, especially low-temp poly plus touch. On the right, you can see that it is energy consumption, whether it is in the use of energy consumption compared to OLED, it is significantly reduced compared to OLED. So for example, its battery usage can be nearly twice as much as the PC of OLED panels.

That's why we have so much to look forward to. So just what I've reported with you is that we have some changes that we can make in the 24th or 24th quarter, and there are some better things we can do. We also have some new layouts and development in the 25th year, especially in the operation of the three Ps, and then our resource allocation will follow the three pillars for better deployment.

This is my first report, and I would like to share with you what is important about the other two pillars? Then I would like to tell you about the more detailed part. Thank you very much. Hello all media friends, we have invested in advanced afternoons. Paul has just explained the overall structure and strategy of AUO and the progress of some of our important displays.

I want to start by reporting to you, one of the main content and results of our CES in Las Vegas in early January. This video you can see what we're showing here. But before we start, I'd like to report to you that this time we had a business sense of being AUO and the first time that we've worked together on some of the results we've developed in the past half of the year. I think this time we've just said that we've really got a concept car, and that's not about showing the smart cabin in the car, and that's why we're here behind the innovative technology is Micro LED.

This time, our main Smart Copy cabin was designed with Micro LED technology to present the possibilities of the cabin in the future. At the same time, we also combined the solutions of BHTC in the so-called automotive HMI, including the structure of the HMI, which includes the various control capabilities of the human-machine interface, which we believe will be able to integrate into the smart cabin in the future.

A transparent screen with no boundaries. We call this image glass. It's actually a combination. It's a dashboard commonly used in our general cars. The entertainment display function of the midrange driver's seat is also available. It turns into an all-in-one panorama.

It can be either a display or a head-up display. Normal car display and head-up display functions. So both entertainment and this information. At the same time, you can see the outside road conditions with a transparent display.

The same time we are on this steering wheel. It is also a foldable steering wheel. With the future of this self-driving trend. It is a use case. The same time becomes a forgiving Micro-ID. The display is combined on the steering wheel.

We call it the panorama of this fantasy. That's basically the world's first. We put a large size. The roof is transparent Micro-ID. It's a combination of the skylight.

On the right is a transparent Micro-ID. It is a combination of windows. The concept is actually put. We are talking about this cockpit. It is the third living space of man. It is not moving in the car.

We have a lot of ideas to offer. It includes a movie you can watch. You can go through something like this. A smart window with interactive AI capabilities can then be combined with this path next to it.

That's where we combine Touch. Then we combine this Age AI feature. There are many other entertainment simulations that can be done. Even some of the guides. Then the various functions of the tour. That's the same time we're exhibiting this time.

We also work with our ecosystem partners. We work with the world's leading window glass manufacturers. We combine them directly. We also have the characteristics of dimming. We can also provide safety and privacy.

Well, look below. This is the lower right corner to the middle. We combine Micro-LED. The so-called extensible and forgiving two features. Coupled with the design ability of the BHTC in the body and the shape of the body. The lower right corner is called Morphin's Central Control.

This device. In fact, it is the surface of the seamless inner paper. Then add the structure behind it. So you can imagine a display that can be danced. This button will be dynamically displayed. And then this button.

This button can be programmed. This screen changes with Micro-LED. It can be changed to be controlled by you at the same time. Drive the gear. Control the video entertainment. Or other controls.

So it is basically a display and mechanism. A completely integrated new form of control interface. So this is also AUO's display technology. The control is fully integrated with the BHTC. The middle is, of course, a common control interface.

However, it is possible to shake through the Micro-LED. Basically it can be the edge of this shake. It is also an intuitive control interface. So this is what we are showing this time with BHTC.

There is also a new product that combines the ability of the agency. It is also very well received by the manufacturer. It is in the bottom left corner of this. I think it is also worth reporting to you. This is a design agency we have developed together with Sony Honda Mobility.

The car they call Ophelia. It will be available in the U.S. in the second half of next year in 2026. The head of that car. This car outside the display. They are called MediaBar. This display is the product of Micro-LED provided by AUO.

So you can see clearly. In 2026, AUO's Micro-LEDs will be listed in the US with this car. That's also our monitor. We invested in the fourth and fifth generation of Micro-LEDs last year.

The main product will be mass production. Good. So the product is finished. I would like to also report from the business side. Overall, I would like to say that we are exhibiting at CS.

Showing two important things. One thing is for sure. AUO merged with BHTC. It was a one-team show. We were on top of our products. We just talked about innovative products.

On our products. On our products. On our products. On a set of products. On a set of products. On a set of products. On a set of products. The second is a combination of the strength of our customers.

We exhibited this year compared to the number of car factories visited last year. It increased by 40%. The important thing is to visit the car factory. The increase was many times above. It probably increased the past three times. So basically the customer recognized us with the car factory.

This re-integration of the innovation status. And this also shows that we speak directly to the manufacturer. The combination of a variety of orders for an opportunity. So this is what I want to share with you. We are such a result in CS.

Then, of course, the car continued to move to the various factories after the show. It was an opportunity to exchange and innovate with each of the factories. Next, I would like to share with you this slide. We are on the business side of Mobility Solution. In 2025, at the factory.

Looking ahead, there is a strategy for the future. That is, of course, where we completed the BTC merger last April. That everyone was very concerned about the results of the last few months. That was in addition to just technology and customers.

Our Board of Directors will set up a new AUO Mobility Solution Corp. This will put all of our vehicle operations in place. Then we will accelerate the integration and scheduling of all aspects of vehicle management systems and R&D resources. Then build a more efficient supply chain and improve our overall competitiveness.

Technology integration capabilities. Let the factory move forward with the ability to integrate. Let the whole factory and the automotive industry be more comprehensive. We can serve them more comprehensively. We estimate that by 2025, the market for this year should still be.

That of course is the growth rate of electric vehicles with the new original vehicles. That is back to our friends. We look at ourselves. We really don't have enough of this car only the number of panels to grow.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into a consistent paragraph while retaining the original order and content.

First, I will read all the sentences and understand the overall content. It looks like this transcript mainly discusses the company (or AUO) content in terms of revenue growth, product portfolio, M&A impact, automotive market strategy, and vertical solutions. Next, I need to determine the logical relationship between each sentence and see which sentences can connect naturally. For example, at the beginning of a few sentences, it says, "We're more concerned about the growth we still have on the amount," and then "So," it's about the acquisition of BHTC content from last year's overall situation and the South Bay.

The following paragraphs may be related to the percentage of revenue growth, AUO's own revenue target, vehicle revenue growth, etc. You need to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, but users are not required to retain the timestamp, so you can ignore it. At the same time, make sure that you do not miss any sentences, even if some of them look incomplete or duplicated. For example, there is a "here" in the middle, followed by the improvement of the product portfolio, which may need to be merged with the previous and subsequent sentences.

For example, in the context of the Vertical Solution section, the user mentions two sections and separates them to ensure that each part of the information is complete. In the process, it is also necessary to check whether there are duplicate or redundant content, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so even if there are duplicates, it is necessary to keep it. For example, the amount of "take a case" and "results of revenue contribution" may be merged into the same paragraph. Finally, after the initial draft, a general read check is required to ensure that all sentences are correctly classified without omissions, and the transition between paragraphs is natural.

As a result, we acquired BHTC in South Korea last year, beginning with revenue from the second quarter. That summed up our revenues in 2023, 2024 compared to 2023, and we had 62 percent YOY revenue growth. If you don't remember the BHTC revenues in the last three quarters, just look at our own, and our revenues in the last year exceeded our five billion-year revenue targets.

We believe that this year, we should be able to maintain the revenue growth of Low to mid-teens. That is, I think this is because in the past few years there has been a lag effect of taking a case to revenue contribution, and the case you take now may take two or three years to contribute to revenue. So we pay a lot of attention to how many cases we have now, so here is a report with you, the total amount of cases related to the car that we have accumulated in the past three years, AUO and BHTC, the total amount of which is more than $15 billion in three years.

That's why we have the confidence to report that we can maintain double-digit year-on-year ungrowth in the coming years. Well, that's just what I have to say, after BHTC, AUO is a very good time to combine the industry with the ability of the industry to provide the panels with a good TA1. So, the whole AUO future product line will be from the left hand side of this slide, and maybe in the early days AUO will focus on selling the panels module. In the past few years, we have gradually moved to the so-called Display-Centered HMI to display the core human control interface as a smart cockpit product.

So you can imagine this revenue from the left to the right, and the value of each product is growing several times. That is why it is also an important source and foundation for us to support the growth of revenue which will exceed the average car panel annual revenue growth of 3 to 4%. Well, let me report to you this part of the Vertical Solution.

This is a green solution that we have already made with our solar and smart services. First of all, we have to look at this piece of SmartVertical, and this year we have seen that although the growth of the industrial and commercial panel is not very good, we have actually made a 20% annual growth in the smart retail smart medical smart enterprise. As the share of revenue continues to increase, we believe that this year we will continue to maintain such a strong trend.

So this year, we will focus more on this one, to this foreign market combined with this solar panel and building materials combination, and we will provide more products and solutions for small-scale partners in this solar mall, and then to maintain a development of our solar energy.

Then he went on to test the wafers and the fields associated with the phosphorus impedance. Then he put the original in the past. Historically.

Other areas. Then continue to work with key customers to seek revenue and continue to grow above profits. So overall. Vertical solution has a temporary reverse wind of the solar business just mentioned. But overall revenue is in the business. Smart vertical solutions and smart services.

Green solution is driven by the growth of smart services. We see it. It will last for years. The load growth rate. At the same time, we also see the need for industrial panels from Season 1 this year, and we start to warm up again. So I think we can see it from Season 1.

The growth of the QoQ of this piece of smart vertical solution. That's a rumor. That's why I ended up focusing on the three pillars above. Combined with Paul's report, I summarized it. That's what I'm looking forward to in 2025, and I think the supply and demand of Despair's overall industry should be.

Healthier than the first two years. Yeah. A lot of this new need should be. There is also a situation that includes a pandemic or a switch that should lead to a better process. Our goal setting is to pursue it.

The profitability of the Despair business is stable. And there's continuous improvement in our operational efficiency. That's where Mobility comes in. We'll accelerate our integration with BHC. synthesis. That's what keeps us up to date with new projects.

The amount of money we get. Of course we see the external environment or inflation this year. Tariffs still compete. These uncertainties of war. We set up Mobility solution revenue this year.

There will be a low to mid teens one. The percentage growth. We will also maintain double digits in the next few years. Such a growth goal for the compound annual growth rate. That third pillar of Vertical solution.

Here's the solution. We have this smart service. Driven by. In 2025, our revenue was more than 10%. The goal of revenue growth was to set a double-digit annualized growth rate in the next few years.

That's all I've done for two of you. Peter's report. Thank you, Paul, for sharing with Frank. We'll answer the questions we've already asked. The first question is financially related.

Is it possible to provide guidance on the company's 2025 depreciation amortization and capital expenditure. Will there be a significant decrease in capital expenditure and depreciation in the coming years?

That. This is basically the same as this guide that was given to you before. The company here estimates that the depreciation of 2025 is around 30 billion yuan. The main reason for this decrease is because of some equipment. The second part is that the depreciation is due.

The KPES part of the year 2024 is $269 billion. That's about 4 billion less than the previous guidance given to you. Avoiding this year 2025. One example of this 4 billion delay is now estimated by the company for the whole year 2025. KPES is the target of no more than 30 billion yuan. The 3rd time that talks about this future depreciation is the direction of KPES.

In the future, we will invest resources to vertical with this. The mobility solution will go to this light asset business model. So the capital expenditure and depreciation of the company in the medium and long term should go down year by year. Above. Thank you.

The next two questions are about the display market. Please ask the company season 4. Global TV and IT. The status of the product terminal sales. Outlook with 2025. China will increase the consumption stimulus and tariff impact on the outlook for 2025.

Whether there is an early purchase result. The second Q or second half of the peak season is uncertain. Also for TV and IT. The overall channel condition can not give an update. That part we ask James to answer. Hello everyone.

That's what Paul and Frank mentioned in the fourth quarter of the continent's old replacement. And there is this. The high season of Europe and America, this promotion I think.

There is a good score. TV is in season 4. Overall sales is about 3%. The number of YOY is growing.

That's why they are mainly large. Especially. 85 inches above or even 98 inches 100 inches. I think this is special. The continent's market is.

This is the time of the year when they will be cast into the lake of fire, or they will be cast into the lake of fire, or they will be cast into the lake of fire.

As I move forward, I want to say the entire TV. The inventory of the channel is very healthy. The outlook is also very good. Because of the large size of the next one, this demand will make the whole production capacity of this.

Demand is also very big. That's part of TV. That's part of IT. IT is still in 2024.

This is a part of the commercial. Comparison. No see. The temperature is only in the consumer market. Through this.

Gaming through this consumption. During the high season of promotions we also see. This also has a 4-5% YoY growth in the fourth quarter. So the inventory channel is still very healthy. That's the outlook. I think.

10 And he said unto them, This is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven, and this is the kingdom of heaven.

I'm looking forward to the next four to five years of this year, and I'm looking forward to it this year.

The demand still exists. Probably. 4-5% growth. Our customers expect this to be in the second half of the year.

The second half of the year may be a bit different.

Here's a re-arranged paragraph verbatim: I think the overall demand for TV this year is also good. IT has a lot of new secondary demand, so we're very optimistic about a demand for this year.

Thank you. Then we are developing the Q&A on the site to give more investors the opportunity to ask questions. Please reduce the problem to two and complete all the questions once. Before asking a question, please mention the name of the company and your name.

Diana, thank you for accepting my question. The first question is because the U.S. government has put forward a number of tariff-related policies here, which also affect the price of some of the panels being received in recent times. That is to say, in response to the tariff-related you have not seen any adjustments or trends in the way you communicate with customers in the supply chain or between the companies.

The second question is mainly about automobile-related, because just the Chairman and CEO actually mentioned that in the coming years, the expected revenue growth momentum of Double-digit, and then saw a significant increase in the order. Is it possible to say that the combined effect in the recent years is related to the cost-related numerical progress or expectations. That's because this year, like CES, there are a lot of new micro LED technology, how to see the increase in content in the future, and how it can improve the profitability of the car.

It is not clear how the tariffs will change so far, for example, this Mexican and Canadian eyes are expected to be subject to a tariff of 25%, and then suddenly this seven-hour delay, which means that there is actually a lot of room for negotiation and rotation. As for countries that have not been charged with the tariffs, we will not actually see where the purpose behind his tariffs is, for example, to slow down his trade deficit or for his safety, or for what other problems. Or even in his country, this raises his manufacturing problems. So we now have an impact on the tariffs, for example, Mexico was declared, we took into account whether this production or we sold Mexico to the United States as a whole.

This is not the only way to do this, unless all of us have an impact in the future. Of course, this is not going to happen overnight, because we have a lot of our supply chain and even our customers even say that our real customers, such as an example of a brand customer, but there are some of these OEMs in the middle, so what are they doing, because our products eventually we are out of OEMs so we have to look at how OEMs are doing. So we have to look closely and then we have to keep in touch with our supply chain and we have to know what they are doing. So to be honest, we can only talk closely and discuss how we can cope with this this year, or these uncertainties are included in our so-called company risk control.

So we can only look at a very flexible and dynamic way of looking at how we can do this differently in our global layout. Thanks. Or maybe it's a good car, so I'm talking about the entire revenues of the car mentioned in question 2, and some of the things we're following. So first, I'd like to talk about the total sales of our partnership with bc. So I'd like to give a few more recent examples that we're most concerned about investing in mergers and acquisitions of a few of the direction we're looking at.

We don't have a lot of flexibility compared to many manufacturers in the industry, as our global manufacturing has been fully supported by each other in several states. The second thing I think is important is to expand the business opportunities, and I've read the results of TL1 in the past and have just done with the reports that even in the last few years, I've given my own double-digit or nearly 20% growth each year.

The results are not that big, but after the acquisition of BHTC, our relationship with the world's factories is really very complete. That's only a few months ago, there were a lot of new cases on the European factory. The other is a commercial car, and in fact, a new development in the smart cabin, because the safety costs associated with this increasingly expensive and long-distance driving transport now require smart cabins, so we quickly got some new opportunities here for commercial customers in the U.S. and U.S.-U.A. China and India, especially India.

This is why we are still working on it, so we can see whether they increase or internally, we will put the money in accelerating and then implement it, and then there are subsequent progress I would like to report to you every time. So I think I just have a number to talk about, because we just focus on the future growth of the future, so I just want to report to you that we have more than $1.5 billion in the past three years together, so we raised about $22 billion in revenue on both sides, so this $1.5 billion can support our future growth.

So that's why we combine the transparent display of Micro-ID with the window, which we think there is a lot of innovation for the factory. In fact, there is not only a car in the development space, the car is also important, because the car is more and more self-driving trend, such as this Tesla wants to push this autonomous taxi, so how to interact with people on the road after the car is really another key issue. So you can see why we with Sony Afila to get a MediaBar, and even we talked to the factory to talk about the larger body display, why he actually does not give people in the car, he is to interact outside the car.

Thanks to Lisa, I'm a good leader and I'm a big fan of this car. I'm just talking about the fact that we're working with Sony Honda in the second half of next year, and I think it's really very good news. I can think of more and more of what we're thinking about in this new car, and that's because we're going to show up in the sky, and of course, this window may not be on the market at the moment, but I'm sure it's a problem with the car. The second question is that after we just mentioned that, we're going to go to this semiconductor test interface to develop that we don't have a short and long-term planning or have nothing to comprehensive planning with our existing products. Thanks for that, I think it's going to continue with Sony's company for many years.

People's display entertainment or work needs are all combined in the car. That's about cooperation with Sony Honda. That's the 2nd thing about mentioning the skylight. That's the thing that day, but I think the 1st challenge to tell the truth is that it's a big size. That's right, because this roof is an area.

That's also why we have such a converged line that will lead the industry in the 4th and 5th generation. Because this line is too small for you to make the size you want to be smaller. We can now make a larger size, so the number of stitches on the stitching can also become higher. This technology is also derived from some of the micro-LED stitching techniques that we have already mass production in TV.

And then the temperature of the environment. There are other problems with the sun. But the truth is that the other side is the advantage of micro-LED. Because the micro-LED itself inorganic lighting is advantageous in every aspect of the LCD or OLED's durability efficiency.

This is why we want to do a refactoring of this business. So the most important thing is to end the operation of this solar monocrystalline chip and then turn it into a semiconductor that, as the demand for semiconductors increases, we will continue to expand its capacity. But we think that this part of the semiconductor does not necessarily need a single plant and facility, so we will make this asset revitalization and then business reorganization so I think it will be in the direction of semiconductor for a long time. Thank you.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into a consistent paragraph while retaining all the original content.

This may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph, and then merging them together. First, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content. It looks like this is a description of the company's strategic adjustment, productivity optimization, asset revitalization, and financial goals. The spokesperson may discuss closing the Singapore plant, capacity layout, product strategy, personnel structure adjustment, asset processing, and operational cost control.

For example, the processing of a Singapore plant can be a paragraph, the productivity optimization and product strategy may consist of another paragraph, the personnel structure adjustment and asset revitalization may be separate, financial goals and operational cost control may need to be handled separately. During the process, I need to ensure that each sentence is consistent with the original, without any deletion or modification. For example, the original says "that we are currently working", which may be the beginning of a paragraph, and the following sentence should continue to discuss the current plan until another topic appears.

In addition, you need to pay attention to the pauses and repeats in your spoken language, such as the 'that', 'so' and other links, which may need to be retained in paragraphs to maintain the original intention. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as how to handle duplicated or redundant sentences, but according to the user's request, everything must be retained. For example, the 'we' and 'this' are mentioned many times in the original manuscript, and these need to be retained even if they may appear redundant in written language.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to professional terms and internal company terms, such as "three P", "LTPS", "micro-od", etc., to ensure that these terms are not misunderstood or mishandled during the conversion process. It may be necessary to keep the original, as the user requirements are not rewritten. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will check whether all the sentences are correctly classified and the transition between paragraphs is natural without missing anything. To ensure that each paragraph is logically coherent, consistent with the speaker's ideas, while strictly adhering to the user's requirements and without adding any personal interpretation or modification. In summary, the process requires careful reading, logical analysis and strict adherence to user instructions to ensure that the final paragraph texts are accurate and consistent with the structure and intent of the original content.

-- That's what we're planning to do right now. This part of our factory in Singapore has already begun, and the whole checkpoint is ready to enter, and the phase we're looking to sell is now looking for a partner for sale. The future production line we're going to have to move towards a better production capacity to layout that is just a strategy to share with you is how we're going to prioritize the key customers of the original display apart from doing the best development between two ps. That's also to report that these two ps are out of our capacity, and that's why most of us still have enough capacity to support the needs of our display. That's where we're going to continue our go premium strategy, whether the integration of the LTPS patch, and then the new micro-od, which we's going to be a high-quality development on display, that's just the way to improve our own profitability.
