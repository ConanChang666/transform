The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. All investment advanced afternoon. Thank you very much for participating in the online corporate briefing of today's Finest Co., Ltd.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the staff of today. Mr. Ip Chan Lai, Vice Chairman and General Manager, Mr. Wu Renjun, Chairman and Spokesperson, Mr. Chan Chi Cheong. Next, please consult the company for your company briefing.

All investors are welcome to invest in advanced. That's the same as saying disclaimers. The presentation content provided in the present law may include evaluations and forecasts of future conditions. The presentation content for the future is based on the comments available by the Company at this time as forecasts.

We remind you not to rely too much on this information. There is no responsibility for updating or rectifying the presentation. OK, there will be three parts to the agenda. I will first report to you on the results of the operation and the results of the operation in the first quarter of 2025. Let's take a look at the results of the first quarter and the results of the revenue report.

Operating results and revenue reports for the first quarter of that year. In the first quarter, we actually combined revenues of NT$146.8 billion. That was 12.6 compared to the same period last year. Net profit of NT$8.7 billion was also 0.44 compared to the same period last year. Net profit of parent company was NT$76 billion.

This page is a quarter-to-quarter comparison. Of course, the first quarter is because of the traditional low season, so the revenue decreases from the fourth quarter. Of course, the fourth quarter's revenue is actually a bit higher than we initially expected. So the overall net profit for the fourth quarter was $8.72 billion.

That EPS also reached $1.63. That EPS reached $1.63. In the first quarter, while we were in the low season, we actually reached $6.86 billion. That EPS also reached $1.57. That looks a little smoother. That's also better than when we made our budget at the end of last year.

This is the part of the shareholders' interest. OK, then look at this page is a detailed information. This page mainly tells you about our business gross profit. In fact, it is said that the growth since the fourth quarter of last year has increased by 2.4 percentage points.

In fact, the whole situation is the same. In fact, because last year's basis period is relatively high, we also have some self-discipline, and we have some cost reduction, and our entire revenue is higher than expected, so in the case of cost control and revenue, our own business benefits have reached nearly 20%, so the overall situation also looks good. The net profit portion of the current period, the revenue ratio reached 18.6%, so the whole part is basically different from the last quarter of last year.

The real estate portion of that property is basically that we account for the entire assets in the middle of the city, and the current 1st quarter of the market is maintained at 39%. It is also considered stable. The main reason for the increase in current liabilities there is because we have corporate debt that is due next year, so we will return it to the current liabilities for one year in accordance with the accounting principles, although the whole proportion is up, but the total debt is not really good. This first quarter of the year is 173 billion, the first quarter of the year is 179 billion, so the difference is not big.

This is reasonable. The entire fixed asset turnover also rose from 1.07 to 1.21 in the same period last year. The main reason for this is that my real estate facility really does not change much. But my first-quarter earnings increase from the same period last year also because of this overall fixed asset turnover.

This is a quick analysis of the asset schedule. OK, let's take a look at the cash flow table. The cash flow table is the first part of our month's cash also remains intact. There is probably a place in the whole of it that is much more varied is that this part of the real estate plant and equipment is actually increased.

We now have a QR code uploaded. There are some production capacity for AI light communication and mobile phone products. So there are some increase in capital expenditure. So this part of the whole reflected, the cost here is a bit more. So you see the free build traffic below, of course, fell. That's really reasonable because I do have business needs, so the entire investment has increased.

That's not the case, except for the other changes. Well, let's take a look at the revenue report. This is what we saw in Q3 because we all grew more than the same period last year, and now because we've also released new manuscripts before May and announced our revenue in accordance with the regulation No. 10. Our revenue as of May is now 78.4 billion. That's an increase of about 9% compared to the same period last year.

OK is the result and revenue report. Well, it is now reported by the vice chairman of my system company and the general manager. The operation of the market is important information. In terms of this operation, our combined sales are based on the customer application period, and we have consolidated revenue of 46.8.5 billion in the first quarter. It is about 13% higher than the same period last year.

That said, in terms of the application of our products, the smartphone is the largest in terms of our proportion. Its revenue is growing, but since the curve is not yet large, the proportion of smartphones has declined slightly from 37% last year to 34%.

This is a relatively growth. That consumption is about the same as a smart home. Generally, the amount is roughly the same as the proportion. It is maintained at about 20-19%. The relatively growth is about AI and light communication. From last year, it was 1%.

Now to 4%. That part of the growth is relatively large. The second part is that the data center HPC. The amount is also growing. The main reason for the decrease in the proportion is because there are some customers.

Make adjustments to the product. So there is an impact. But AI and HPC. The data center is basically closely related to the three. If you look at advanced legal persons, the two may be the same.

It's the same thing, it's the same thing, it's the past, it's the past, it's the HPC.

HPC accounts for approximately 18% of our share. Then we report on the copying outlook. 2025 Q1. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, it grew by 13%.

That looks like 2025. Together with AI phones. AI servers. ASIC optical communication. Broad chip. A desire to continue to grow here in SIG.

But there is still tariff uncertainty at the moment. It affects the global economy. That is, of course, right. The semiconductor industry. Indirectly it affects the exchange rate as well.

Business revenue and profit. That's what we say about SIG. The response is to actively develop new customers. New products. To cope with these challenges. That's long-term.

The demand for the core semiconductor chips in the future industry. It is expected to continue to grow. If there is no uncontrollable factor in the future. The demand for semiconductors should be an opportunity to grow. Our company is bullish on AI. ASIC AI mobile phones.

The demand for chip testing. Next, let's take a look at SIG. Invest for the future. Invest in R&D equipment. Invest in automated plant.

We're there. We're in the first quarter. We've made some necessary investments. Then we're in. May 2025. The Board has passed the best case for capital expenditure.

The amount has been increased to 35.37 million. Mainly used for the development of AI optical communication test.

AI flagship mobile testing and development. Expansion of capacity. That investment in 2025 is the main focus. It is for AI ASIC. Automotive is what we call 3AIC testing. R&D and investment.

It is called 3A technology. It is advanced testing technology. Automation is automation.

AI Factory is the smart factory of AI. We use 3A. Let's do business with 3A. In addition to the equipment and hardware investment, our company also uses 3A technology.

Strive for excellence in the factory. Strengthen the ability of R&D engineering to manufacture quality. Next is. Advanced precision testing technology. People's field of entrepreneurship. Try the second one.

That's convincing. at a time full of engine days. Currency problems. Then unknowns. And join the Silicon Light Industry Alliance of SAME. For customer needs.

Cooperate with suppliers to develop solutions. Third equipment for precision-made. We are called MAP. Improve high-speed home-made high-frequency SOC test equipment.

The next picture is the scene where our company actually tests silicon photons. Finally, for the sustainable development of the company. Mainly for us. The use of renewable energy is above. Our layout to 2030 is 30%. 2050 is a 100% renewable energy target.

Another important point is the recycling rate of waste. Our company reached 100% waste reuse rate in 2024. Other energy saving and carbon reduction we also achieved the goal.

Please refer to it for further details. OK, the above report is complete. Can you see it? Shut down.

Hello. For Mr. Zhang Jiawei, we have cooperated with SIG. CPU package. SIG is responsible for packaging. SIG is responsible for testing.

What is the current progress. Just reported it. That is, we have a growth in our AI and CPU performance. There are now many overseas customers working on this test at SIG.

At present, we can say that it is divided into domestic. Compared with overseas customers. At present, it is still 70% of domestic customers.

Automobile is now in full swing. Many customers push forward. Progress new products. Self-driving cars also have some different sounds. That comes from SIG here. We have received several new orders from customers in the second half of the year.

In ADS. Wireless. Smart cabin. We talk about the company. In the second half of the year, there will be some new Automobile customers introduced.

And he said unto them, Behold, the years are come, behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come, and the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come; behold, the years are come.

The company has two customers. White list customer status. And follow-up positive. Think about the top two customers in detail. Currently, it's pretty good for the detailed orders. Everyone knows they're good for their first quarter performance.

The second season also looks good. Whitelist customers do. Because this has a whitelist. The details are right in the whitelist style of BIS, so there are really many whitelists. In mainland China or elsewhere.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's verbatim text and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim text provided by the user in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

Then, I need to arrange the contents of these sequential sentences in chronological order and make them easier to read. For example, when the sentences of the same topic appear continuously, it can be combined into a paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the dialogue, such as the relationship between the question and the answer, it may be necessary to put questions and answers in the same paragraph to maintain the clarity of the context. During the process, I pay special attention to the order of the timestamps to ensure that each sentence is in the correct position.

In addition, there are some duplicate questions and answers in the user's example, such as "What is the difference between AI and data center products" is mentioned many times, and I need to make sure that these duplicated content is preserved and correctly segmented. At the same time, pay attention to the name and role of the dialogue, such as "Zhao Yuming", "Chief Secretary's Answer", etc., which need to be retained in the paragraphs to be clear speakers. Finally, I will read the collated paragraph verbatim to check whether all the original statements are correctly contained, without omissions or errors, and that paragraphs are logically divided and in accordance with the reading habits.

[1184. 06-1187. 62] is now starting to generate some revenue. [1187. 62-1189. 72] is expected to be in the fourth quarter. [1189. 72-1190. 26] This revenue is expected to grow gradually. [1190. 26-1192. 26] Zhao Qin. [1192. 26-1201. 46] Zhao Qin. [120. 46-1207. 96] Production capital expenditure and subsequent depreciation.

[1207. 96-1213. 08] How the company views the gross profit margin in the coming quarters. [1213. 08-1215. 30] The mayor replied. [1215. 30-1219. 92] Your current capacity utilization is probably the lowest. [1220. 26-1222. 02-1226. 26] The entire semiconductor downturn at that time was about 60%. [1226. 26-1228. 34] We actually went up every quarter.

[1228. 34-1230. 14] Six-tenths and five-tenths. [1230. 14-1233. 34] We are now in the midst of seven-tenths and five-tenths. [1233. 34-1235. 10] It looks pretty stable. [1235. 10-1236. 74] No less than seven-tenths. [1236. 74-1239. 22] So it looks like we all jumped up. [1239. 22-1240. 94] The capital expenditure was just reported to us.

[1240. 94-1245. 50] Our capital expenditure is increased by 35 to 3.7 billion. [1245. 50-1246. 56] The main thing is just what we said. [1246. 56-1248. 26] We have a few needs. [1248. 26-1250. 10] After this capital expenditure. [1250. 10-1252. 18] We have added. [1252. 18-1255. 66] This is because we have some depreciation expirations in the past few years.

So we look at our first quarter depreciation. [1257. 78-1259. 46] In fact, we are all still waiting for it. [1259. 46-1261. 02-1262. 46] The highest point of our company. [1262. 46-1263. 58] About the depreciation of every quarter. [1263. 58-1265. 56] It will reach 1.1 billion.

[1265. 56-1268. 40] That's probably a billion dollars up and down right now. [1268. 40-1271. 52] So it looks like this depreciation has to go on again. [1271. 52-1273. 46] Because we've gone up the whole revenue. [1273. 46-1278. 10] So the whole part of depreciation should not cause us a lot of trouble. [1278. 10-1279. 78] That's the future. [1280. 10-1282. 86] Look at how much gross interest rates we'll see in the coming quarters.

[1282. 86-1294. 98] This is really difficult to estimate. [1284. 98-1288. 94] Because some of the causes outside the present are also more. [1288. 94-1290. 96] This is still not a good estimate. [1290. 96-1294. 16] We are still working on improving our revenues. [1294. 16-1295. 82] includes just Mr. Dong. [1295. 82-1296. 86] We have some white lists.

[1296. 86-1298. 42] There are other customers. [1298. 42-1310. 38] We found a way to get our revenues up. [1300. 38-1304. 74] This basically allows us to maintain our gross profit to a certain extent. [1304. 74-1306. 50] This supplement is addressed in detail. [1306. 50-1309. 42] Our investment is mainly targeted. [1309. 42-1310. 10]

[1310. 10-1312. 10] Large customer demand. [1312. 10-1314. 42] and whitelist customer demand. [1314. 42-1318. 42] and our own newly added new customers. [1318. 42-1319. 42-1321. 74] These gross profit margins are relatively good. [1321. 74-1324. 46] Of course we do our best.

[1324. 46-1326. 22] There is also some uncertainty in the market. [1326. 22-1328. 54] Just as the chairman said. [1328. 54-1330. 62] We are in uncertainty. [1330. 62-1337. 14] Let's do our best. [1340. 10-1347. 98] This is not. [1347. 98-1353. 70] This is not.

[1353. 70-1356. 94] This one. [1356. 94-1359. 90] This one. [1359. 90-1360. 66] Do you have a taste? [1360. 66-1364. 50] Will the EQ level be maintained by force in the following seasons. [1364. 50-1366. 18] This also requires the chairman to answer. [1366. 18-1368. 18] This.

[1368. 18-1369. 18] I just said. [1370. 10-1377. 64] First, I answered that question. [1377. 641381. 02] is the portion of this year's operational outlook. [1381. 02-1382. 66] The cost rate has just been mentioned. [1382. 66-1389. 90] The cost rate is basically about 9%.

[1400. 10-1404. 44] There is a problem. [1404. 44-1407. 94] Ask the smartphone application prospects. [1407 94-1410. 76] Smartphone application. [1410. 76-1415. 44] Everyone knows that the smartphone is now. [1415. 44-1418. 12] There is also the introduction of AI. [1418. 12-1422. 10] So the future should be the application of AI.

[1422. 10-1427. 28] So the function of the mobile phone chip is more powerful. [1427. 28-1429. 74] For. [1429. 74-1430. 08] For mobile phone applications. [1430. 08-1431. 84] Based on the test-oriented system. [1431. 84-1435. 18] This increases the test time of the chip. [1435. 18-1436. 88] The chip is more complex.

[1436. 88-1440. 94] So there is a good trend for the test field. [1440. 94-1456. 04] There is a problem here. [1456. 04-1459. 14] Please ask for the exchange rate appreciation. [1459. 14-1459. 96] For gross profit margin. [1459. 96-1460. 06] The problem with gross profit margin. [1460. 06-1460. 54] The effect on gross profit margin.

[1460. 54-1464. 82] What is the share of revenue from the upper dollar. [1464. 82-1467. 96] This part is reported to everyone. [1467. 96-1470. 60] is the currency appreciation rate. [1470. 60-1472. 22] This part affects gross profit. [1472. 22-1474. 46] I think it should be roughly the same as the industry. [1474. 46-1480. 24] Sun Moon Lake also said it would probably increase by 1%.

[1480. 24-1483. 56] seems to have an effect on gross profit of 0.5%. [1483. 56-1486. 78] Our company is about 0.6. [1486. 78-1489. 20] So it is probably not very different from each other. [1490. 06-1493. 06] The whole part. [1492. 06-1493. 52] Of course it is as if it was just said.

[1493. 52-1496. 08] We will continue to strive to improve our revenue. [1496. 08-1497. 82] That revenue will increase. [1497. 82-1498. 76] After the exchange rate increases. [1498. 76-1501. 40] Can make up for the impact of the exchange rate. [1501-1508. 18] OKNext problem is [1508. 18-1510. 06] Good management team.

[1510. 06-1512. 10] Can we talk in detail. [1512. 10-1514. 58] Is the capital expenditure composition in 2025. [1514. 58-1516. 54] is mainly used in some areas. [1516. 54-1518. 16] and their respective proportions. [1518. 16-1519. 94] We. [1519. 94-1523. 18] Our 2025 capital expenditure.

[1523. 18-1525. 18] I have just said it. [1525. 18-1531. 46] is mainly used to expand the capacity of AI phone chip. [1531. 46-1533. 70] Then the second is said. [1533. 70-1537. 98] We also increase the R&D of fine light paper. [1537. 98-1541. 70] and the capacity of fine light paper testing. [1541. 70-1548. 10] This is also the expansion of AI server-related capacity.

[1548. 10-1551. 68] There is also a high-speed computing-related capacity expansion. [1551. 68-1554. 60] Expansion of Netcom chip capacity. [1554. 60-1559. 28] Mainly here. [1559. 28-1567. 04] Third quarter revenue after. [1567. 04-1569. 48] Real revenue growth. [1569. 48-1574. 02] What is the difference between AI and data center products?

[1574. 02-1575. 98] What is the difference between AI and data center products? [1578. 10-1585. 04] It is actually used in the data center. [1585. 04-1586. 98] Most of it is used in the data center. [1586. 98-1589. 72] Communication between the server side of the AI is a problem. [1589. 72-1594. 36]

[1596. 12-1600. 46] This AI can be positioned with light. [1600. 46-1601. 60] So we are positioned. [1601 60-1604. 64] We put it together in the classification. [1608. 10-1611. 04] So we put it together in the classification. [1611. 04-1613. 70] Adjustment of HPC. [1613. 70-1619. 74] Is the customer.

[1619. 74-1623. 98] should be the adjustment of its product portfolio. [1623. 98-1628. 18] We look forward to the completion of the adjustment of its product portfolio. [1628. 18-1634. 20] can also respond to growth momentum. [1638. 10-1645. 10] Third.

The three-Q looks the same, but also optimistic, and the three-Q looks the same. Then, how much do you have on your account? The impact on the outside industry, this ask the chairman to answer, this is the chairman to answer.

I think this question should be the situation that every company will face, and how much impact on the industry? I think this question should be the situation that every company will face, and I think that this question should be the situation that every company will face. Because from Q1 about 3. 205, because from Q1 about 3. 205, because from Q1 about 3. 205, because from Q1 about 3. 205, it has actually been upgraded to 29, in fact it has been upgraded to 29. So every company basically, so every company basically, I think it is a big difference, I think it is a big difference, and I think it will be exported.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please ask the progress of the center mall, please ask the progress of the center mall, the center mall, we are currently under construction, we are currently under construction, the progress is as planned as the original plan, should be in the first quarter of 2027, can enter the West Taiwan to increase the capacity, both can enter the West Taiwan to increase the capacity.

Sorry, because the second number has not yet ended, so it is not easy to do some speculation, then we can not announce some figures, okay. Please report, at present, about about one dose, the current order person about one dose, right, right, right, right, right. Just mention, just mentioned the effect of the exchange rate of the 10%, affect the gross profit rate 6%, so the number is right? Is the company with the customer in time to adjust the quotation?
