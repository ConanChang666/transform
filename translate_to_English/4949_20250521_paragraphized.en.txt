<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

For example, I need to make sure that the sequence of sentences within each paragraph is consistent with the original, while appropriate segmentation is based on the consistency of the content. For example, the parts of the company and business can be merged into a paragraph, the data and analysis of financial performance can be divided into separate paragraphs, and the operational outlook can be divided into separate paragraphs.

In addition, it is necessary to check whether there are duplicates or redundant content, but according to the user's request, no sentences can be deleted, so even if there is duplicates, it must be retained. For example, in the original, the mention of "Our business income decreases" and "Business income see is always declining" may be repeated, but must be retained. When processing financial data, pay attention to the accuracy of the numbers and terms, to ensure that the converted paragraphs are clearly readable.

At the same time, check that the punctuation and format are correct, and ensure that the user's requirements are met. </think> [paragraph verbatim]:

We apologize for any inconvenience. The disclaimer is mainly divided into three main categories. Thank you for the advanced arrival. In the operation report, I will divide the company into four categories, and the four parts will explain.

The first is the company profile, the second is the financial performance of the first quarter of this year, as well as the operational outlook, as well as the supplementation of some important activities. The company was founded in 2003 with semiconductor consumables as a starting point. We, like us, entered Europe in 2007 to set up their brand channel company, WinEco is our international brand. So far, our company capital is 6.7 billion, a total of 403 employees in domestic and overseas. The company mainly two important VU, the development of key components of a new semiconductor process equipment, and our module channel of solar energy, called WinEco brand.

Financial performance. As you can see, this table shows two trends. The first trend is from this year's Q1 Q4 to the previous year's comparison, and we see both trends. The first is the decline in our revenue, and the decrease in revenue is actually the main reason why solar energy comes from.

So even if we sell as much as we do, our revenue will go down. This is the first point, our revenue is seen to go down. The second is our gross profit margin, and the gross profit margin is certainly rising. In the past, there have been elites in the past more than a year, but it is also because the entire price is falling at a rapid rate, and because of this decline, our revenue impact.

In fact, we have a lot of negative gross margins for sale, but because of our solar gross margin, everyone's gross margins are relatively high, so we hold our gross margins, until last year Q3 has improved significantly, and our gross margins have begun to turn positively this year. Then we can see from this surface that we have effectively cleared our inventory, our sun's inventory, because our stock levels are the highest, we lower the inventory levels are relatively clear, so we can see our very natural average consumption, and we control the stock levels, so our average consumption days, we will reduce the amount of inventory, and we will reduce the amount of our collection.

In the past years, we have been working with our customers for more than 20 years. Our semiconductors are mainly our market in four places, Taiwan Singapore Japan and the United States, so our key source of revenue for semiconductors is in Taiwan market, and the other 50% in the international market, such as Singapore and the United States, etc. The main layout of our solar energy is Europe, the second largest in Australia, and the next one in Taiwan, and we are actively in Southeast Asia.

The part of the sun that we look forward to is the same as last year, which is our goal.

As you can see, we have always been proud of ourselves, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the best equals in the semiconductor marathon. So we will continue to work with our customers to meet all the requirements of our customers. In fact, in the market, in that regard, I can talk about the width and depth of our market.

In Japan, Japan, Japan, after our important customers in Taiwan set up their factories in Japan, we are now thinking that it is important for us to use our home coach, and then to expand from the outside. But Japan is more important because the Japanese process, unlike Taiwan, it does not have advanced processes, so it is an old factory, old factory. On the other hand, many other Japanese customers, whether customers, or manufacturers like some semiconductors, will come to work with us, and this is all about.

That's what we feel about it. That's why we've been living in Singapore for about 18 years. That's why we've always been home coach for about 90% of the time in Singapore. That's why we've just mentioned that there's a percentage of our revenue in semiconductors, blue five is Taiwan, and blue five is actually international, and the blue five comes from the international market.

That is, the depth of the product, in fact, we have to actively expand. That is, three years ago, we have been actively in other processes to cross-border. That is, we have been certified by our customers since last year. We are all in advanced processes and in advanced processes. So we are constantly working with our customers to develop key leading components of our process, which we are working on.

The first is our European market. Do you think that the European market in last year's device volume can be higher than 70 G? Is 65 G higher? Lower than last year's. The key is because the interest rate is very high, and the whole interest rate is very high, so the interest rate is indeed in Europe, so it will make a lot of investment expectations, the booking is lower, the interest factor.

But we are looking forward to seeing how this year's forecast will start to rise, so far so we feel the same, and next year will be higher. But there is a very crucial factor, I would like to report this is also the European market policy. I think the policy part, like in Germany as a scale, it has passed in February this year, we call the solar wind quality method, Solar Pits, solar wind quality method.

The goal is to encourage energy storage, flexible use, and ultimately accelerate the integration of renewable energy. What is the concept of energy storage? Not to say that my power plant, or my home storage is good, but not. Our energy storage system, my solar, my power company, and the grid are integrated. They have to communicate, they have to have to be chat, they have to decide when, what they want to do.

What is the concept of this policy table after the implementation of this policy table? European electricity is transformation, in full transformation. In fact, it has been years of transformation, but this year's legislation, this is a big one, big one, a different policy. So also in accordance with this policy, we see that we ended up with Q1 this year, Q1 is not high, because everyone is watching this policy, and Q2 can see some aspects.

I have to install this, I have to install this, my needs are to install solar panels, what is my purpose? It is already going to be every home, every home smart electricity, smart green electricity use, this is already a stand-alone warning. This is the short policy. The second policy is like, in May of this year, like Italy also passed a law called ISEE, that is, each home-based roof, they will subsidize 15,000 euros. His purpose, he is subsidies, but what is his purpose?

Insurance is basically our main focus in Europe. What is the concept of all risk? Before I just came to the meeting, I also asked my family to explain all risk in detail, because it is complex. Like your device solar.

Here's a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. You have to be financially risky. You have to be at risk of machine failure. Electrical failure. These things are sold by many solar companies in Europe. So we have insurance in Italy that belongs to the home.

So I just wanted to tell you that from the 13th of May until now, our insurance company has received a few cases, about 60. After 60 roofs waiting for two or three days, we will register our roof directly. Their roof Italian roofs will use our solar energy directly, and so on. So we can see that the whole trend is really related to your Q3 Q4. This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism and so on.

This is another example of this policy. The market can then be seen because the entire price of the entire year last year began to decline the whole price quickly. Then everyone clear up the stock storage is also effective because many companies in mainland China before it will collapse or else he will not be able to ship after it has been removed. In fact, this year Q1 happened in mainland China this year, three months in February, basically all of the bank first-line two-line shows are not shipped. So we had insurance in Italy. So we just wanted to say that we have received a few cases from our insurance company, about 60 times.

We have 60 roofs waiting for two or three days to register our roofs directly. Their roofs in Italy will use our solar energy directly, and so on. So we can see that the whole trend is really related to your Q3 Q4. This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism, etc.

This is another example of this policy. The market can then be seen because the entire price of the entire year last year began to drop the whole price quickly. Then everyone clears up the stock and it's also effective to remove it because many companies in the mainland are going to collapse before it's gone or he's now going to ship and have no money to ship. So we've had insurance in Italy before. So I just wanted to say that from May 13th to now our insurance company has received a few cases, about 60.

So you can see the whole trend is really relevant to your Q3 Q4. This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism, etc., but it is also the example of this policy.

And then the market can be seen because the entire price of the year last year began to decline the whole price of the year last year quickly. Then everyone clear up the stock storage is also effective to get rid of why is it because many companies in the continent before it will collapse or else it will collapse after it has been removed, and now he has no money to ship. So we have insurance in Italy. So we just asked our family to say that from May 13 to now our insurance company has received a few cases, about 60. There are already 60 roofs waiting for two or three days to register our roof. Their roofs in Italy will be directly used to live our solar and so on their roofs.

So you can see the whole trend is really relevant to your Q3 Q4. This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism, etc., but it is also the example of this policy.

And then the market can be seen because the entire price of the entire year last year began to decline the whole price quickly. Then everyone clears up the stock and it is also effective to remove the reason why many companies in the mainland will be closed before it is closed or he will now be shipped after it has been removed. So we have insurance in Italy. So I just wanted to say that from May 13 to now our insurance company has received a few cases, about 60.

This year's policy is not expected to do such pessimism, etc. But it is also the proportion of this policy. And again, the market can see, because the whole price of last year's whole year began to drop the whole price quickly. Then everyone clear up the stock storage is also effective to get rid of why because many companies in the mainland are going to collapse before it collapses, or because he is now going to ship after it is removed, so we have insurance in Italy. So I just wanted to say that from May 13 until now, our insurance company has received a few cases, about 60.

We have 60 roofs waiting for two or three days to register our roofs directly. Their roofs in Italy will use our solar energy directly, and so on. So we can see that the whole trend is really related to your Q3 Q4. This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism, etc.

This year's policy will not imagine such pessimism, etc. But it is also the ratio of this policy. And then the market can see, because the whole price of last year began to decline quickly, the whole price of last year.

I'm talking about the three of them. The rest is not. The rest is not. We're talking about it all year round. We're important. We've had a few relatively big shows over the last few years.

We are all actively involved in our company. Like the Holland Show in Europe. Like the Inter Solar in Germany. The Dusseldorf in November. And we are inside the semi-island China Show.

Half Island Taiwan Exhibition. Life is watching West. There is our solar inside. Energy Taiwan has ours in Australia. 2nd to 5th May. We will be there.

There's a lot of technical forum going on around here. It's like we're helping to build a iron. There's also October. We're in Australia. It's an important trade fair in Western Australia.

O-Energy's Conference. That's why we're very active in our company. We're very active in our China and Australia markets. We're doing it for the ground. We're doing it for extension and development. That's what we've been doing for the last four years.

This is the time for us to give thanks to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and to give thanks to Him for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and to give thanks to Him for the blessings He has bestowed upon us.

Here you can raise your hand. Ask us a question. The gross profit margin in the first quarter seems to be slow up to 29. Why is it?

It doesn't matter. It shouldn't take too much action. It's a habit. I think. It's a part of the semiconductor industry. It's its gross profit margin.

It's probably the same as the square. It's very low. The main change is from the solar. When the semiconductor becomes the problem.

And the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall be darkened, and the stars shall be darkened, and the powers of the world shall be changed.

I don't know how you can understand this. The spread is usually said to be the same as before. One watt can earn a cent to two cents, but when it stacks up to 60%, its gross profit will float.

Because of this. The overlap of the module. It is the overlap of the module. Of course, the overlap of the module. Of course, the overlap of the module. Of course, the overlap of the module.

Of course, the price of the module is overpriced. The main reason is here, but the part of the semiconductor is always very invincible. It's about 45 to 50 in the middle of the month.

They will say, "We have been doing this for years," and they will say, "We have been doing this for a long time, and we have been doing this for a long time."

So our raw materials become cheap. The price of the market should be the price of the market. The price of the solar module is falling. In fact, this part is only in mainland China.

And the Lord said unto him, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for 90% of the land is under the hand of the LORD; for we have sinned against him.

Today it dumps to what extent. Today it may just want to exchange cash. It may be the bottom margin. It may be the cliff type. Just called the cliff type.

It is 30 blocks in average. Interest rate. But the so-called blister. It's only 90. It's straight up at 90 degrees. I'll add it.

I'm going to explain it. Gary said he was talking about the current situation. It's not right. That's the opposite of the past being Mao's position. In fact, there's another reason why we're talking about anatomy.

Because of the low cost of goods, we can sell them because of the cost of goods.

The cost is 10. Then we can sell 10, 30, 40. Then we can sell 10 now 10, 10, 50, 90. We can also sell.

We used to have gross margins in the past. That's the current gross margin. Maybe 20%. So there are two issues. Then again, that's what I'm talking about.

This is the whole world.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be retained sentence-by-word while organizing them into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I read through the whole transcription to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section involves the adjustment of the solar industry, energy storage system, Taiwan and the global market, as well as the company strategy. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical paragraph in order to make a reasonable segmentation. The timestamps and sentences in transcription may be a little repetitive or jumpy, such as "Taiwan's modular process" and "third-D needs" several times.

For example, the sentences [1506. 00-1507. 00] to [1508. 00-1510. 00] may belong to the same paragraph, discussing stimulation of consumption and work needs. The subsequent sentences about Ten Tent and Ales may belong to another paragraph, indicating that the manufacturer is turning to the energy storage system. In the process, some sentence structures may be incomplete or duplicate, such as "our modular process in Taiwan" repeated many times, need to determine whether it is false or emphasized, to maintain the original. At the same time, note that the Q&A section in the conversation, such as the user asks "is the mainland market or the world", the answer "global", these need to retain the original sentences, and appropriate segmentation.

For example, "the need for a VPC" may refer to a product or technology, but not sure what it means, but the original sentence must be preserved. Finally, check whether the transition between paragraphs is natural to ensure logical coherence, while not missing any sentences. For example, the reason for closing the factory in Taiwan and the changes in the global market requires a reasonable segmentation so that the reader can understand the development of the content smoothly.

And of course, this is also because of the more stimulation of consumption. I just said strong, but in fact it is also a job to do. This is because in the past two years, solar energy work is in demand, many manufacturers, such as Tianteng, speak like Tianteng or Aales, they are, they run out of energy, even they run out of energy, and run out of energy.

In the past, we had a modular factory in Taiwan last year, we closed the factory, because of the needs of Taiwan itself in the VPC, because last year, we also saw a module process in Taiwan, because we were in Taiwan's module technology, we we in Taiwan's module technology, we we in Taiwan's module technology, we in Taiwan's module technology, we in fact, we saw the last year, because Taiwan was a fetus VPC, because of the addition, but later our customers are no longer in their needs, they are no longer in their needs, but for green electricity, they are not in the need of the VPC. In the past, our customers are invincible in the industry, it may be very suitable for VIT, it may be the state is very suitable for VIT, it is more important than the VPC does not help electrification, and then now, it is not, it is because of Apple, it is invaded by its request to green electricity, then it must be green electricity for its own use, then it will not become a grid, that the grid, it is a good way to buy the PVC, so such a structure has changed, and the second generation of Taiwan green electricity liberalization, like a lot of Taiwan, like many companies, we all know that they are going to buy green electricity, then they may go with Taiwan a lot of banks, like a few in Taiwan, like Taiwan design companies, or like Taiwan design companies, like Taiwan design companies, such as we are like McDonald Starbucks, they are going to buy green electricity, and other communication services, because they are going to sign a lot of electricity, we are with them, we are now.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. a policy energy. It is energy. It is a very policy industry. So, you are our past, because we are in TYAN, already ten, this year is 17 years.

So we have seen a lot of cases, many of them are this year's decisions, today's decisions, you may be wrong next year. Whether in the three-and-five policy, the three-and-five decision, or in the head decision, you may be a failure, also because of such a cycle. We believe that in the Taian industry, doing this product, to the product perspective, in fact, no one in the world has done enough, this is no way, that is the world, that is, Taiwan's advantage is what, so we think now, what is our advantage, what is our advantage, so the advantage is, we have to go, is that to the world, we want our channel refers to what we do, we have to do, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, we are, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, we are, the way, the way, the way, the way, the way, we have made, we are, we have made, we have made in the world, we have made, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we know, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we know, we know, we have a lot, we know, we know, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we have a lot, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we have a lot, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, it, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, it, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, it, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, it, it, we know, we know, it, it, This is the reason why Europe is now being discussed in a strong way like Germany, is to put solar energy in every home, each home inside the home, the installation of solar comes, each home has to be a smart home, a smart home in the country has a business, please teach, there is a business way, operating solar and nitrogen oxygen energy, the similar thing is that if the solar is wind, the oxygen energy is pure color, that price drop, today we also see that the shipment will not grow, anyway, what you think, we will do in that way, but we will still be different from last year, because of the problem of ASD, but this year we will be more like a cloudy surface, the current is the trend, we have found, a lot of chemical, actually pay attention to our solar is a little stream, because we have been to the semiconductor, because we have found it is the last year, it is a semiconductor, it is only in the year, because it is a lot of the year, because it is the year, it is a lot, it is a lot, because it is a lot, because it is a lot, because it is a lot, because it is a lot, it is a lot, because it is a lot, it is a lot of the semiconductor, because it is a lot of the year, because it is a lot, because it is a lot of the year, because it is a lot, because it is a new year, it is a new year, it is a lot, it is only, it is a lot, it is a new year, it is that, it is that is that, it is a new year, it is a new year, it is a new year, it is a new, it is a new year, the semiconductor, it is a new year, it is a lot, it is a year, it is a Q5, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is, it is a new year, it is, it is, it is, it is only, it is a lot, it is a lot, it is, it is a lot, it is, it is a lot, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is a half, it is a half, it is a year, it is, it is, it is

This is a slippery slope, so you will see the slippery slope and the slippery slope of the slippery slope.

So do you think your expenses will go down? You look, semiconductor, why? I really mean. The main cost is luck, because our goods are from that factory. We went out from that factory. That's because we didn't have to pay the cost in the past, so the mid-sized, mid-sized, mid-sized ones were delivered.

Yes, not only the large number, but also the sales of customers. Yes, all sent. That is, the operation of the stock, because now the product is made cheaper, so that, the beauty becomes higher. Then everyone will see, because everyone is the stock, maybe very little, but this stock is, because, these three, the only thing that has not changed is the stock, because the only thing that has been going up recently is that the stock hasn't changed, and now it has changed. Right, semiconductor is mainly for us, that is, we are this, that we do the key.

It is a good thing to be able to work with you, but it is not a bad thing to work with you. It is a good thing to work with you, but it is a good thing to work with you. It is a good thing to work with you, but it is a good thing to work with you, and it is a good thing to work with you. It is a good thing to work with you, but it is not a bad thing to work with you, it is a good thing to work with you, it is a good thing to work with you, it is a good thing to work with you, it is a good thing to work with you, it is a good thing to work with you.

In the previous year, generally or about 25%, to the last year, it accounted for 43%, but it rose in fact, I said, semiconductor revenue, it is actually slow growth, it has not declined, may be 5%, 10% growth, then of course, we still look at our main customers, that, last year will account for 43%, only because of the decline in the revenue of solar energy, because of the relationship between the price, there are two reasons why, of course, two revenues are that the two CF revenues are almost the same, a 49%, a 51%, and 51% of semiconductors, which will produce this reason, the first is the price of solar energy, the second is the fact that, it says that solar energy does not grow most of the growth, but we do not expect it.

In fact, in the year-round, the revenue of solar energy is likely to exceed semiconductors, just now or observe, because semiconductors are stable, but the revenue of solar energy is actually easy to do, because there are too many policy purposes, and the purpose of the supply chain, to the point that it is not urgent. In fact, it is like two Q1 in the world, we have broken up the company, after some 2000 years, many people have drawn, right, BSNA, right, that these 2000 years, to see what is the situation of semiconductors, then solar energy is back semiconductor things, easy to talk about, it is solar energy is good, because it has semiconductors, material strength, material strength, so actually semiconductor is right right right, then what is right. We do not need to spend a lot of time, energy, experimentation, delivery, improvement, etc. We can not see before, we can say that, but we have the advanced process, we get the number of items we get, compared with the previous, look at the customer drawing how much, you see, the quality of the customer drawing, so we imagine here, the plant machine is our strength, for the plant machine is our strength, so the customer is our strength, the customer is our focus, the same is our focus, the same equipment is our focus, the same equipment is the same is the same equipment is the same, the same equipment is the same is the same, why there are some equipment is a mountain, there exists exists, there is a mountain, there is a exist, there is a exist, there is a exists a process depends, the process should be different factors.
