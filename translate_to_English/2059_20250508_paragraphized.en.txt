<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there are duplicates or errors. For example, between timestamps [57. 98-58. 04] and [58. 06-62. 38], there is a phrase "Then quickly meet again" repeated, which may be an error or duplicate, but according to the user's request, the original phrase must be preserved, so the two sentences need to be retained. Next, I will arrange each timestamp corresponding content in chronological order, and then group them according to semantics and logic, forming a coherent paragraph.

In addition, the user mentioned "King of Fortune" can be a name error, correct should be "King of Fortune", but according to the original text, it is necessary to retain the original, so it is necessary to confirm whether there are other spelling errors in the original text, but according to the information provided, it may be necessary to retain the original. When processing financial data, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the numbers and terms, such as "Year-over-Year" in "Sales Maori YY Growth 149%", and "YOY" is also an annual ratio, need to maintain the original.

The following is the compiled paragraph type transcription (totally retain the original content, only adjust the layout and markup): We welcome you to participate in the online legal conference hosted by Fubon Securities Co., Ltd. I also spoke to the chief executive of today's company, Mr. Wang Junqiang, he will share with you the company's operation status and future prospects. I will first give the time to Mr. Wang, thank you.

The overall performance of our 114-year-old Q1 has been announced yesterday. I have been reporting with you since this point of loss. In the first quarter of 114, gross revenue of 39.500 million, sales cost of 9.4 billion, and sales gross profit of 30.700 million. Then soon meet again.

Pre-tax earnings of 31.35 percent YOY increased 80. 86%, Tax after 25.111 YOY grew 81%. A US stock tax of $26.35 billion YoY grew 81%. A foreign exchange interest of $3.5 billion in the first quarter had a foreign exchange interest of $2.5 billion, affecting almost two eps of money.

The next step is to transform Trump into a server from 2000 to a server, and by the time the 2021 and 22 pandemic, more than 3000 patents were created, all of which were integrated into the AI generation. From the beginning of the year of GPUs in 2013 to 2024, a GP200 was introduced at the end of 2024. We believe that is to work hard in the industry, and then try to innovate, to gain all the dependence, favor and trust of all customers around the world.

What we see is the overall performance of all of our shareholders, I believe, is that we all follow our growth, then we share the growth of the enterprise to everyone. Then we began to ask you questions. Thank you for sharing King's wealth. Next time for Q&A comments and exchanges, you are welcome to invest in advanced can open your own microphone, ask questions, or you can leave your questions in the chat room text, thank you.

I think we made it to the perfect one, including the two years of U.S. dollar appreciation and Ah, the circle, in fact, we have been in the past few months have been in the exchange of Taiwan dollars to include the Huawang stock can advance to the end of the year, the remaining nearly 191 million Taiwan dollars in the current yuan, uh, the USD part of nearly 11 positions until March 31, or later let him rise to 4,5% of the U.S. dollar interest rate, this way no one can predict what the exchange rate will be, but I still emphasizing the core value of the creation, far more than the exchange rate difference, come to a lot better performance than those, I think, the exchange rate is inevitable, the whole in just a few days, nearly 10%, the exchange rate is a direct impact on the profit of a one, more than the one, rather than the normal, we look at the last 20 years we have been running from 2733 has been running a few times this is at this is very normal, but at us, but at a very normal cash, but at least, we are not a billion. In the second quarter of the year, the second quarter of the first quarter of the year is really the high-base period, the high-level period, then I thought the second quarter is if the first quarter is high, if the second quarter is high, if the second quarter is the second quarter is the high season, oh, Pingha, keep on working hard to see whether it can resume growth, that in May, saw the big yuan yuan, yuan will rise in the value of yuan, that 10%, we still think no change in the direction of investment, we still follow the festival to you, the comparison has not changed at the moment, the only change is tariffs and the problem with this life, the demand or, the yuan flow has been inferred, and the application of the broader, I think that the short-term may be disorder, but there is in order to see a future trend of the industry, the next year, there is still a basis of a performance, there is the seven levels.

The U.S. dollar uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

This is the first time that I have asked you about the EQ25. You can't go wrong with the EQ25. You can't go wrong with the EQ25. You can't go wrong with the EQ25. You can't go wrong with just a few months.

What is the impact of uh 1% more of the gross profit margin? uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

U.S. factory. bought it in August last year. In fact, U.S. factory started looking for 2024. In 2023, it began looking for the problem of the post-contract.

That's the whole electrical distribution we're going to do soon. At least the equipment has been ready here in Taiwan. The whole place is there. So you should see it in the next year or so. We're there. One of the start of one operation.

The next question is whether we will ship to Honghai and Apollol. I think we've set it up last year. We've been there a lot. Many of the factories are starting to set it up near us. I think there's no result at this time. But I think there's a lot of projects to mass production there or to discuss with customers in detail.

In the future, I believe that many Taiwanese chambers of commerce are located there. The factory. Good question is the driving force of EQ25. Q1 2020 driving power. Enough driving power, I think it is now up to 1.4 billion. 1.4 billion I think.

160%. Now I'm 100% sure I'll be there. There's also a 6066070% capacity. Plus the Houston plant if. The more and more refined the actual equipment, the better. I think this capacity is me.

We have a lot of space this is not the main problem at the moment. But there is still enough space for driving. The next question is uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-

If you are interested in investing, please open your own microphone to ask questions. Or go to the chat room to write text to answer questions. The chat room text to leave your question thank you.

That's how I confirm it. It's pretty much how we estimate your company's gross profit margin for the second quarter of this year. It's probably the rate at the end of the June quarter. Then it's like how much difference from the first quarter. Then it's calculated.

Then this can be calculated directly. Or there are other factors we have to consider. Of course, this is the Range that Pratamix refers to. I think it won't be much to do with this benchmark. Because Pratamix won't be much.

There are times when the second quarter is the whole quarter. A portfolio I think is still pretty much the same. I don't know how to calculate it anyway. Naturally, I did my best to do it. But you're right. em

Well, now we're too far ahead of the unconscious. Well, please, please just mention that tariffs have an impact. But now we see that the Lord sees how much tariffs are from Taiwan to the United States.

We are using it now. We are currently using 8473. The third we are going to be going in the month of Ramadan or tax-exempt years. The next question is whether the revenue in the second half of the year is better than the first half.

The second half of the year is going to be different. It's going to be an impact here. After all, you've come to a high level. Where's the top? Or maybe I'll talk to you all.

If you are looking for a place to stay for a year or two, then this is the place to stay for a year and a half; if you are looking for a place to stay for a year or two, then this is the place for you.

Everyone is scared. Now everyone is afraid. I just want to talk about the trend in front of me. It is to follow the trend in the right thing. Do the right thing.

That's limitless space. We have 2016 2026 27. We have so many things already ready. And I think yes. And it's also on the right one. One more trend.

So this is the time like GP200 300. GP many people are discussing this kind of smoothness is not going to happen. There is chaos in the order or growth.

And then there was a new creation. I think or a steady pace. We should do what we should do. Then growth is growth. The adjustment is to adjust.

So I said we are doing trending products. There are core technologies and there are trends. The future development is nature. Nature is the most beautiful.

I've always emphasized the beauty of nature. How not to force it. PRODAMIX is PRODAMIX. I've just said nothing about NIA. Strangely enough, some will use it.

The usage is also very beautiful. The usage rate is already up to 7%. So there are many variables. But there are still a lot of randomness. We are still strong. The next question is how to think about AI needs.

Here in the client side, the architecture of AMERICA corresponds to the AWS architecture. What is the growth rate. I came out of the GPU a year and a half ago.

AI will blossom for a while. You see. The whole application is now available. Google. AWS by Amazon. NV by NV.

Each one of them has been on the basis of AI. Then go slowly. Extend the KPI you want. At least Trump is working with each of them. Broadly and deeply speaking. The customer still trusts us.

The customer can still trust us, so the entire CSP is a growth. A trend driven by AI Media. I think that trend is no longer there. So, Mr. Trump is blossoming a lot.

The flowers are blooming, and then there are many different solutions.

The next question is: How much is the EQ25 blind rate due to product portfolio optimization? How much is the contribution of the exchange rate? To compare the biggest guarantee of the future of shareholders on March 33, 2025, March 33 and December, compared with the last year's December 31, 2024 exchange rate, comparison table, how much money should be, which I think is the product portfolio, or the core value of the product portfolio.

What is the impact of the exchange rate? I just said that the impact of the exchange rate is not a product portfolio, the product portfolio is a combination of thousands of more than 5,000 items, the one that is too difficult to calculate in a month, is optimization, has been optimizing your products, your competitiveness has been improving, and your competitiveness has been improving. What is the development and enthusiasm of CSP clients on the S1 project?

I don't need to go to the GB200 300, I think the current position of this series of products in Chun Lu, I don't need to go to him, sooner or later, or use, but one thing is not clear, Renninger Cup will come up, he will have moved up, so maybe last year will talk about GB200 changes or not, yeah, yeah, I said that so advanced technology in just a couple of years will integrate it, he will have a lot of bar, but there is still a mess of Renninger Cup is still in there, still stable, steady growth, or solid growth. The next question is: Ask the American factory's raw material procurement strategy, will use the local suppliers in the U.S.? Is there will not have a production line in the U.S. Is there?

The next question is: What is the change in the design of GB300 VHC and GB200? Is there a better chance of the car? In fact, the GB300 plan has not changed, just a problem with the schedule, its architecture has not changed, oh, I don't know how to do so many 200 architectures, I don't know why, but will you quit, or will you quit, the GB200 after the GB200 question, and then say again to solve it. The next question is: look at the future Taiwan dollar will enter the trend of long-term appreciation, then will the company's dollar will be safe or exchange of Taiwan coins? For example, say that it is now to 30 pieces, the U.S. dollar rate 4.5%, you have to gamble to 28 more or not bet, so, how much losses will be, that soon and that is the short-term factor, we are ourselves. The next question: Q25 product optimization and 4Q 24B What is the main aspect?

4Q Q1 high-level, in the past two years, all analysts in the low number of MLO 72 heavy weights Gross Margin will slash and then cause a lot of volatility in the market, in fact, the data has already said that everything does not need to be explained again, and then there is no strange thing in Platonics, which I also emphasize. Then GB200 was the beginning of November, this has proven that the past two years in nei literally nearly out of the icas Jenny this decisive about cum laude rais'RE, this is what I have been talking about to our shareholders, Qi Li Gao is a pressure, of course, but, but your technology is in the direction of all these new specifications, the role of Trump plays is really very important in this aspect of the organization, I believe that every CSP ODM, I believe that they are not like, but did not like to buy it, but the technology grew up in technology.

Please ask the traditional SERVER. Q1 needs and future mastery. You are still normal. I am stressed.

He is the author of the book, and the author of the book is the author of the book, and the author of the book is the author of the book, and the author of the book is the author of the book.

The next question is, can the 2Q gross profit margin be stable at 1Q? The higher the processing rate, the higher the gross profit margin. I have just said it. The currency is directly reducing the number.

That's what it looks like at home. Livefield can have a good run. That's a very important question because we now have a lot of money. A lot of money is in the currency.

We want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see.

We want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see.

We want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see, we want to see.

This is the truth of the matter, and the truth of the matter is that it is the truth of the matter, and that it is the truth of the matter, and that it is the truth of the matter, and that it is the truth of the matter, and that it is the truth of the truth of the matter.

You are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is.

It's a shame that other people are unhappy with their hair. It's a shame that it's at least our feet. The foot color has already made the company say.

The wind blows. The wind blows. The wind blows. We are the wind blows. The wind calms our shareholders. Don't feed. This is our function.

The next question is. The last company mentioned. The future power cabinet will also have the design business opportunities for rails. Please ask the power cabinet will not have the design business opportunities for rails.

It's the GP300. There are many how to set it up. You see it all the time. The GP200Rail. The GP300Rail PowerShell Rail has changed. It's still changing.

It's been a long time coming, so a lot of bugs need to be fixed, but it's really getting harder.

The bigger the technical challenge, the better. Did you hear it? It's clear. Vice President, I'm the financial valve in China. I'd like to ask.

You just said it. GP200 has been shipping. You've also said it. This change. GP200 and GP300 specifications. It's always changed.

So the GP200 still has a technical problem to solve. The second problem is that the GP300 contributes to our revenue this year. It may be slightly. But can you see it in the fourth quarter?

Thank you. I just said it. Anyway regardless of GP200 300. It is a trend in the industry. It is the trend of NV. It is only GP200 or 300.

The GP200 is still out now. I think it is still in order. No one here is what we see. I don't know how it is not in order. The GP300 says the truth. I'm not sure.

That is, it is really the decision of NV. Its interface is in the decision, so we see that it is stable to do so. It is not going down. It is going to grow slowly.

That's why I can explain. There is no problem with the current design architecture product. Just waiting for the chip. This is hard to answer for you. But I just said the mess in order.

Thank you. That's the next question. What are our capital expenditures this year and next year? Will it have an impact on gross profit margin if we have to take responsibility?

Normal all of these are well structured after. Our capital will be about $6M in a year. About $6M in a year. Yes. Depreciation Impacts. I think.

Negative value ratio. Our second plant. It had a good impact of 1.5% two years ago. Did you see it? It's already started contributing. So let's go back to the core competitiveness.

Yes, because it affects, the device is developed by itself.

There are not many capital expenditures. Then create maximum benefits. See. The cost rate is only up to 7%. It is already more than 7%.

Please apply the slides to when the bot will start contributing. It takes more to reach the obvious contribution. Vice President. Have you heard. Very clear. The next question is.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order into a coherent paragraph while retaining all the original information. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic or to the same person's speech and should be merged into paragraphs, while different topics or the content of different speakers need to be separated. Next, I will analyze sentences to determine which sentences can be combined into paragraphs.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sequence of paragraphs is consistent with the original transcription. For example, users refer to the section of the Vice President's shared vision, followed by questions about the impact of tariffs, which should be handled separately as they belong to different themes.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete or require context, but according to the user's request, no modifications can be made, only according to the original arrangement. It is also important to pay attention to situations in which Chinese and English are mixed, such as "Hong Kong dollar responses" and "nope", which need to be kept as they are, without translation or interpretation. At the same time, empty lines in timestamps (such as [2326. 90-2356. 90]) need to be retained, but the user may want these empty lines to be processed, so it is necessary to confirm whether they are deleted or not.

The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim script:. I don't have any comments on the robot slide. This is not a topic to discuss. Well, the next question is: Can the operating fee rate be based on a low 7.2%? 7.2%. I think I'll talk to you about 8.5% last year?

That's the way it is. I'm just talking about the right product on the right trend, and you have a strong patent R&D and manufacturing ability. Thank you.

[2326. 90-2356. 90] [2356. 90-2386. 90] [2386. 90-2416. 90] [2416. 90-2446. 90] [2446. 90] [2446. 90-2476. 90] [2446. 90] [2446. 90-2478. 90] Thank you.

What will happen in the next July? The whole thing is after July, and what will happen after they cut down. This is what we all have to pay tariffs, who will pay more, who will pay less. I think seniors or seniors should not change because of their layout, tariffs, and layout.

Thank you. What do you say about cookware? Is the current condition of the cookware affected by the global overall economy? I don't think there are any signs of early pull-ups. I don't know, everyone encounters, is paralyzed or what?

This piece of traditional kitchen utensils is also more obvious, is also more obvious, there is a question, whether to add orders or prices, he will compare the visibility of other areas of the order is relatively short? No. I don't think or normal, the traditional part is stable, the tradition is stable. Apply your Amanda, thank you. [2723. 52-2724. 80] The company is helping.

Family should be, the foreign part is not, the family should be around 53%. The foreign capital is, do not know, anyway, is a long-term shareholder. Time, after months of notice, you know it. Go to Promto to check out, and see which sovereign funds or funds in which coffees come in. Well, the next question is: how much space is there in the future to exclude the exchange rate factors?

So does CSP customer AISM have more needs for advanced features such as tool-free installation, VSD installation, or safety design? This industry uses these words to describe it, and it is difficult to explain. Right now, it is hard to say what the Maori is, but I still emphasize that we are going to do it.

That revenue comes, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it, you're winning it. [2907. 98-2908. 98]

So what if there is more SEEC and INFO-RAN trends in the future to see better growth in revenues and profits? I have always emphasized that Care these maori benefits, and they are not as big as taking your divisions to grow your revenues quickly. You see the last 20 months have been working in this direction, at the same time the economic scale has come up, the overall added value has come up, this is the layout, this is the desire of everyone's shareholders.

The next question is whether we can increase the dividend distribution rate in the future? But at the moment at 50% we can assign 50%, then we can grow the company's own future, a certain amount of nutrients, we can also assign it 50 pieces at a time, 50 pieces a year, to its own pocket, after all, after all, large shareholders or more than 50%, we do not think, you see a company listed from such a small number of people companies, then there are so many cash, and so much money, so much money, and so much money can be done, this is a business perspective, this is perfect, that short-term shareholders will want to allocate more, that the future, and we do not know what is the next time, and the next time, we will not only the future?
