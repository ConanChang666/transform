<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and kept the original intention intact.

For example, [0.0 00-2.00] Yagio's first quarter results, followed by greetings and introductions. I need to arrange these in chronological order and combine the sentences of the same topic into paragraphs while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same paragraph. For example, the introduction section may include greetings, thank you participation, company introduction, etc.

There may be transition sentences in the middle, such as "next page" or "next page", which may need to be handled separately, or as a separation between paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may be duplicated or redundant, such as "ten-tenths of battery providers and ten-tenths of battery providers", which may need to be kept as the same, even if it looks duplicated. In addition, some sentences may be grammatical errors or coherent, but cannot be modified according to user requirements, and can only retain the original sentences. During the processing process, I will check a few sentences on timestamps to make sure that nothing is missing. For example, after [81. 00-92.], there are several financial data sentences that need to be arranged logically, which may be divided into revenue, cost growth, industry average comparison, etc.

In addition, be aware of the mixed parts of Chinese and English, such as "Across China," and "and the board." These may need to be kept as it is, even if they look uncoherent. The user may want to keep the integrity of the original script, including possible spelling errors or duplications. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph-coupled text to ensure that all sentences are correctly categorized without omissions or wrong sequences. At the same time, check that the format meets the requirements without using any Markdown, keep the plain text.

Hello everyone, good morning. Thank you for joining us today on Yagio's first quarter results live. Yagio is the world's largest provider and the top 10 battery provider and the top ten battery provider. My name is Howard Kao and I am Morgan Stanley's consultant analyst. We are pleased to have David Wong President, Eddie Chen President, CFO and Claudio Lalini President of Global Sales & Marketing, today with us to share their discussion and commentary.

As well as the discussion on the market. The management team will first pass the first quarter results. And some reviews looking forward. Then we will open it up to the question bar. When doing a web show at any time. You can see our video.

You can post your question in your video. Now I would like to transfer the comment bar to Eddie and David's open statement. Thank you. You can do the financial report directly. Thank you. Yes, David.

Dear investors, good morning. Thank you for participating in our first quarter results meeting. As always, let me introduce you to the top players in the first quarter of the financial performance. Well, 25 years in the first quarter, we produced 31.100 million revenues in the first quarter. The cost of the first quarter is 3.7% growth.

On the market budget, the cost of the first quarter is. The first quarter starts to grow. As you can see, the cost of the first quarter is 35.6%. It is a 2.5 percent increase in the first quarter.

So, the industry has grown even more on average. For example, 28.8%. Or 2.9% higher than the previous quarter. Or 3.4% higher than the previous year. EBITDA also shows the same trend in the same quarter. Therefore, the cost of this quarter is $5 billion in taxes.

Or the growth of 49.1%, more growth than the previous quarter. EPS grew at $10.77 per share. Of course, the growth of the online market also grew from the execution of other business aspects. Especially the quality of the AI-type, which we will talk about later in the analysis.

We will be on the later growth,.. More growth.. Next page. I will be in this chart,.. from a different angle,.. in the sales analysis,.

If you look at the product, you can see that. All the resistors and energy show good news in the growth of the previous quarter. If you look at the analysis in the first quarter, you can see that.

The cost of Tantulum is rising in sales scores. The cost of MLCC is also growing. The same is true, and these are related to the demand for high AI content. So, the boycotts of Tantulum MLCC are on the rise. All of them are growing.

On the other hand, theoretically, since the items are automatically transferred, therefore, theoretically, theoretically,

In theory, in theory, in theory, in theory, in theory, in theory, if you look at the analysis, I think,

We still see the cost of AI content showing good news in growth. We still see the cost of AI content showing good news in growth. Therefore,. Costs in training and training engineering show good news in growth. Business is still on the rise, and business is still on the rise.

We see a good cost in the Chinese market. Costs in the U.S. and the Ima market have decreased. So,. We see the good news that items in the auto-transfer show.

In addition, the Japanese market has a very strong. Second, the Japanese market tones down, that is, the local saving probability project. It has a deep weakness.

Across China, the U.S. market has been an additional hardening in the past few quarters, continuing at more than 27%. Other countries in China, I think the market has been strengthened by the demand for AI and EV.

If you look at the distribution of this channel, you can see that the world distribution businessman seems to be dragging. If you look at the first quarter of the country, it gains momentum there. This situation, it seems to be controlling the truck situation there.

Next. Let's take a look. The quality of the truck for this trolley. Free truck traffic. It's ugly, it's ugly.

In the previous quarter, we saw some investors. Successful success was successful and successful. There were also some earnings. You see,

We will be there in the fourth quarter, unless you see, every quarter, we think we're in development, most of us have a very stable.

And the rich truck traffic. This is a pair of groups. It's brilliant. And the rich truck traffic. This helps. Asia is more truck traffic.

Increased revenue. Increased revenue. If you look, you'll see. Over the past 12 months, our truck traffic has dropped.

About 20%. During the quarter, we are in the fourth quarter. 17%. If this continues, we will see soon.

This truck traffic. Become. A positive truck traffic. Next, we will see. Our truck traffic.

The truck traffic. Minimum truck traffic. Well, we'll see. This time the truck traffic.

It will be.. in.. very high.. the traffic of the truck.. period, and..

Market. Truck traffic. . Class truck traffic. . Class truck traffic.

We will see, yes, yes, today, 10 weeks, the market.

We have submitted our response to their first list of questions. And then we have another round of interactions on March 26, where we submit the answers to those questions from Shibaura.

We are currently working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are currently working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. We are working on a new project. I think we have already communicated with our investors that we have a long time in the past couple of years YAGEO is very hard trying to transform ourselves from the standard product focused companies to premium product focused companies we also try to find for the better balanced of the business others and other product portfolios so we believe that the newer quarter's performance and the improvement is that the stronger evidence of this transformation. Now the Q2 is so if we see the sales that we are showing is the lower one, then we expect the higher margin percentage and the lower margin will be higher than the lower quarter and then we see the lower portion of the book.

We're going to go into the Q&A review now. Please ask a question on your computer and we'll do it in a short time. We'll wait for your review. First of all, I'd like to mention your Q1's maximum. I think it's stronger. Stronger than your initial guide.

I am sure the QQ you are expecting is relatively strong.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I read the entire transcript, identifying the start timestamps of each sentence, and paying attention to the structure of the conversation. It looks like a record of a meeting or interview, with questions and answers alternated. For example, the questioner asks Q1 to reach 4% of the comment color, followed by questions about whether there are protesters' guidance, and then questions about unforeseen free propaganda. The answer section involves the company's analysis, regional performance, production base distribution, and so on. Next, I need to group these sentences logically to form a natural paragraph. For example, the question section may need to maintain the independence of each question, and the answer section needs to merge sentences of the same topic.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural and does not compromise the original sequence of time. During the process, some non-Chinese content, such as "waking up to what iskraven" or parts of a mixed language, such as "kami sed devastating news" and "긠교교 교肢 도000", may be encountered.

In addition, some sentences may have overlaps or intervals between timestamps, such as [955. 18-956. 18] and [958. 18-959. 18], which may indicate a pause or switch topic in the conversation. It is necessary to ensure that these intervals are correctly reflected in paragraphs, which may be handled by empty lines or paragraphs. When handling mixed or non-Chinese content, it is necessary to confirm whether the original data belongs to the user. For example, "기VISION 교肢 도000" may be a Korean or some coding error, but upon the user's request, it is necessary to keep the same.

When organizing paragraphs, also pay attention to the continuity of the conversation. For example, the transition between the questioner and the answerer should be clear and may be distinguished by a line change or indentation. At the same time, make sure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order to maintain the original timestamp order. Finally, after completing the initial draft, it is necessary to read the entire paragraph-crossing text again, verify that there is no missing sentences, that all content is preserved as it is, and that the paragraphs are properly divided, in line with the user's reading habits.

[850. 18-852. 18] But the magnitude of your Q1 reaches 4%. [852. 18-854. 18] What color is your comment? [854. 18-860. 18] Is there any guidance provided by some protesters? [860. 18-869. 18] Or some free propaganda that you didn't expect before the end of Q1?

[869. 18-882. 18] What is your review? [872. 18-878. 18] Yes, I would like to try adding some colors. [878. 18-881. 18] We asked ourselves the same question, [881. 18-884. 18]

[884. 18-893. 18] But frankly, we may have some protests in some customers or channels. [893. 18-896. 18] But if so, that is the least. [896. 18-897. 18] The biggest factor is, [897. 18-902. 18] The stronger the result of our highest line, [902. 18-911. 18] is the part that has been done well in Q1. [911. 18-891. 18] For example, the continent-based region.

[917. 18-919. 18] Then, in the area,. [919. 18-921. 18] We have AI-linked applications, [921. 18-924. 18] Computers, devices, and transmitters. [924. 18-826. 18] There are also global transmissions. [926. 18-29. 18] All of them were mentioned by Eddie. [929. 18-931. 18] We were in 2024, 2024.

[931. 18-934. 18] We experienced most of the analysis. [934. 18-937. 18] Beginning in 2025, we saw the health of our channel. [937. 18-941. 18] We have a little progress, [941. 18-943. 18] We have decided to make a stronger analysis. [943. 18-950. 18] This more explains our expected results. [950. 18-955. 18]

[955. 18-956. 18] waking up to what iskraven [958. 18-959. 18] This community is not only because of the disease that many members have stunned samples, [959. 18-980. 18] kami sed devastating news that [980. 18-9832. 38] 긱visual 교肢 도000. [982. 38-984. 98] Flat-photo- [985. 18-991. 18] That is, you know, those colors are because you import in the United States? [99. 18-996. 18] So, the cost of your imports are global distributors in the United States.

[996. 18-1000. 18] The cost will be some load, right? [1000. 18-1004. 18] This is the way to look at the direct impact of these loads. [1005. 18-1009. 18] I asked Kradio, would he solve this problem? [1009. 18-1019. 18] Yes, as David said, the load is not something new to us and our industry.

[1019. 18-1023. 18] Currently, influence is controllable. [1023. 18-1034. 18] It is difficult to say numbers, but frankly, the message is always changing and the number is changing, too. [1034. 18-1036. 18] The import date is also changing. [1036. 18-1038. 18] For some countries, [1038. 18-1039. 18] For example, USA, [1039. 18-1041. 18] They are on the list of numbers,

[1041. 18-1043. 18] Later the numbers on the list were dropped, [1043. 18-1046. 18] or dropped in a procrastination period. [1046. 18-1050. 18] So, we planned on a variety of modes, [1050. 18-1055. 18] In all these cases, we have several guidance. [1055. 18-1059. 18] First of all, we were very able to carry out the load, [1059. 18-1065. 18] because of the size of our manufacturing projects.

[1065. 18-1068. 18] This does not mean that we can change the production immediately. [1068. 18-1072. 18] is the production of countries B from A. [1072. 18-1081. 18] However, we have more than 20 countries in production. [1081. 18-1084. 18] Add to that we have truck mills and sales companies, [1084. 18-1087. 18] so we are able to better manage the truck, [1087. 18-1090. 18] is better than many of our colleagues.

[1090. 18-1097. 18] In addition, we have quite good discussions with our customers and channels in the United States. [1097. 18-1101. 18] Our production and a large number of colleagues are in the same situation. [110. 18-1106. 18] We have a lot to talk about how to adjust the situation. [1106. 18-1108. 18] But throughout the industry, [1108. 18-1114. 18] We think these productions are our control. [1114. 18-1119. 18] This may change some of our customers' footprint decisions.

[1119. 18-1125. 18] But I think that this began on the highs of the supply chain, and [1125. 18-1128. 18] Our production will decrease even more. [1128. 18-1133. 18] And we also think that our production will end too quickly. [1133. 18-1134. 18] In summary, [1134. 18-1136. 18] We are a company, [1136. 18-1138. 18] We believe that our impact is feasible.

[1138. 18-1147. 18] But we think we will have a great impact before we run. [1147. 18-1149. 18] Thank you. [1149. 18-1154. 18] You mentioned that the basis of production you and I work with is 30 countries. [1153. 18-1154. 18] Or that the basis of production you and I work with is 30 countries, [1154. 18-1157. 18] We have more than 30 countries in the world. [1157. 18-1162. 18] Can you give us some advanced distribution?

[1162. 18-1164. 18] In the big field, [1164. 18-1171. 18] What mass distribution can we offer? [1171. 18-1175. 18] I can answer your questions. [1175. 18-1179. 18] We have more than 30 production bases outside of China.

[1179. 18-1182. 18] We are in the industry in the 19th and 20th centuries. [1182. 18-1184. 18] We are in the industry in the 19th and 20th centuries. [1184. 18-1186. 18] Regardless of which cities have any jobs, we rely on calculation and expression of production base. [1188. 18-1182. 18] There is still a large number. [1192. 18-1192. 18] Almost every technology is lacking in production in some countries.

[1202. 18-1210. 18] We do not disclose the value of value and weight. [1210. 18-1213. 98] We do not publish this data frequently. [1213. 98-1215. 90] But we have the opportunity. [1215. 90-1219. 30] Use any technology to rely on it. [1219. 30-1223. 18] Usually two if not more countries. [1223. 18-1226. 50] This has always been a benefit.

[1226. 50-1227. 78] is more than just a cost. [1227. 78-1229. 66] It is indeed the case. [1229. 66-1233. 74] Risks in other areas widen. [1233. 74-1237. 06] is also meant to be close to customers. [1237. 06-1240. 46] Short and short-term options. [1240. 46-1243. 98] and costs are reduced.

[1243. 98-1245. 22] Dantrum is a good example. [1245. 22-1248. 02-1250. 66] We have actions in China. [1250. 66-1252. 18] We have actions in Thailand. [1252. 18-1254. 58] We have actions in Mexico. [1254. 58-1256. 42] Dantrum is one.

[1256. 42-1258. 50] Dantrum's actions. [1258. 50-1260. 74] This provides a lot of software to our customers. [1260. 74-1263. 10] in China and the United States. [1263. 10-1265. 18] and the United States. [1265. 18-1267. 02] Dantrum's goods. [1267. 02-1269. 02] We also have very high goods.

[1269. 02-1271. 62] These goods are in the present high value. [1271. 62-1273. 02] is very high value. [1276. 02-1276. 98] understood. [1276. 98-1280. 42] then on Dantrum. [1280. 42-1282. 38] Review. [1282. 38-1285. 10] I think the most recent news.

[1285. 10-1287. 34] There are some price increases. [1287. 34-1290. 14] Dantrum's battery. [1290. 14-1293. 06] You can give some comments. [1293. 06-1293. 82] Yes. [1293. 82-1295. 18] Yes. [1295. 18-1296. 86] So.

[1297. 02-1298. 98] originally had duck. [1298. 98-1301. 78] trivial [1301-1304. 14] For this is a sure-fire index. [1304. 14-1305. 26] I think. [1305. 50-1316. 74] What our own taste is. [1316. 74-1319. 58] What is always there. [1319. 58-1320. 02] Is not.

[1320. 02-1321. 14] The whole route. [1321. 14-1323. 34] is also the most deny for us. [1323. 34-1324. 70] Both internships. [1324. 70-1325. 18] The whole interface. [1325. 18-1325. 58] Everything. [1325. 58-1326. 42] Their purpose.

[1326. 42-1327. 02] We are in front of our friends. [1327. 02-1330. 02] We want to make sure that our balance is correct. [1330. 02-1333. 02] In this case. [1333. 02-1335. 02] We find. [133]

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like it is divided into multiple timestamps and corresponding sentences, some of which may belong to the same topic and need to be merged into paragraphs. For example, the first part is "Thank you", "Comment again", "In the professional portfolio of Tantalum," etc. These may belong to the same paragraph. Next is a discussion about professional language, which may need to be segmented. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or conversational process.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, but the user may want to ignore the timestamp, only retain the content. Therefore, I need to remove the timestamp, only keep the sentence content and segment it according to the logic. During the processing process, there may be some repeated or interrupted sentences, such as "thank you" or duplicated questions, which need to be kept the same, but reasonable segmentation.

Also, be aware that some sentences may not be coherent or grammatical errors, but they cannot be modified according to user requirements and can only be retained as they are. For example, a repetitive "professional" in the professional portfolio of Tantalum company needs to be retained. Finally, make sure that there is a proper line between each paragraph to make the overall structure clear while keeping all the original content not lost.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for there is no man like unto thee; neither is there any man like unto thee, neither is there any man like unto thee.

Mainly on paper and computer, or computer, there is no professional language, but it does not have a professional language, but I can speak.

Most of these words are in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah, and in the Sunnah and in the Sunnah.

Again, there are some frequently asked questions. Please ask if you have a target for usage of your goods and offers in Q1 and Q2. Thank you. The usage rate of Q2 will increase slightly. So the rule for usage in Q1 is about 60%.

So from 60% to 65% this is normal. The goods in Q1 are about 70%. So the goods in Q2 are increased to 75%. At present, we see that the prices of the goods are still high. And in Q2 we expect sales to grow.

Thank you. Your Q2 income index is lower than the monthly growth of the first grade. I think there are a lot of levels in history. The front line of Q2 you can say that you see this year is lower than the first grade Q2 growth how to comply with the historical quarter is high or low.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

We continue to see the need for computers to be healthy. Consideration of re-growth activities. As well as China's EV level and global Chinese market continue to give us confidence. We are still at risk of moving forward in Europe.

Industrial and motor vehicles in the western world are still at risk of moving forward. Compared to last year when we packed all of them together. We believe that Q2 will grow gradually. And Q1 we do not expect it to be lower.

Because invited will also go to altre Hunan and Taiwan Book. This mentions that we often look forward to overseas blessings U.S. ursu pictures may not attack or determine the order. At present we do not see. So we have plans to grow. At least we have. So we are still looking at it.

Thank you. Is it reasonable to say that these guidelines are based on the basis of the eternal cryptocurrency. This is the first question. The second question is what do you expect from the second half.

There is nothing to see about your second half. The phenomenon of my expenses includes the global economy because of the cost. These issues are very motivating. So we have to provide our detailed guidance for the second half. I think it is very difficult. So the best guidance we can give you right now is Q2 Dunklaud you have more reviews.

No. The same comment Bewen. Okay, thank you. There is another question about your evolution program sorry evolution program you can't say that he's right for Żeelyanda. We're because we're developing the world's newest system and they don't need any standards to officially develop our mountain still firmly towards the art envolved race we AI on it.

1. Retain all original content (including duplicate "thank you", breakage, timestamp corresponding content) 2. Adjust only the punctuation and paragraph separation, not modify any original statement. 3. Retain special characters and suspected garbled (such as "Żeelyanda", "mountain", etc.) 4. Semantic logic segmentation, but not merge or split the original statement.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription fragments and organize them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it is necessary to keep the original, just adjust the structure. Next, I will check the transcription content provided. Some parts may contain non-Chinese characters or misspellings, such as '''', 'ii',', 'u', ', ', 'i', ', ', ', ', ', ', ' etc., these may be voice recognition errors or noise in the original audio.

This requires identifying logical relationships between sentences, such as Q&A, topic conversion, etc. For example, users mentioned about the comparison of items to Nexensus, CAPEX instructions, analysis of the Chinese market, etc., may need to be segmented. At the same time, pay attention to the mapping of timestamps to ensure that each sentence is correctly positioned. For example, [1816. 82-1818.02] We really experience each sentence, and then it is differentiated, and then ii because these may be at the beginning of the same paragraph, which need to be sequenced.

In addition, some sentences may be repeated three times, such as "this also has a good progress", and need to be kept as if they were not merged or deleted. There is also a need to be kept in the same way about the repeated contents of the currency. During the processing process, there may be some difficult sentences, such as "Our new stock will continue" or "The income we make will be lost as well." These may need to be kept in the original, but make sure that they are in the correct position in the paragraph. Finally, make sure that the entire paragraphs are smooth, though they cannot be modified, but by correct segmentation and sequence of sentences, so that the overall structure is clearer.

After finishing the preliminary finishing, I will check again to see if any sentences are missing and make sure that all the timestamps and content are correct. At the same time, make sure that nothing is added or deleted, and that it is handled exactly as the user requests.

We have also made a lot of effort to connect with the Asian IT system, which also has a great progress. This also has a great progress, which will also have more progress in the continuous time, and will have more progress, but in these respects, we will get, as expected, this year, we will also have a great progress in monetary terms.

Yes, we continue, just like any of our companies, our currency updates are our top advantage. There is no other connection we maintain. So, I would say, we have a lot of gain in the 12 months. Now, before progress, we will have more profit, and we will have more profit, but our measure will be more than the top three yan Our new stock will continue to lose if we can provide your CAPEX instructions? These questions may be more suitable for Eddie. I don't know if I have instructions for the whole year, but in the first quarter, we spent about $4 billion.

I think CAPEX will pay more attention to production this year, as well as the style of certain projects. So I think this is the best choice we have seen at the moment, but I have no indication of CAPEX throughout the year.

Thank you. Again, let's take a look at the principles and offers your business is being transferred. In the last quarter, you mentioned that the BP ratio for both items reached 1 or more.

We think we can keep this speed. At present, we see that the BP ratio, all this electricity is a little less, but they obviously think that Jun project is a past few months of probability, SO etc. every day in this aire continues to count as 은, address, with a continuous ratio, the order and the average quality of the wires, of course, all only 2440 nước gift créd look at besonders, and you see the events posted at the end of the event, in other regions, but what is the forecast color of China's business? We look at the Chinese market from a different point of view. We have a different perspective.

We have a huge regional carrier connection in China. We also have a lot of EMS angles, built on equipment that is related to AI. This is beneficial for the behavior of computers, tapes, mobile phones, transmitters, etc. We also have an EV level in many regions of the region of production.

We look at China's development, we see China's development in the last year and a half. We see all of these parts working very well together. The transmission channels in the region did not do well in the previous years. But last year, it had a great growth, it started in Q1, with a trend. So, at least for us, at the moment, I have to say that the growth of Chinese businesses, at all points of view I mentioned earlier, in all of the global channels, the level of EV, may not be too big in the industry, but in China, what we do is not a big part.

So at Q1, they all did very well, in fact, we all did very well. Thank you, sorry, I just didn't understand, but on Q2's guidance, from an analytical point of view, what methods do you have to help us in terms of technology, in many ways, which transmitters would be better than other transmitters, such as MLCCs, resistors, which would be faster than other transmitters? For Q2, I can say that our products, such as Tantalum, especially Tantalum, are used in all applications, and their speeds are expected to continue doing well.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

For example, some sentences may be incomplete, or there is a duplicate "thank you" section. I need to make sure to keep the original intention in the conversion process while making the paragraph more natural and smooth. Next, I will analyze sentences in a sentence to determine which sentences are in the same topic or conversational rotation for a reasonable segmentation. For example, the first part of the discussion may be less, followed by a comparison of the Q2 operation speed, and then the question about fin price adjustment.

At the same time, you need to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the converted paragraph timestamp corresponds correctly. For example, a sentence from [2332. 62-2334. 62] to [2341. 62] may belong to the same paragraph, while the subsequent [2342. 62-2344. 62] is a new content.

In addition, the user mentions that "do not delete any sentences" is key, so even if some sentences look incomplete or duplicated, such as multiple "thank you", it also needs to be retained. For example, from [2520. 62-2529. 62] continuous "thank you" may need to be kept as it is, but can be properly combined to reduce the repetitive feeling, but the user explicitly requests not to be deleted, so it must be kept completely. During the process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the language's continuity. For example, some sentences may need to adjust the punctuation or connection after conversion to make the paragraph more smoother. For example, "understand, thank you." and "this is a very good" combined into more coherent sentences, may need to add appropriate or adjust the structure, but must ensure that the original intent is not changed.

In addition, be careful to deal with possible spelling mistakes or non-standard expressions such as "meteoro" and "ammunition" may require confirmation of correct terms, but user requirements do not change, so keep it as it is. Similarly, Russian or Chinese mixed parts such as "[2393. 62-2394.78] чубы do a rich one," need to retain the original phrase even if the language is inconsistent. Finally, after the conversion, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to check whether all sentences are properly preserved, whether the paragraphs are reasonably segmented, whether the timestamps correspond correctly, and whether the texts are consistent with the user's requirements.

[2334. 62-2341. 62] Because of their items. [2341. 62-2341. 62] Understands, thank you. [2344. 62-2344. 62] This is very very. [2344. 62-2347. 62] View from the map point of view, [2347. 62-23341. 62] Or view, [2349. 62-2351. 62] Q2 operating speed,

[2351. 62-2355. 62] should be quite similar, [2355. 62-2356. 62] e.g., [2356. 62-2358. 62] China could do better, [2358. 62-2360. 62] In the case of Q2, [2360. 62-2336. 62] For Europe or other regions. [2363. 62-2356. 62] I think this is true.

[2365. 62-2367. 62] Understand, thank you. [2367. 62-2369. 62] Let's take a look at it again. [2369. 62-2371. 62] Tantalum price adjustment, [2371. 62] This is a big one, it's a big one. [2373. 62-2376. 62] Funding guidance for the second quarter, [2375. 62-2376. 62] For this field,

[2376. 62-2378. 62] Is there any change? [2378. 62-2379. 62] Yes,. [2379. 62-2380. 62] We are in the field of the second quarter, [2380. 62-2381. 62] We have a big, large, [2381. 62-2338. 62].

[2389. 62-2393. 62] Big, big. [2384. 62-2385. 62] What is the specific field? [2384. 62] meteoro, [2387. 62-2389. 62] So ammunition, [2389. 62-2393. 62] We are going to trade. [2389. 62-2393. 62] Ok. [2393. 62-2393. 78] чобы do a rich job.

[2394. 78-2395. 62] Optimization. [2395. 62-2393. 62] Here I remix, [2397. 62-2398. 62] I can only come out, [2398. 62-2411. 62] If you want to remove. [2411. 62-2412. 62] Let's take a look, [2412. 62-2413. 62] is Wu Min 6000,

[2413. 62-2416. 62] We are glad to have this way. [2416. 62-2419. 62] But this price adjustment. [2419. 62-2422. 62] is not one. [2422. 62-2425. 62] Balancing adjustment. [2425. 62-2428. 62] So the growth you see. [2428. 62-2431. 62] is mainly used to adjust the amount.

[2433. 62-2435. 62] Understand, thank you. [2435. 62-2448. 62] Your second quarter budget. [2438. 62-2441. 62] What is it? [2441. 62-2444. 62] We see good. [2444. 62-2446. 62] OP margin growth. [2446. 62-2448. 62] and GM.

[2450. 62-2452. 62] We can expect it. [2452. 62-2454. 62] Similar OP margin. [2454. 62-2456. 62] growth. [2456. 62-2458. 62] Sorry, OP margin. [2458. 62-2446. 62] on the second quarter budget. [2460. 62-2446. 62] growth, so OP margin.

[2462. 62-2464. 62] Growth is higher than growth. [2464. 62-2466. 62] This is what we can expect. [2466. 62-2468. 62] I would like to be in the best guidance. [2468. 62-2470. 62] We can see. [2470. 62-2472. 62] The budget we see. [2472. 62-2473. 62] Within the quarter.

[2473. 62-2475. 62] There will be a slight increase. [2475. 62-2447. 62] So we will see. [2477. 62-2479. 62] More accurate numbers. [2482. 62-2485. 62] Understand, thank you. [2486. 62-2488. 62] Then there is a problem. [2488. 62-2490. 62] About shopping.

[2490. 62-2491. 62] Well, you know. [2491. 62-2493. 62] How much shopping. [2493. 62-2495. 62] I think shopping day. [2495. 62-2496. 62] You know when. [2496. 62-24971. 62] Within the end of the day. [24971. 62-2499. 62] You know we want to.

[2499. 62-2501. 62] After the next period. [2501. 62-2503. 62] How to estimate the shopping day. [2503. 62-2504. 62] I think. [2504. 62-2506. 62] After the first quarter. [2506. 62-2509. 62] Within 127 days. [2509. 62-2511. 62] Compared to four seasons.

[2511. 62-2513. 62] 124 days to 125 days. [2513. 62-2515. 62] I think. [2515. 62-2517. 62] After the second quarter. [2517. 62-2519. 62] Should be quite stable. [2519. 62-2520. 62] Okay, thank you. [2520. 62-2521. 62] Thank you.

[2521. 62-2522. 62] Thank you. [2522. 62-2523. 62] Thank you. [2523. 62-2524. 62] Thank you. [2524. 62-2525. 62] Thank you. [252525. 62-2526. 62] Thank you. [2526. 62-2527. 62] Thank you.

[2527. 62-2528. 62] Thank you. [2528. 62-2529. 62] Thank you. [2529. 62-2530. 62] Thank you. [2531. 62-2532. 62] Thank you. [2536. 62-2537. 62] Thank you. [2537. 62-2538. 62] Thank you.

[2545. 62-2548. 62] Thank you. [2548. 62-2550. 62] Thank you. [2556. 62-2557. 62] Thank you. [2557. 62-2566. 62] It is hard to believe that when we talk to them, I do not feel there is a natural decision. [2566. 62-2557. 62] To prevent a large number of core costs accelerate in the preparation of heart costs. [2572. 62-2554. 62] Some may be, but this is the least.

[2574. 62-2581. 62] We see a special motivator for the spread of business around the world. [2581. 62-258. 62] This is mainly because in these two years they have been talking about, and they are now being judged on healthier products. [2594. 62-2581. 62] They are more confident in ending the sale of the market. [2599. 62-260. 62] So they are now offering to more US dollars. [2603. 62-2606.6. 62] They think they can provide more dollars.

[2606. 62-2608. 62] That's great. [2608. 62-2612. 62] We are all waiting for this moment. [2612. 62-2616. 62] This growth is slow, but it is quite stable. [2616. 62-2620. 62] I think this is the correct method. [2620. 62-2622. 62] For the Asian part, [2622. 62-2624. 62] This growth is more intense.

[2624. 62-2626. 62] As I said, it started a year ago. [2626. 62-2628. 62] And for the spread of business around the world, [2628. 62-2632. 62] This quarter was their first quarter growth, [2632. 62-2633. 62] Compared to historically. [2633. 62-2637. 62] So I think this is a little less relevant to growth. [2640. 62-2642. 62] Understand, thank you.

[2642. 62-2649. 62] And in your.... [2652. 62-2668. 62] Sorry, in your ability in China, we have a problem. [2668. 62-2660. 62] Can you tell us what your usage rate in China is? [2668. 62-2647. 62] Can you share it with us? [2671. 62-2677. 62]

[2677. 62-2680. 62] We have many industries, [2680. 62-2682. 62] We have many industries, [2682. 62-2683. 62] We have a lot of industries, [2683. 62-2685. 62] So on the global utilization rate, [2685. 62-2687. 62] I can give you some reviews. [2687. 62-2689. 62] You can share your utilization rate with us.

[2689. 62-2691. 62] Our utilization rate is 65%, [2691. 62-2694. 62] Our industry is 75%. [2694. 62-2700. 62] Understand, understand, thank you. [2700. 62-27064. 62] Then, about capacity problems, [2706. 62-279. 62] Do you have the capacity in the United States? [2709. 62-2712. 62] Now, if so.

[2712. 62-2716. 62] Can we know what industry is? [2717. 62-2719. 62] Very very very very.
