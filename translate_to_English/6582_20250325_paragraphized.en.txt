Thank you to everyone who was present and online. I would like to introduce the whole training camp and review the fourth quarter first. If you have any questions, please ask me. OK I will go to the third page of the presentation. There are about a few parts of the presentation today. We will have a simple formula to introduce the product sales.

Our company was founded in 1979. At present, we have about 153 people. It is a medium-sized enterprise. After we went public in 2017, we became a few listed companies in Pingtung.

We currently have all of our factories and major offices. All of them are in Taiwan. We are currently the government in a reasonable procurement plan. Our main product is synthetic latex. The polymerization technology of synthetic emulsification polymerization is our core technology. Our upstream is probably the raw material of the petrochemical industry.

We then go downstream to a wide range of synthetic latex applications. Whether in the medical or electronic industry, paper or environmental protection industries, etc. We are currently the world's seventh-largest manufacturer of low-grade latex. Our main products are used in this section. The first one is a disposable gloves for medical examination electronics.

We will use paper cloth and cotton on paper. At the same time, it can be a good binder for environmentally friendly building materials. Because we are a water-based material, so it is environmentally friendly and non-toxic and priceless.

We all use it or after a long 10-year recession. It doesn't produce any ruptures. Of course, we are also one of the supply chains for electric vehicles. East is used in this power outage device and part of the battery.

Our main products are sold. Our main products are sold. 24% are domestic and then the rest are exported. About seven Chengdu is based in Asia.

Gloves this tattoo glove it was originally made of natural rubber. So the progress of this whole Supply Chain is in Southeast Asia. Especially in Malaysia. We also have a technical service office in Malaysia. OK We look at 2024. We also have a technical service office in Malaysia.

Revenue in 2024 was around 1.7 billion. It increased by 52% compared to the same period last year. Our business experience was a loss of 64 million. It also made a lot of progress compared to last year.

Our out-of-the-box earnings are mainly derived from the interest income of each commodity operating. It is not a one-time bonus. So it is very stable. You can see the side effects of our interview later.

Fixed income types. The product is also based on the assets of Taiwan Dollar. The assets of Taiwan Dollar account for about 70%. So we are also affected by the impact of foreign exchange. It is also relatively small. The external income of this industry is relatively stable.

That should be a special supplement to the description. Regarding the outside gains part of the industry. We are not. We are not. A long time. Operation carried out. Mainly because.

We found a suitable place to do it. The funding for parking. Then we will still focus on the industry in the future. Upstream and downstream, as well.

Capacity development is mainly. The whole tax experience in 2024. It is likely that we will, so this year's equity policy is to pay a bit of money.

All the results are matched. Let's look at the EPS of science and technology, as well as the performance and performance of the national power.

First of all, you can see. The downstream part of this year. That's what we're doing. A successful retrospective of 2024. It's also very close to the level in this industry.

From the first quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024. You can see one. Step-by-step progress. There. Part of the third quarter says why. It jumps right away.

This is due to the peak period of the share distribution. So this part is correct, but can be seen in the fourth quarter of 2024. It has been very close to the level. We believe.

In the future, we will continue to make adjustments to optimize our product registration. That part should be getting better. In the future, we have several parts in the direction of development. Synthetic latex and even latex as well as this nanochemical product. Mainly our products.

This. A sound product portfolio and this development of high-grade products. That is, in the glove part is mainly modified. Whether it is corrosion resistance. corrosion resistance and then soluble resistance. High strength and high elasticity of these.

This part is mainly made of nanoscale and self-made and raw materials. We are on the raw materials. We are on the customer's process. It has very high stability. And it has a water-based relationship with cleaning.

So its cost. The cycle will be relative to this process. Very easy to clean. Environmentally friendly materials. Environmentally friendly materials and environmentally friendly materials. Government green regulations.

No. The government of Taiwan or this North American region. This environmental law in Japan or the Middle East. That includes this. Sandalwood is not allowed to use this plastic.

We have been blessed with green leaves, and we have been blessed with green leaves, and we have been blessed with green leaves, and we have been blessed with green leaves.

That's all. In fact, it can all be used. synthetic latex way to go. OK that sums it up. 2024.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts:. [473. 12-475. 68] This does not go out of stock after the pandemic afternoon. [475. 68-476. 72] This is what your terminal needs. [476. 76-477. 52] Natural growth. [477. 52-478. 80] Self-confidence gloves demand. [478. 80-480. 08] This is normal.

[480. 08-482. 64] So in 2024 a reasonable income of 1.7 billion. [482. 64-483. 68] Maori is. [483. 68-485. 98] 1.4 billion gross profit margin of 8. 7%. [485. 98-487. 52] The net profit of that business is [487. 52-489. 04] -6000 million. [489. 04-491. 60] Operating profit margin is -4%.

[491. 60-493. 14] The ex-industrial income is 1.600 million. [493. 14-495. 70] Therefore, the net profit of the company belonging to the net profit is after tax. [495. 70-496. 48] New Taiwan dollar. [496. 48-498. 00] 100 million. [498. 00-498. 78] OK. [498. 78-501. 34] The CCP completed ISO in 2024.

[501. 34-503. 90] The greenhouse variance of 14064. [503. 90-506. 20] Except for category two. [506. 20-510. 04] The city also began to conduct three categories of four inspections. [510. 04-0513. 12] And the third row was verified. [513. 12-515. 16] In terms of energy improvement in its operations. [515. 16-56. 44] Except for boilers.

[516. 44-518. 74] No longer uses boiler maintenance. [518. 74-520. 02] No longer uses re-ceramic. [520. 02-522.2. 08] All of them use outsourced steam. [522.0 08-523. 60] to improve the efficiency of burning food. [523. 60-525. 40] Compared to low carbon emissions. [525. 40-527. 44] This is based on ISO.

[527. 44-529. 24] 4501 This implementation. [529. 24-530. 78] Occupational Health and Safety Management. [530. 78-531. 80] Here. [531. 80-534. 36] In 2024, it was granted the Department of the Husband's Functions. [534. 36-535. 64] National Security Performance Award. [535. 64-536. 16] SMEs.

[536. 16-537. 44] Special price. [537. 44-537. 48] That's all for us. [539. 48-542. 30] A big affirmation for our group. [542. 30-543. 84] OK next year. [543. 84-545. 88] We are mainly committed to production. [545. 88-547. 16] Reduce the environment.

This product under [547. 16-549. 22]. [549. 22-550. 76] and then again. [550. 76-553. 32] The second part is what we want to do. [553. 32-555. 10] This improvement in the process. [555. 10-556. 64] Introduces this A1. [556. 64-558. 94] and then reduces the equipment.

[558. 94-560. 74] The current living wind is followed. [560. 74-563. 04] The Garfnezmin University did some. [563. 04-54664. 58] Co-operating plan for the record. [56. 58-566. 12] The hope is to improve this. [566. 12-569. 20] Maintaining high-end products for production efficiency. [569. 20-570. 98] Can also be improved.

[570. 98-572. 52] Our most recent three years. [572. 52-574. 56] Expenditure on the weekly ratio. [574. 56-575. 60] Not more than 1%. [575. 60-576. 88] or even 2%. [576. 88-579. 18] So you can see us in 2024. [579. 18-580. 72] The cloud market closes more than 2023.

[580. 72-582. 24] There has been substantial growth. [582. 24-584. 30] That should be spared for great growth. [584. 30-585. 58] The main thing is [585. 58-586. 86] In order to diversify our products. [586. 86-588. 40] To diversify our products. [588. 40-590. 96] And our R&D project.

[590. 96-593. 00] So we also have our green process. [593. 00-596. 08] So we invest heavily in research and development. [596. 12-598. 94] Standby. [598. 94-601. 76] Good. [601. 76-610. 20] I don't know if you have any comrades who want to do this. [610. 20-613. 28] Do you have any other questions?

[613. 28-617. 88] If we do not have any further questions today, we would like to thank the Chief Financial Officer for his explanation. [617. 88-620. 70] Thank you for joining us in our meeting today. [620. 70-622. 48] Thank you for your continued support. [626. 12-627. 14] Thank you all.
