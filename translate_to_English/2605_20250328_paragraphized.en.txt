OK Welcome to the first quarter of 2025. Today, we will introduce the entire performance of the first quarter of last year and the overall operating status of the first quarter. First of all, we have 15 vessels on board, 4 ConsumEx 7 Capsize 1 VOC 3 VOCCs, which is unchanged. As for the fourth quarter, there are NT$1 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, which is lower than the third quarter, the main reason is that the shipping costs of cruises are less, less than 27 days, and the third quarter is less than 27 days.

The total revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was NT$4.4 billion, with more than $200 million higher in 2023, mainly due to the price of the Strait type, Sea-Sum type, and super large iron ore sand ship, which was higher than in 2023. Then the whole surplus was NT$2.56 per share, which was significantly increased compared to last year.

VLC was in 2023, not in 2024. The three VLCCs had a boat in 2024 for 46 days. Compared to the management reports of D4 and D3, we can see that in the D3, the Strait type was less than $14 million in the previous quarter, which was profitable before tax. ConsumEx lost $8 million, ConsumEx lost $8 million, and ConsumEx lost $8 million. DLCC lost $500,000.

This is a picture of the blue in 2024 compared to the year 2023. It is an orange figure in 2023. It can be seen that the performance is much higher than the previous year 2024 is the transmission of CAPSIZE, and then the VLC, and the CASAMU. The VLCC is relatively low compared to 2023, mainly the fourth quarter, so it is also relatively low and lower throughout the year. We can see that CASAMU's daily rent, in the second half of 2024, it is down, uh, uh, uh, uh, down, uh, down, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, the first February of 2025 is also down.

The VLCC also has a slightly lower impact on this level, which is a risk that began in 2023, but this VLCC is a slightly lower one, oh. Another possibility is to report is that the company's cash and debt situation, the company's cash account now has a cash of $9596 billion, where there is a 61 million US dollars, the fixed deposit is a fixed rate of $42%, and the fixed rate of $6.1 billion is a fixed deposit. We have a new Taiwan dollar loan is $11.2 billion, the annual interest rate is 1.9%, the mortgage is $105 million, 6%, and the total mortgage is $12 billion, which is a reference for everyone. Well, let's take a look at the outlook for 2025.

Channel type is mainly coal and iron ore sand, mainly iron ore sand, which 2025 economic growth forecast is mild expansion, so the demand for iron ore sand is still very strong, the ship's supply is relatively small, so the demand to stabilize the ship's supply is relatively small, so the market is relatively optimistic.

In addition, we will report a project update Cement Project update, uh, simply speaking of this project should start to mass production in the fourth quarter of this year, then his production is relatively not high, then most of the production will come out next year or next year, is expected to be 1.21 tons, which of course will affect the entire trade route, such as from the original Australia China iron ore sand, Australia may change to Australia China, for example.

West Africa to China The shipping mileage will increase by about 7000 miles in Yanton Sea. The freight market will then be affected and the demand for iron ore sand ships will increase. So long-term outlook is good, so it can also explain why Chinese shipowners are buying large ships in large quantities of CAPSIZE is the reason for VLC.
