Hello all friends, I am the general manager of Chinachem Technology. Today, on behalf of the company, I would like to present this briefing to you. Today, I will mainly share the development of Chinachem this year.

Future development, concern observation, exchange rate, response, strategy. It is divided into five parts. We will start with the company's development profile. Then bring to Q1's operational performance and development strategy.

Finally, we bring you the overall development of H1 throughout the year. And the new operating outlook. The last time is for you to be first QA. Before we start, I would like to talk to you about all three of our major investment shareholders. Because they are not just investments.

For us, it is also a strategic alliance. We live in the Pacific Ocean. With global manufacturing resources or industry. Or with industrial technology integration. He is our main core backing.

Later, we introduced MTK. MTK helped us with the AIT chip. Communication module. Then there was our edge computing platform. We played with him to the hardware solution for vertical applications. Then we did a deep integration.

Then we introduced Google. We partnered with Google, and he provided us with our cloud platform.

We work with AI applications. We work with his Google Cloud. We do an integration of platform resources. Strengthen the architecture of our current E-SaaS in China. Or our smart program solutions. Integrate the technology of these three shareholders with global resources.

Let's move on to IPC 3.0, which we're now on our way to. Platform with our digital services. They're the backbone of our key. This is our multi-angle business. We're from IPC 1.0 from the beginning. From hardware and software to our public markets.

IPC 2. 0 platform integration. So far IPC 3. 0. We have introduced AIoT ESG cloud subscription architecture. Continue to strengthen our software and hardware integration. And then cloud computing. Over the past five years, we have invested a lot in R&D.

Whether it's embedded design, or cloud platform security AI edge computing, these are the ones we've invested in. That's because we've been investing primarily in core technologies in development over the past five years. So far, there are about 6000 RD engineers around the world. The number of people in our group is about 15800.

This is our Chinese group. He has been in China since 2011 to 2024. Our revenues range from 1.4 billion in 2011 to 1463.8 billion in 2024. Our annual revenues now reach 42%.

There is also a comparison benchmark from 2013 to 2024. The net profit KGAR is 22%. The range is also from 2013 to 2024. At present, we are looking at our revenue this year. The team is still confident.

This is our smart hardware and hardware platform in China. We have just mentioned that there are 6000 engineers around the world. We have a blueprint for our future development. We will focus on AI. We will develop at home and abroad.

Now we want to export the smart program, smart manufacturing, and then integrate ESG.

Finally, we combine our cloud subscriptions with our smart solutions. That's what we're offering now. Our investment strategy is hardware-based. We combine software to add value. And we combine our system integration.

Finally, go to our brand channel. Hardware development. We are just as focused on POST. Kiosk Lottery. Or ATM. Self Checkout.

This game. Smart Retail. Smart Finance. And then extend to. Cyber Security. Edge PC.

Edge Computing. Mobile RPC. Integration with IoT Devices. Some of these integrations. Software design part. Now we focus on automation.

Digitize. Then intelligentize it. Converged with the AI engine.

AI platform. Visual engine. Model generation language engine. Synthesis with video. We plan to land. We will standardize it.

Modular. Make it more platformable. Make it intelligent. Then energy management. Building Twins. Information Security.

Security monitoring. Electronic shopping mall. It can be used in our Smart Park. Or Smart Building. Further implement ESG.

These are the words of the Lord, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom, and they are the words of wisdom.

This series of ESG-related topics. It will be later. Application of data. Combine our information security. And security monitoring. Then on rail transportation.

We can import smart transportation. Smart medical. Smart furniture. Part of this page. Global tariffs. Impact on exchange rates.

Our countermeasures. Regional manufacturing in China. Fully built with sales services. The Group continues to carry out global, localized population buildings. In the industrial chain and sales management. Appropriate contingency.

Tariffs and exchange rates are for our company. Because we take natural avoidance. We try to avoid in the area. Do it to match it in this mode. Although it can be reduced.

Some of our risks are introduced. But in the purchase. It will still be reflected. It is reflected in our. The time limit to redeem the phone above. This will also have an effect.

The day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near.

Short-term calculation is good news. But because of the details, it has not been published yet. It is not very clear to the end. The future will still be for its final agreement. The implementation of the situation.

That is to match our global layout. Evaluate a production and shipping strategy. We are now mainly active in the creation of a dependency. Decentralization is a dependency. So we are now in the process of regional manufacturing.

We are in the United States, Canada, Mexico. That China, Vietnam, Malaysia. Then we have now set up a second headquarters in Singapore. These global layout is. Because of the global political economy. It is changing too fast.

That we believe in such a layout structure. We can be more flexible. Come and serve us in these 73 sales countries.

We review the operating performance of Q1 in 2025. Our operating revenue is 344.7 billion. Annual operating revenue is 17.5 billion. Seasonal is 51.7 billion. YY is 5.38. Q1 is-13. 0%.

That's because it compares to last year's Q4. Q4 is actually a system that we have a relatively strong traditional customer traffic. So QOQ can show a recession. But our revenue should be high in the same period.

The seasonality is 3.600 million. YY is 12.7%. QOQ is -4.6%. The operating economy part is 15.200 million. Annual growth is 5.500 million. Quarterly increase is 1.2 billion.

YY is 57.8 billion. QOQ is 8.6%. Part of the tax economy is 18.8 billion. Annual growth is 5.3 billion. Quarterly increase is 0.2 billion. YY is 39.3%.

QOQ is 0.9%. Net profit attributable to parent company is 8.3 billion. Annual growth is 200 million. Quarterly decrease is -0.8 billion. We YY is 31%. QOQ is -9.2%.

The EPS of our Q1 is 6.02 yuan. It should be a record new high. The annual growth is 1.3 billion yuan. The annual increase is 0.35 yuan. The quarterly decrease is 0.26 yuan.

YY is 28. 9%. QOQ is -9.3%. Our Q1 quarter is three green depth. Based on Q1 results, our gross profit margin is 21.5 percent. Yearly increase is 1. 4 percentage points.

Quarterly increase is 1.9 percentage points. YY is 7. 0%. QOQ is 9. 7%. Operating economy part is 4. 4%. Annual increase is 1. 4 percentage points. YY is 46. 7%.

Quarterly increase is 0.9 percentage points. QOQ is 25. 7%. After-tax economic rate is 5. 4%. Annual growth is 1. 3 percentage points. Quarterly increase is 0.7 7 percentage points. YY is 31. 7%.

QOQ is 14. 9%. It's ours. We're going to be one. We're going to be together for a five-year period. We're going to be together for a five-year period.

In 2025, Q1 was 344.7 billion. The EPS part was from two pieces. To date, Q1 is 6.2 pieces. The KGR part is a high growth of double digits.

The revenue of KGR is 14.3%. But our EPS. Our EPS is 31.7%. Next. Next.

We continue to grow rapidly. Q1 in 2025. ESAS revenue is 4.5 billion. Annually, it is 5.80 billion.

YY is 15%. Pure software program is 2.1 billion. 47%. Soft and hard cake program is 2.4 billion. 53%. We continue to strengthen in AI and ESAS.

This also includes the proportion of revenue from the entire program of hardware and software. This also includes the proportion of revenue from the entire program of hardware and software. So we are now pure software programs. The proportion is almost 50%.

We want to strengthen it now. Our global market size is SARS. Around 1132 B. IoT is 543 B. IPC is 6. 3 B.

This market. We are very strong now. Fight for it. Deeper into it. Huawei continues to optimize our product portfolio. Enhance our profitability.

Q1's operating gross profit is 74 billion. Yearly increase is 8.3. EYY is 12. 7%. If according to the product gross profit range.

The same period last year. IoT. Growth from 12% to now is 13%. That's in IoT plus AI. From 37%. Public design and system integration part from 51%.

The proportion of revenue was reduced to 42%. But we integrated the hardware and hardware of our power-based products. From 1.2 billion to 152 billion. From 37%. The hardware and software subscription service. From 3.9 billion to 4.5 billion.

12% weight. That. AI Hardware AI.

AI. AI. Our outlook for the second half of the year. Our overall operating outlook for the whole year. Should be that there are five of the three major business units in China this year.

Follow the current tariffs. Then the Economic and Political Bureau. Then. Integration part. North American semiconductor is too large. Related.

There will be a lot of orders. Then. Engineering. Brand currency.

We are strong, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are.

[1545. 00-1547. 00] It should be said that we need to reassess the current situation. [1547. 00-1549. 00] As far as I know, there are no special configuration or arrangement. [1549. 00-1551. 00] They are not special configuration, they collect money and pay USD. [1551. 00-1553. 00] Long analysis, we need to understand the needs and budget of the customer. [1553. 00-1555. 00] We are the customers to collect money, the other party is to pay USD.

[1555. 00-1557. 00] The opposite business is to pay US dollars, that is to say, to us, you do not have any special out-of-pocket US dollars. [1557. 00-1559. 00] So, everyone should say to themselves, I should answer you like that. [1559. 00-1561. 00] I should answer you like that, you are not really operating the US dollars. [1561 00-1563. 00] So, we need to re-evaluate the current situation. [1563. 00-1565. 00] Everyone should say to themselves, I should answer you like that. [1565. 00-1567. 00] I should answer you, you do not have no special operation in US dollars.

[1567. 00-1569. 00] In other words, we need to reassess the current situation. [1569. 00-1571. 00] I should answer you, you are not particularly in operation of the dollar. [1571. 00-1573. 00] You are not specific in operation of the dollar, about how much. [1577. 00-1579. 00] How much is the section about which we are currently able to analyze. [1579. 00-1581. 00] We can analyze the data, this is our company. [1581. 00-1581. 00] This is the company of this company.

[1583. 00-1585. 00] This company, that company. [1585. 00-1587. 00] This company, this company. [1587. 00-1589. 00] This company, this company. [1591. 00-1593. 00] This company, this company. [1591. 00-1593. 00] This company. [1593. 00-1595. 00] This company, this company.

[1595. 00-1597. 00] This company, this company. [1597. 00-1599. 00] This company, this company. [1599. 00-1601. 00] This company, this company. [1601. 00-1603. 00] This company, this company. [1605. 00-1605. 00] This company. [1605. 00-1607. 00] This company, this company.

[1607 001-1609. 00] This company. [1609. 00-1611. 00] This company. [1611. 00-1613. 00] This company, this company. [1613. 00-1620. 00] In other words, about the overall weather and data, as well as the mainstream products of talent? [1620. 00-1629. 00] For the second half of the year you just said the proportion of revenue, because it will be related to the product mainstream. [1629. 00-1636. 00] Because in fact the proportion of revenue, one is the exchange rate, the exchange rate doing small or small.

[1636. 00-1641. 00] Because it has changed, your absolute conversion is different. [1641 00-1653. 00] Another thing is that NCR is its client, and its revenue is also linked to NCR. [1653. 00-1658. 00] Because at that time I expected that I would read several units because it was related. [1658. 00-1663. 00] Because at that time N client was expected that Q2 would connect. [1663. 00-1667. 00] That was exactly October when we met Trump's tariff policy. [1667. 00-1669. 00] So we shared a common goal.

[1669. 00-1671. 00] We have a common resolution to start the connection when it is more clear in its tariff policy. [1671. 00-1679. 00] So at the moment we have only reversed backwards, we have to start at the end of Q3. [1679. 00-1685. 00] Because it is not high at the moment, its tariff policy is still high. [1685. 00-1688. 00] The first gun in October it was directly directed towards the development of the manufacturing industry, manufacturing a major town. [1688. 00-1697. 00] Moscow, China, and then Vietnam. [1697. 00-1700. 00] But the first stage is the three parts of the focus on the city.

[1715. 00-1704. 00] So we really can't get a clear solution with our customers right now. [1704. 00-1707. 00] So we just have to push it forward and Q3 as well. [1707. 00-1715. 00] The current situation may be a bit more clear. [1715. 00-1717. 00] So we expect to see the end of Q3 at the end of next year. [171717. 00-1722. 00] It should be easy to start making a comprehensive connection. [1722. 00-1730. 00] So we expect to end of Q3 by the end of next year.

[1730. 00-1734. 00] It should be possible to start with a full-fledged connection. [1742. 00-1745. 00] So there is now a choice of where to ship. [1745. 00-1754. 00] You refer to the manufacture of the product, or the sales department. [1754. 00-1757. 00] The product is now divided into three regions. [1757. 00-1759. 00] The European language is Brapes. [1760. 00-1767. 00] In Asia, there are two areas in Asia.

[1767. 00-1769. 00] There is one in Malaysia, one in Vietnam. [1769. 00-1771. 60] And then there is our Japan, the oil. [1771. 60-1774. 00] That part of the United States is Mexico. [1774. 00-1781. 00] It is Brapes, Asia, Mexico, the comprehensive Tianda West Field. [1781 00-1788. 00] Well, it should be said that there are two. [1788. 00-1793. 00] We will set up a scene there, where the Tianda West Field.

[1793. 00-1798. 00] There is also one in Mexico, that is, two. [1798. 00-1802. 00] It is now more mature in comparison to the big west. [1802. 00-1804. 00] I would not say that there is a shipping cost between Mexico and the big west. [1804. 00-1807. 00] Because for me, the settlement is the same, it will be a little less. [1807 00-1810. 00] The difference is too small, it will be less. [18010. 00-1813. 00] It will also be different. [18010. 00-1813. 00]

[1813. 00-1815. 00] Okay, then it will do five, then I will do. [1815. 00-1816. 00] The current feeling is the same. [1816. 00-1818. 00] The customer does not choose to detect it. [1818. 00-1822. 00] Because it is said in Mexico, it will not be too long for the reincarnation. [1822. 00-1825. 00] So you call it detection, it should be said that this will talk to the customer. [1825. 00-1829. 00]

[1829. 00-1832. 00] Because, as you say, the costs of these things are all new now. [1832. 00-1835. 00] For the guests, they can also understand the current situation. [1835. 00-1838. 00] Therefore, it may be necessary to wait until the end of the hardening. [1838. 00-1843. 00] In the middle of the process, we will communicate directly with the guests. [1843. 00-1847. 00] As you say, these things are all new now. [1847. 00-1848. 00]

[1848. 00-1852. 00] For guests, they can also understand the current situation. [1852. 00-1857. 00] Therefore, they may wait until the end of the hardening. [1857. 00-1861. 00] This intermediate process, we will communicate directly with the customer. [1868. 00-1875. 00] That's me, that 18 billion, if I divide it into three departments. [1875. 00-1876. 00] This, for example. [1876. 00-1877. 00]

[1877. 00-1879. 00] Control how many billions there? [1879. 00-1890. 00] Japan? [1880. 00-1882. 00] This is... because I asked this question because. [1899. 00-1891. 00] You just show a picture of it. [1891. 00-1893. 00] You recently received a budget for comparing traffic and defense.

[1896. 00-1900. 00] Of course, this year's focus is on many European countries. [1900. 00-1902. 00] It has increased a lot of national defense spending. [1902. 00-1906. 00] Then Control was the largest supplier of power supply networks in Europe. [1906. 00-1908. 00] I think that includes the government it needs to be increased. [1908. 00-1910. 00] Because Germany should increase some budget. [1910. 00-1913. 00] That is, the most direct control should be received.

[1913. 00-1918. 00] But I feel like you are the number from the beginning of the year to the present. [1918. 00-1922. 00] But I ask you, theoretically, it should increase. [1922. 00-1923. 00] It should increase. [1923. 00-1924. 00] Yes, if you want... [1924. 00-1927. 00] It means that you circle it to benefit the North American side. [1927. 00-1930. 00] I remember its benefits beyond that construction.

[1930. 00-1934. 00] In theory, there should be some things that you do not want to talk about. [1934. 00-1935. 00] It should be... [1935. 00-1937. 00] This is a relatively old data. [1937. 00-1940. 00] Maybe it will roll up again. [1940. 00-1941. 00] The new Rolling up again. [1941. 00-1941. 00] Because I want to answer you.

[1944. 00-1948. 00] It is the month of April. [1948. 00-1951. 00] The time of the World Health Order should actually be more... [1951. 00-1954. 00] If the World Health Order assembly should feel that this number should be more familiar. [1954. 00-1957. 00] Of course, we are now in mid-June. [1957. 00-1959. 00] The next July. [1959. 00-1960. 00] Because your number is different.

[1960. 00-1964. 00] Yes, so now it's time to get stuck in a letter in Q2. [1964. 00-1965. 00] Yes. [1965. 00-1966. 00] That's now... [1966. 00-1968. 00] You're just that E-SARS vote. [1968. 00-196. 00] I'd like to ask. [1968. 00-196. 00] You're now using the chip in Edge.

[1973. 00-1974. 00] Approximate proportion is... [1974. 00-1976. 00] Because the original Intel X86R. [1976. 00-1978. 00] How much proportion is used is Compendia's most recent architecture. [1978. 00-1982. 00] Then how much is the ratio of you Daiwudong that media department. [1982. 00-1984. 00] He himself also... [1984. 00-1987. 00] Now does not want to develop in this Compendia.

[1987. 00-1990. 00] If you ask Chipset gravity. [1990. 00-1993. 00] I don't think there is a way to answer you. [1993. 00-1994. 00] OK. [1994. 00-1996. 00] That's what I mean, actually, you... [1996. 00-2000. 00] I mean MediaTek, but you don't have the opposite sex rules. [2000. 00-2003. 00] In the future, I have Chipset ...

[2003. 00-2004. 00] No. [2004. 00-2005. 00] Nor is this... [2005. 00-2009. 00] But you see that you are now mainstream or NV. [2009. 00-2011. 00] is like his series of other JES. [2011. 00-2014. 00] Or it is the X86 of the original Intel. [2014. 00-2018. 00] To extend the new variable operation.

[2018. 00-2020. 00] This is a more technical thing. [2020. 00-2022. 00] I might really collect a little bit that will not be... [2022. 00-2023. 00] Let's add a little bit together. [2023. 00-2026. 00] Because the number is always growing. [2026. 00-031. 00] I just want to understand that it was originally in the industrial class. [2031. 00-20235. 00] For example, if I added a GPU, I would add some new AI balloons.

[2035. 00-2038. 00] That is to say, even if this high-computing thing goes in. [2038. 00-2041. 00] The plant we grew up with will be faster. [2041. 00-2042. 00] I just want to know. [2042. 00-2046. 00] That is to say how long this ratio can last. [2046. 00-2049. 00] Okay, let's talk about this part. [2049. 00-2042. 00] Let's get back to his plan. [2049. 00-2042. 00]

[2053. 00-2056. 00] And then lastly, the one that just got the advanced question. [2056. 00-2060. 00] It should be interesting to know how much you should expect from the clubhouse outside the night.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided to see if there is a clear segmentation point. For example, when a topic is converted or someone else is speaking, it may be necessary to segment it based on semantics and logic. Next, I will analyze the corresponding sentences for each timestamp in a sentence to ensure that nothing is missing during the conversion process. For example, the first sentence is "but now because you have some currency of your own", and then "then there are some holdings", both of which may belong to the same paragraph as they are discussing currency holdings.

For example, when referring to a subsidiary holding a currency, it may be necessary to consolidate the relevant sentence into a paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sequence of time is correct. During the process, you may encounter duplicates or similar sentences, such as "he will evaluate your inventory calculation" appear twice, and it is necessary to retain the original without any modification.

In addition, some sentences may contain stuttering or duplication of oralization, such as "Because...". ... "These also need to be retained to maintain the integrity of the original wording. It is also important to note that the format of the timestamp is correct to ensure that the timestamp in the paragraph type verbatim after the conversion corresponds to the content. For example, check if the timestamp is incorrectly assigned to different paragraphs.

At the same time, make sure that there are no additional content or modifications to the original intention, and that it is organized entirely according to the verbatim provided by the user. </think> The following is the paragraph verbatim (completely reserved for all the original sentences, only in semantic and logical reordering paragraphs): --- [2060. 00-2064. 00] But now because you own some currency of your own. [2064. 006-2066. 00] And then there are some control holdings. [2066. 00-2068. 00] This means that these subsidiaries have some currency.

[2068. 00-2070. 00] So it is not good to calculate now. [2070. 00-2072. 00] That is what it is. [2072. 00-2076. 00] He will rate... [2076. 00-2078. 00] He will rate the liquidity of the liquidity he has. [2078. 00-2080. 00] He is.

. I'll give you an example. [2080. 00-2081. 00] He is. . . He will evaluate your inventory calculation.

[2081. 00-2082. 00] He will evaluate your inventory calculation. [2082. 00-2084. 00] He will evaluate the net value of your APR. [2084. 00-2086. 00] But at this point in time. [2086. 00-2088. 00] We have no way to give you a very clear answer. [2088. 00-2090. 00] This is the time I am at. [2090. 00-2092. 00] Assuming that I am in the right position of my AR right now.

[2092. 00-2096. 00] Then my AP was just right. [2096. 00-2098. 00] Turn 60 is finished. [2098. 00-2099. 00] My AP is very low.

[2099. 00-2101. 00] This is how I calculate the net worth of my current AR amount is very high. [2101. 00-2104. 00] This is how I calculate the net worth of my evaluation is very high in the inventory. [2104. 00-2108. 00] So I really.. No.

... It is not said that there is no way to do statistics. [2108. 00-2109. 00] But because... [2109. 00-2110. 00] Because... [2110. 00-2112. 00] It is not said that there is no way to do statistics.

[2112. 00-2114. 00] But because it has always been a flow change. [2114. 00-2116. 00] It is confusing. [2116. 00-2119. 00] It is difficult to have a very specific answer with you at this point. [2119. 00-2121. 00] But we may see the second season. [212121. 00-2125. 00] You will see a number of shocks in the water. [2125. 00-2127. 00] Do you think?

[2127. 00-2129. 00] It should be said that it is currently in statistics. [2129. 00-2134. 00] But I can't quite tell you exactly what progress it will have. [2134. 00-2138. 00] But I feel... [2138. 00-2140. 00] Under this global economy. [2140. 00-2142. 00] Everyone will have 5 thousand four five. [2142. 00-2143. 00] I'm the last one.

[2143. 00-2145. 00] Because I look at the other like you... [2145. 00-2149. 00] It seems like every quarter will get that government subsidies... [2149. 00-2151. 00] and that amount is still large. [2151. 00-2115. 00] Yes, that's not me... [2153. 00-2115. 00] I just want to say that it's something I just mentioned about Congenital.

[2156. 00-2159. 00] How much is that about every year... [2159. 00-2160. 00] Or is it fixed or not. [2160. 00-2161. 00] It is not fixed. [2161. 00-2161. 00] Because it is actually something that is also a little... [2166. 00-2166. 00] Government is more secure. [2166. 00-2116. 00]

[2167. 00-2169. 00] You should keep track of it regularly. [2169. 00-2170. 00] Before Cai General... [2170. 00-2172. 00] Cai General should have mentioned it all. [2172. 00-2175. 00] This rail transit or the things of this government project. [2175. 00-2177. 00] It is the nature of the project. [2177. 00-2170. 00] This is what you need to measure depending on your plan.

[2180. 00-2182. 00] Then there is the current case of its government. [2180. 00-2183. 00] Its condition. [2183. 00-2185. 00] and then do the subsidies. [2185. 00-2188. 00] So it will not have a certain rule. [2188. 00-2190. 00] Or it will have a certain rule. [2190. 00-2193. 00] It can be expected how much money it will cost this year.

[2193. 00-2195. 00] How much can I get this year. [2195. 00-2196. 00] I remember that you also took 50 last year. [2196. 00-2199. 00] Because this will also be the docking schedule for your project. [2199. 00-2201 00] I remember that it will be more and more. [2201. 00-2202. 00] More and more. [2202. 00-2204. 00] Will you be more and more every year.

[2204. 00-2207. 00] I can't even think of that. [2207. 00-2208. 00] [2223. 00-2225. 00] Because of the previous mention of Zhu Dong. [2225. 00-2228. 00] He will target some of the group's mentors. [2228. 00-2231. 00] I don't know what the progress is now.

[2234. 00-2236. 00] is some may disappear. [2236. 00-2237. 00] Because of the diagnosis. [2237. 00-2240. 00] Then some will raise the expected one. [2240. 00-2244. 00] Zhu Dong has often held an allegation. [2244. 00-2246. 00] And then the diagnosis. [2246. 00-2250. 00]

[2250. 00-2254. 00] That's what I think. [2254. 00-2256. 00] Zhu Dong is ongoing. [2258. 00-2261. 00] So there may be a second season of legislation. [2261. 00-2264. 00] Some companies' shareholding structure. [2264. 00-2266. 00] There may be some reverses. [2266. 00-2268. 00] I don't think this is a problem.

[2268. 00-2270. 00] [2270. 00-2270. 00] I don't think that's a problem. [2272. 00-2275. 00] But Cover Strong is not able to increase the shareholding anymore. [2275. 00-2270. 00] This is mentioned before. [2277. 00-2270. 00] Because there is another increase in the shareholding. [2279. 00-2270. 00] I'm going to buy it in full.

[2280. 00-2283. 00] At that time the European bill was. [2283. 00-2286. 00] It should be said. [2286. 00-2287. 00] As long as it is of good quality. [2287. 00-2292. 00] We will all deepen it. [2292. 00-2294. 00] You can ask. [2294. 00-2209. 00] What is the present percentage of software and services?

[2309. 00-2311. 00] [2311. 00-2314. 00] You mean that it is in e-shax. [2314. 00-2316. 00] appears to be tens of thousands. [2316. 00-2317. 00] appears to be tens of thousands. [2317. 00-2319. 00] appears to be eighteen. [2319. 00-2321. 00] appears to be forty-nine thousand.

[2321. 00-2323. 00] This is a persistent income. [2323. 00-2325. 00] This is a persistent income. [2325. 00-2326. 00] Yes. [2326. 00-2328. 00] But. [2328. 00-2332. 00] It has continued to grow. [2332. 00-2332. 00] It has also been deepened.

[2333. 00-2336. 00] But because of its overall proportion. [2336. 00-2339. 00] According to the revenue of our group. [2339. 00-2341. 00] It is relatively small. [2341. 00-2346. 00] It growth rate. [2346. 00-2348. 00] It growth rate. [2348. 00-2354. 00] It is faster than other businesses.

[2354. 00-2356. 00] Because of the return of just that. [2356. 00-2359. 00] Because it is currently small brand. [2359. 00-2362. 00] So the space for progress is not much. [2362. 00-2370. 00] Yes. [2370. 00-2371. 00] It will not have a retail account. [2371. 00-2372. 00] It will not have a retail account. [2371. 00-2372. 00] It will not have a retail account.

[2372. 00-2373. 00] Better line. [2373. 00-2373. 00] There is still a line of development. [2374. 00-2375. 00] There is still a line of development. [2375. 00-2377. 00] It will pass through the condition of the platform. [2377. 00-2380. 00] Compare the platforms. [2380. 00-2382. 00]

[2382. 00-2383. 00] This yuyu. [2383. 00-2385. 00] Then. [2385. 00-2388. 00] Return to the traffic. [2388. 00-2389. 00] Return to the traffic. [2401. 00-2402. 00] So instead of [2402. 00-2403. 00] Any progress.

[2403. 00-2405. 00] Yes. [2405. 00-2406. 00] Yes. [2406. 00-2407. 00] Yes. [2407. 00-2408. 00] The original piece. [2408. 00-2409. 00] Or the other piece. [2409. 00-2410. 00] The first layer.

[2410. 00-2411. 00] Then it becomes. [2411. 00-2412. 00] Change. [2412. 00-2413. 00] Still. [2413. 00-2414. 00] There. [2414]
