Ladies and gentlemen, Senior Investment Media, Mr. Ann, today is Tuesday, March 18, 114. It is now 2:30pm. Kunyun held the operational briefing session for the fourth quarter of 113. I am Mr. Gao Ming, vice president of Finance, today I am here to brief you.

Today is the content of our main presentation. In the fourth quarter, 113 in the fourth quarter. In terms of seasonality, we began to enter the low season. So some relative data was slightly lower than the third quarter. But we were a little lower in 2023.

In contrast to the fourth quarter of the year 112, a good performance can still be seen. First in the revenue segment. Last year, the consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of the year 113 was 227 million.

The other part of the business benefit. There are 96 million, close to 10 million levels. Here is the main. It is a performance of profit in the industry. Compared to last year, compared to the fourth quarter of 112. Because the fourth quarter of 112 is a loss of operations.

That's why it's 191% higher than the same period in 2023. One of the main reasons for this is that revenues have grown by 15.1%. However, the gross profit margin remained close to 1% in the fourth quarter.

In addition, there is a good control of the operating expenses here. It is appropriate to control. So the whole business benefits is a large growth situation. That is in addition to the outside industry. Because there are some stable outside income. Mainly interest income.

There are also contributions to some out-of-the-business gains from the return on investment. So net profit after tax in the fourth quarter. Profits attributable to the parent company's amount. Reached over 20 million levels. Compared to the 112th quarter of 2023, conversion losses have also grown significantly by 509%.

If we look at last year's third quarter of the year, the gross profit margin is 39.2%. The profit margin is 4.3%. The net profit margin is 9.2% after tax. The other EPS in a single quarter is 0. 0%.

In 2024, EPS was 0. 64%. Then we made a note here using the consolidated profit and loss table. That was in the gross profit margin section. The gross profit margin here was 39.2%. That was compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year in 2023.

The cost was just a slight increase of $1 million. So the whole business benefit was close to 10 million levels. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, it was a significant improvement. The other part of the tax before the 25 million. Compared to the same period.

It's 10 times the growth. That's 5 times the growth here after tax. So here are the parts listed in QOQ. The third quarter is probably a slight decline. But the year can be seen. The gross profit growth is 30.

Gross profit increased 32.8% year-on-year. Better than revenue. Plus, before and after sales tax. All of them have a helping growth. That's based on last year's year-on-year 2024 performance.

Revenue was 9.7 billion. That year, it increased by 27% year-on-year. That was part of gross profit of 3.9% year-on-year. That part of 2024 was 39 billion.

Gross profit margin has reached more than 40%. Gross profit margin has also grown by 35.7. The cost is a slight increase of 12.8. Therefore, the profit margin of the industry.

That's 10 times the increase. That's before tax. Net profit and net profit after tax year-on-year. Both have grown by more than 90%. That's if we use time. A time series of quarters to see.

In fact, you can see. Last year was a quarter of a season. The second quarter and third quarter were a seasonal peak of operations. The fourth quarter was a slight decline. But you can see last year's year-round. The scale of the total revenue was year-on-year compared to 2023.

The growth has grown by 27%. The growth has increased by an extremely high one. In the Maori part. The overall gross profit margin is a manifestation. It has also been in the last four years. Especially throughout the last year.

Gross profit margins are stable throughout the four seasons. Gross profit margins reached 40.3 throughout the year. So you can see us. The combined gross profit margin ranges from 25% in 2021 to 28% in 2022.

Percentage. Gross margin is a gradual increase in the year to year. Because gross margin is gradually increasing. Plus the control of the fees. So last year four quarters showed a profitable situation.

The other part of the liquidity. The balance ratio is only 13.6%.

It is also a good performance. It is also a sufficient amount of cash. That is, if we look at it with several indicators. This is a change in the last four years. The whole of the consolidated report above.

Reduced from 17.8 in 2021 to 13.6%.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I read the entire transcription fragment to understand the general structure of the content. It looks like this section mainly discusses the company's financial performance, product line, market distribution, and strategy. Next, I need to reorganize the transcription of the original timestamp into a coherent paragraph while keeping each sentence as it is. Next, I will check it every time to make sure that no sentence is missing.

I will then identify the subject of each paragraph and classify the relevant sentences. For example, some of the financial indicators may include flow ratios, operating cycles, inventory turnovers, etc. These can form a paragraph. The product line portion involves input devices, image products, sound output, etc., and can be divided into another paragraph. Market distribution and customer strategy may require separate paragraphs.

At the same time, pay attention to the correct use of punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, to ensure that the paragraph structure is clear. It is also necessary to check for duplicate or redundant content, but according to user requirements, no sentences can be deleted, so even if there are duplicates, it must be retained. For example, the section about regional sales distribution may be mentioned multiple times in different paragraphs, and all reservations are required.

The rest of the operating cycle, the increase in recovery days remained in about 33 days to 34 days. The other part of the inventory week rate, as the stock gradually decreases, our weekly stock depreciation part, also from 2021 108 days to the end of the year is a level of 90 days. The profitability part of the three indicators, the first is the asset rate RA, is a gradual increase, and the return on shareholders' equity is a gradual increase.

In the past year, about 37.7 parts of Asia, which accounted for about 43% of the total sales volume in Europe, 22% in Latin America, 28.9% in the Middle East, and 6,1 percentage points in the Middle East, this is a situation in the fourth quarter. In the last year, about 37.7 parts of Asia, which accounted for about 37% in Latin America, about 34.5 in Europe, about 20% in Europe. The core technology here, mainly in the input device, is a technology, so we launched the product with the input device-based keyboard, as well as the digital version of the device.

First of all, in the first part of the mouse, last year and this year we focus on the four spindles, the first is the ergonomic mouse, where the entire user, the use of very frequent health, but also has the concept of ESG, human health, user health, so we launched the ergonomic mouse. In addition, in the wireless part, we have a double-mode mouse, BT plus 2. 4G technology, and the silent mouse, as well as the environmentally friendly Rechargeable mouse.

This is why we have also introduced a peripheral accessories related to Type-C, and then a remote control and a number of accessories for some computers. In terms of product comparison, we just introduced a lot of products, now in the fourth quarter, our mice accounted for about 20% of revenue contribution, the keyboard is about 20% of the total revenue contribution, the other two, mainly in the image, mainly two, one is the driving recorder, accounting for 40%, and then the other video image network camera, about four percent. At the same time in the audio output, mainly have headphones and speakers, adding about six percent points, while just mentioning Bluetooth-related peripherals, there are about six percent points, that is the fourth quarter of the year.

In addition, last year, we focused on developing new customers in two regions, including Latin America, Costa Rica Chile Argentina and Mexico, which is part of the Asia Pacific region, mainly in Vietnam Philippines in Southeast Asia, as well as Sri Lanka South Asia Sri Lanka in the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East with Israel, the development of these guests, because he has a return order, in other words, has been down to two to three orders in the last year.

[1016. 00-1018. 00] Not only the first four singles, we see that the number of customers will also increase to our entire customer portfolio this year, bringing us revenue contribution. [1026. 00-1028. 00] In the strategic product section, the main focus is on these six mains, just ahead of us, such as the promotion of Hua mouse, ergonomic mouse, gaming peripherals, bluetooth headsets, other accessories related products, and AI peripheral input device products. [1049. 00-1054. 0054] We have compiled six points for this year's business aspect. [1056. 00-1059. 00] The first one is the upgrade and application trend of AI products, and we know that there are now the ASIC ICs, and more cheaper AI training models, which will increase the breadth and depth of the overall use of AI applications. [1079. 0081. 0081. 0081.] Microsoft will also upgrade Windows 11th October and Windows 11th October.

[1092. 00-1095. 00] The second aspect of the business is Trump's policy, which deals with tariff trade wars and the U.S. trilateral federal expenditures. This part of the attitude of the guests here also affects their attitudes a little bit, that of the United States, which is a factor in the overall environment, the conflict of geopolitical and war, especially in Ukraine, and the Middle East. [1125. 00-1128. 00] A mindset of our local customers, and that of our products that need to be transported through the sea or sea, is a conflict that affects the length of the entire transport, then the cost of the transportation. [1149. 00-1152. 00] The central and southern parts of South America, such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and these countries continue to grow. [1170. 001-1174] The strength of the importation and continuity of their import recovery and continuity, which is an important part of our revenue, which is an important part of our revenue, and a major impact of our revenue of our revenues, and a major factor.

[1190. 00-1194. 00] So these six factors are what we've come across this year as an issue of operational power, so we'll continue to focus on, there's certainly some uncertainty and challenges here. [1200. 00-1204. 00] It'll be a key issue for our operations, and above is our report on the results of operations of the first century. [1210. 00-1213. 00] Next is the Q&A, please have no problems with the advanced, and if not, we'll finish the spell today. Thank you for your participation.
