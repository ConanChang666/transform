We are very pleased to announce that we have a meeting today with Mr. Zhang Jingrong, Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Tainan Stock Exchange. The meeting will be divided into two parts, namely, Mr. Wu Luolan, Deputy Director-General of Mr. Lin Zhiwei, and Mr. Li Shu-yan, Deputy Director-General of Vice-President of the Board of Directors.

Thank you all for investing in advanced afternoon ann. That's first of all a look at my company's main products, operations, and finances. We'll start planning these four parts with you and make a brief report and then carry out the Q&A. The Tainan textile was founded in 1955, and this year marks the 70th anniversary of our founding. Our paid-back capital is 165 billion, and Mr. Hu Boming was listed in 1989.

This section also corresponds to the value of our manufacturing capital. This section also corresponds to the value of our manufacturing capital. The two major projects include two business groups. One is a spinning business group, one is a chemical fiber business group, and the other is a business group.

For example, for a factory or for sale. Our company is located in the middle of the textile industry chain. The main raw material of the spinning group is natural cotton. So we have from major supply areas around the world. So we have from major supply areas around the world.

The main raw material of the chemical fiber group is PTAEG. This part we buy in the domestic market. Our sales target is the downstream weaving of the whole production. Our operations are located in addition to Tainan headquarter and Taipei office. The chemical fiber group that just mentioned is mainly the production base in Tainan, Taiwan. There are chemical fiber plants and the Pacific factory.

There are chemical fiber plants and Pacific plants. There are chemical fiber plants and Pacific plants. The production base of chemical fiber group is in the Tongnai province of Vietnam. There are two subsidiaries of South Vietnam imitating Vietnam and Prince Edward Long. The main products of the spinning group are cotton yarn mixing yarn OE yarn and a variety of functional yarns.

The monthly capacity of all the major products. Please invest in advanced reporting. It is generally the same as the previous year. But it is also as you all invest in the supply of high information. Because the world's polyester capacity is too heavy. Then the demand is also relatively low.

On the whole. In August last year, the board of directors of our company passed resolution. Then we will just mention the main production products of the chemical fiber plant. It is polyester cotton. Although we still retain the monthly production capacity of 9900 tons. But the production capacity of the fat part.

We stop production for a while. So the actual production will be reduced to 900 tonnes per month. That's another part of the imitation texture. That's the main selling stock right now. Then you see 2024 main products. Just follow the report and explain.

If you want to have a new product. Compared to the previous year, polyester cotton can be found with the above reasons. The production of polyester cotton can be found with the imitation texture. There is a significant decrease compared to last year. That 2024 revenue ratio.

Part of the imitated sand group is 38 percentages. The chemical fiber group is 40 percentages. The other 22 percentages are mainly the imitated shopping center. With us in Vietnam another transfer investment company. Revenue contribution of imitated sand group. That is the distribution of the sales market.

The main market for sand imitation groups is export to Asia. The main market for chemical fiber groups is the domestic market in Taiwan. And part of export to Asia.

The other section of the financial overview. You can see it all. The consolidated profit and loss statement of the single season. Our gross profit and profit margin. Gross profit and profit margin of 2024Q4. Gross profit and profit margin of the business line.

Net operating interest rates. Even magnified throughout the year. 2024 throughout the year. Actually, we are in the chemical fiber and imitated sand industry. The overall environment is on top of the company's manufacturing industry. It is still quite difficult.

This resulted in a loss of net operating profit. That 2024 year-round. Net loss of owners of the parent company's tax is $5.58 billion. The conversion of EPS is a negative $0.34. That ended at the end of 2024. The combined assets of the entire group.

There are about 489 billion. That shareholder interest includes non-company interests. There are about 29,4 billion. If converted into net worth per share, it is likely that it is $17.6. Then the next part of the cash flow table.

Please invest in advance to participate in the review. At the end of 2023, because there are shares of assets. The ratio of income contribution outside of business. Therefore, there is also a relatively high water level in cash at the end of the year. That is basically in 2024. We have continued to use to repay borrowings.

Reducing interest expenses also moderately reduces the water level of cash. Finally, the outlook for the future. We still maintain the same six directions in the medium and long term. First, the continuous optimization and refinement of the textile industry.

The second is to accelerate the development and upgrading of line products. In fact, in the last two years 112 to 13 years. We have also invested nearly 400 million dollars in production line transformation and upgrading. The third is to continue to support the transformation of investment business.

The fourth is the circulation business. Nanfang Shopping Center has reached the tenth anniversary of its opening. The turnover in 2024 is also over 10,5 billion years old. The fifth point is to continue to revitalize the assets. It includes the rental of idle factories for sale.

And planning the development of the Nanfang Science and Technology Park. That last point continues to be the central point of our business expansion. This is my presentation. If you have any questions, please leave a message below. Then talk to our colleagues.

Thank you. Check out the comparison between 2023 and 2024 gross profit. A big change. That's a little difference in gross profit. For 23 and 24 years.

In fact, in terms of the overall situation. Mainly or 24 years. Our manufacturing industry mimics the part. Affected by the industrial environment. So this part is indeed in Maori. Because of the brand part.

It has some de-escalation of stock. In fact, it does strictly control. So the unit price of the whole sale is above. It is also more difficult. Therefore, the gross profit margin is indeed affected. There are some effects in the manufacturing industry.

This is part of the problem, but we also have a problem, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

對,對,對。 剛才gra possa,谢谢,谢谢,好,感谢,chcia,化,叫,那么,那么,那么,我们,我们,我們的訪問,當然,其实,好轉移 謝謝。 製造本業的傳統的訂單能見譜,或者是客戶可以訪問的事,大概是如何的選擇,這可能要分仿砂跟華研,還是我們麻煩仿砂的業務同事,我針對砂廠的部分做說明,基本上砂廠現在目前生產基地都在越南,台灣這邊是沒有的,我目前的,當然這個產業每一鏈的狀況不一樣,像布廠大概是3到6個月,成衣廠可能長到一年,我們砂廠的話平均大概會1到2個月,不敢看整個市場對後市的判斷狀況,我目前我們業務這邊的狀況,針對第二季的部分的訂單,大概到4月的訂單是已經滿載,目前那個客人在談的大概是5月份的部分,所以,以我手上目前掌握的訂單的SP來看的話,應該是有比第一季的平均出貨單價會好一些些,那主要是兩個原因,第一個是年前這邊同業這邊針對年前想要換現金,所以會在價格上面比較多一些談起,那回過到過年之後大家對於整個市場的價格就會比較有所堅持,再加上說目前棉花企業我不充下棉花企業的部分,大概今年第一季的棉花企業平均每棒大概是在65到68每分,在一個很狹窄的區間盤整,目前看起來65每分是一個比較強的支撐,那主要也是因為棉花補貼政策的關係,不過整個需求其實還是蠻保守的,那最主要還是因為棉花管稅的影響,因為我們自己本身大概每系客戶在我們的比重應該有超過幾成,剩餘的兩到三成會是比較像local跟O系的客戶,那我覺得在進一步明朗之前現在目前品牌下單的狀況都是相對性保守,大多是下到第二季,然而訂單的量雖然focus沒有很大的變化,但是就算他們覺得他們這一季的他們整年度的focus可以接受,他們也不願意再把訂單太多釋放出來,那下游的一貫廠或者是部廠這邊接單的狀況表現不一,就是如果是大型的一貫廠就是他有支付然整到成也或者是他是跟品牌連結比較強的部廠的話他在接單的能力上比較好,一貫能力也比較好,不過整體的需求在越南當地並沒有非常的好,也就是說訂單沒有好到可以外溢到整個供應鏈的每一個人的魚路軍山,所以這第二季的狀況是如此,那我們在看就是雖然第二季是像蘇協說是比較傳統的旺季,但是還是受到美國這邊的影響,所以我們看因為我覺得步調跟下單的節奏上面來講都會比較保守,那後面的影響會變得等到明朗之後力探都變短了,所以變得更大家的他在看上面有比較大的調整性的他會比較容易接到後面正的部分,那中小型相對性就比較辛苦,這邊以上就是我。 那各位親愛的大家好,我針對化纖本業說個補充報告,因為化纖本業的部分在過去的話年輕度大概客人都用抑制方式來下單,因為他們的下游客戶都會有量一些抑制的訊息,基本上從疫情到現在為止這個模式已經打破了,基本上客戶不會再提供訊息給我們,那麼只能當月接當月出訂單模式也都比較大一點,因為他們以前可能有一個多吞分隔然後出廠期,那現在變成少量多樣化的狀況變得會比較明顯,那目前來看的話我們接單大概基本上的加工都在80公左右,那已經維持了幾個月,那目前看起來未來幾個月大概會是相同的加工維持下去。 那旁邊六大方向是未來的重點嗎,是,那些優遜優遜的順序沒有優先重點會放在先,那像這個新加坡維中心的南向政策這個東西比較具體的想出來是全是一個構想,我想整個南方來講本業部分但是本業是一個根本,那根本本業最近這幾年的確不是太好,那受到大陸一個價格競爭的一個影響,我想全球石化業都有影響想到了包括包括來說都已經比較的嚴重了,那是那種初步意料之外的,那這是一個比較難去扭轉的實際,那我們來講到是本業部分還是繼續優化既然是說能夠把這段時間撐過去那看能不能在適當的機會過半載上來我們再抓住機會再開始我們沒有放棄本業部分還是繼續在做一個優化,那至於其他的往那個前面總投資部分這是以前歷史留下來的,是我們的根本,我們南地發公司一樣南地發公司那年問題也是一樣,那它還好它算是還算穩定,那從以前的因為疫情嘛那現在講的就是疫情過了相對它獲利就整個大幅下來了,它還是維持在一個水平,它的那轉投資南美特倒是不錯,南美特是台積電的,它是一個台積電供應商算不出汽油的一個就是這層的汽油的對,那聽起來它東西還不錯,因為有分兩種,一種是被洗掉的,一種是會黏在裡面的,它是屬於會留在裡面的那一種,所以一般價值會比較高一些,那當然他們都好在這算它轉投資也算還不錯的一個國家公司,流通一直是我們10年了,那現在是還在往上走今年疫情應該可以做到我們希望做到110,就是說它還持續還算是穩定成長,可是我們另外一個這10年除了本業以外還算琢磨蠻深的一個部分,那加上這土地是我們自己的,所以我想在上面的發展跟對資產一個資產的活化跟資產的一個價值提升都有很大的幫助,這是我想以資產價值提升這塊是比較有顯著的,但我們沒有去賣它不會去賣它,它後面有一塊1740萬塊。

The residential area can be built. But we don't know how to move it. Those years should still be in the mall's integrity. It's now in the second phase. We've probably covered the three-tiered one in five years. The whole mall is complete.

That's a 5000-year period behind. I believe I'll follow the integrity of the previous one. The value of the backward will be increased again. This part is probably like that. As for that southward, it's always been.

Because we are in Vietnam, we are a long way to the south. 25 years. 25 years. 25 years.

In fact, the South has been going to us for 25 years. It has always been good. It has always been good. We have not been to China directly to Vietnam. That is, of course, we are all affected.

That is Singapore. We will practice in Singapore. But I would like to say, if there is any way to transfer investment opportunities, in Indonesia, I would like to talk about it again.

It will be an investment point from Singapore. Put it from there and then strengthen Vietnam. There will be other Indonesia as well. Other opportunities. We will develop from that Vietnam. But that part.

As soon as the whole of the change of the large aircraft. Now there is a serious talk. But it is not mature yet. That is, the nationalization part of the asset is. I think it will be in the next few years. That should be three to five years.

It is easy to see a little bit of success. We still have that. We have one. It is an industrial plant. It is a project of Taiyuan Science Park. It will start to work this November.

This is an industrial plant. It should be very similar to Taiyuan Science and Technology Park. It should be the same as an industrial plant in the electronics industry. Do a high-convergence industrial plant. This product is not in Tainan.

And we will go to the land of the living, the land of the dead, the land of the living, and the land of the living, and the land of the living, and the land of the living, and the land of the living.

No. That part is the Thamud, now the Thamud, now the Zamou prefecture. That is, there is a piece behind it that is not known why.

He is the one who says, "We have sinned, we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong; we have done wrong.

That development may be a long time. Because the yuan has been doing for 20 years. It's probably almost done. It took 20 years to complete. It's all developed. That's what I believe we're going to do.

It should be a little longer than it could be, and we're bigger than it is, so we're going to take that step one step further, and that's what we're talking about in the South China Sea.

Speaking of the future boss. Apart from this profession. There is another one other than the middle class. Compare the results. A plan. That will start to work in November.

This year, it's also the month of October. That's the way it is now. For this year's follow-up capital expenditure, there will be some comparisons of animations.

Of course, there are some capital expenditures, that should be, and it shouldn't be too much of a problem, after all, our entire debt.

Because it was sold last year. Sold it. The mall of the unified international building. It was the original Hsin-Yi product. The one we owned. 19% was close to 20%.

He is not the only one who has the right to be worshipped, but he is not the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, the only one who has the right to be worshipped, and the only one who has the right to be worshipped.

And he said unto them, Behold, we have sinned, and we have sinned, and we have borne the burden of another; and we have borne the burden of another, and have borne the burden of another, and have borne the burden of another.

The whole is sold to the unity. So the unity now basically holds almost 100%. Because it is there. Doing it now is part of building. The others are almost following their own. Let it be more able to develop.

He is not afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things; he is afraid of all things.

So we learned to say, "It's a piece that tells us about the integrity of the asset, and it's not quite complete, so it's deleted last year, so there's one last year.

There is a reward for the righteous, and there is a reward for the wicked, and there is no reward for the righteous, and there is no reward for the righteous.

I think we're going to do this. That's where the tech plant is. Here's where the capital comes from. That's where we're going to work. That's where the whole debt goes.

It will be higher than last year or two years ago. But first, we fell. Because of last year's cash relationship, it will be slightly higher. But it won't be as high as last year.

That's what I'm going to say. I'm also going to add it here. It's just that you've seen our investment friends. In fact, we have a certain cash level. That's what we're talking about.

If we look at our debt ratio, whether we are individuals or a consolidated balance sheet, our debt ratio is in fact maintained around 30% to 40%. I think it should be considered a conservative financial structure.

We are talking about the development of the Nangang Science and Technology Park. It is also about the development of the Taiyuan Science and Technology Park.

That's basically it. Because we really have people learning, so we're talking about science and technology parks. It's an existing plant. There should be an industrial land of 14 square meters. That's basically where we're headed.

The development mode of Taiyuan Science and Technology Park is the development of a phased segment. The low-stage base area and the volume of the segmentation will be different, so I think the capital expenditure of the national road should be within the scope of our control. If we look at 14 square meters, that odd number is the reaction of the market. At present, we do not have a very clear phased segmentation.

If that is the case, because we just mentioned by the spokesperson, the opportunity to start working at the end of the year or when Happy Moon is expected to take more than two years. So I want to complete the deadline, should it be between the fourth quarter of 2027 and the first quarter of 2028. Then do some of the rental and partial sale. At this stage, we have continued to do the imitation and the bidding, which is to look for potential tenants or buyers first.

The current building is planned, and if we are currently starting the building, we can plan the four phases. It is likely to cover two or three buildings, and its four phases are now covered by the first stage, and the first phase will be two and the second phase will be two. The whole addition is serious, and it will be divided into two to three phases of development. Because now part of the land or the chemical rope plant, it may be moved to the second stage, I believe that fast, it should be moved to the second part in ten years.

I am not sure if he was going to be involved in the design of the building, he actually talked about it before, so he always wanted to go to the south and he needed to be stable in the north, so he did what he was doing would be different from the people. This mall really has a strong ability to say that if I had the ability to do something in Taiwan, this team should be his first team. For him, I thought it was interesting to say that we were at the mall, not at the landmark, so basically I thought that the concept was different from the general mall.

If you are looking for a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place.

It is Ode's mentality Tainan's competition is more beautiful, I'm really serious about the new crown or the strong new crown is inside the strongest now if we say that I don't have gold cakes he has gold cakes if we say that leaving gold cakes, we should not protect the power of higher than he probably said that 180 170170181 about the 81 or gold cake.

The market and others. The market and others said, "270 left gold cookies" is their goal. Like "ener nerd," they do what they want to do "to see one of the things that can be done." The most important thing is that "he shopholders start to put up space."

It is easy to do this kind of movement if it is possible. If it is like we are buying a currency to buy it, it is basically not a pity. Because that cost-effectiveness is not at all. So the price is too high. The road to your government is a good one, for example.

It's not a matter of course to say the whole thing. At the moment, it's more conservative, and the manual work was originally a little related to the investment. So seriously, we want to do fine things, so it may be opened by 2030. For now, it's in 3 years. But I think it's supposed to be finished, but you didn't see any progress this year. So if you want to start again this year, I'm probably the fastest way to open up.

So what to do in the next few years is basically what to do with the combination of products inside that can be done very low. So basically what to do in the next few years we have a lot of ideas before some architecture, but later it slowly went to another direction to want to say to do the hotel, or simply to do a more sophisticated boutique like North Weda. Now is still thinking about it, so let's make it all the pace and replace it, because the Rendezvous area of science and technology park is moving to do it first today, after you see what you want to do again, so the third phase is not necessarily a department store it, but it may be the hotel, maybe it is part of the office, or even think that the office can live with the hotel. Because it can be covered up to the 28th floor, of course, this is the cost of course.

So, I think South China has recently been looking for another possibility that we have been looking for the whole industry a bit slower, then the center in the past recovery is actually the recovery of the department store is not so so strong that it is easier to see the results should be the science and technology distance is 28 years later we are more certain that the situation will be better when we will be 28 years together with one of our original land costs are more serious than the time, so the investment effect will be very large. That is a balance I want to put on a portfolio like our industry pressure on our department store, we can only develop some of the other changes I think is a product mix, and some good thing is that we want to get a little bit closer to the change.
