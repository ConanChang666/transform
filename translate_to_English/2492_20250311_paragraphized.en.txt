The second is our Chief Financial Officer, Ip Chak-kwong, who is also the Director of our Product Marketing Division. The current meeting is handed over to the General Manager here. The time is now handed over to the General Manager.

I briefly introduce Huaxin technology. Huaxin technology is located in 1997 and is now listed in 2001. It is now listed in 2001. Revenue in 2024 is 347 billion. As of February, total revenue is $5.6 billion. The main revenue is based on the shipping location.

The shipping location is currently about 51% in mainland China. Taiwan and Southeast Asia account for about 40%. Then the rest is probably in the United States and Europe. So most of the revenue is now 20%. We are using the production system. Many of our customers are shooting in China.

This is a general overview of the entire business. This is a basic overview of the passive components produced by Waco. You can see that Waco mainly produces electrical, magnetic, semiconductive materials, color RF materials and piezoelectric materials.

There is also the part of carbon electric and light ripples. That about magnetic materials is probably a cable, and there are some filters. The filter is from the color filter to the magnetic, simple is the baseband filter to the power, low frequency filter.

Another RF is probably the color filter and antenna, which is the product above. The piezoelectric word is usually to do some piezoelectric transformers. There are also some tactile, some dark, this kind of stuff. It is mainly focused on the company that mainly focuses on Chinatrust technology. Companies such as KAMAYA, Shun-Chung, Canada, Bi-Song, Nitsuko, Nitsuko, and Jiuying Matsuo. These companies are Japanese companies.

That's why our products are mainly concentrated in MLCC, which accounts for about 50%. 42%. Resistance accounts for about 22%. RF color includes about 17% of antennas.

Another safety regulation product accounts for about 11%. Inductors and other components account for about 11%. The main application areas are automotive, industrial, then PC peripherals, communication with the Internet, consumer batteries, and other parts of medical care, so the main revenue comes from the grid.

Last year's growth was about 6.5%. Growth was about 6.15%. Growth was about 50%.

Revenue grew by 6% to $347 billion. This is the condition of our entire revenue. That is the share of Huaxin's products. The share of market share. The chip resistor Huaxin's market share is about 29%.

This data comes from the Fuji farm. Capacitance accounts for about 10%. It is about the 4th and 5th of the world. It is about the same proportion as OG in our industry.

The LTC ceramic filter is probably about 23% of the world since spring. It is mainly in some areas of mobile phone and network communication. The security capacitance is probably some disk. Because the security capacitance it produces more manufacturers. Now the world's first capacitance is also the spring, so we are probably the second largest in the world.

So we mainly use some of the safety regulations in some of the power classes, and the power coming in and out of AC power. That part of the safety power is probably the part of the market share of our products. This is the difference between the various industries of our products. Our company's products are generally more average in the entire industry, and there is no particular focus on the communication and then the industry.

It is important to note that some new applications, such as new energy vehicles, or smart cars, are probably the most important part of growth. Then, the consumption battery is likely to receive some new products, such as AI applications or some sensors applications, and some manufacturers. Industrial and peripherals are probably a bit flat compared to last year, so this product has just been mentioned before.

This is our place of production. The delivery location and the location of the production and the factory. I am more concerned here is that we have a total of four production bases about one of the four countries is probably the four regions of China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Japan.

So, of course, Taiwan is a big part of our overall revenue. However, there are some production lines that start moving more from Malaysia. But there are some special products that we still have to do there. Because some of its production techniques in Japan have some concept of production that is more suitable for some special goods and some special applications above.

So we're dispersing at least two production locations in all of our products now. Like capacitors, we have two production locations now.

Resistance has three production sites, time-consuming breakdown and two or more production sites, and it uses this way to disperse all the risks. This page is probably a complement to the previous page, that is, of course, multiple production sites, multiple raw materials, the main expansion of production is in Japan and Malaysia. Logistics we are the world's logistics start to add, these personal wayhouses, the other is their own materials, we ourselves have a lot of investment related things. Like just a lot of people care about the company's birth, the material, whether it is sugar content, electrical high, this part is also the main part of our own expenditure.

In addition to the so-called saving parts, there are some detection resistors, so this part of this part is probably the new technology that we can use. The two industries look at here, especially in industrial mines and power above, because we have recently in some power classes, such as Taiwan, because the server industry has grown rapidly, so mainly these high-regulatory capacitors, or even high-voltage, some high-frequency capacitors, which belong to high-voltage capacitors, high-frequency capacitors, are in this industry.

At present, we can see that the PC here is of course in flat, where we can play the original, probably some high tolerance, some of the traditional high-capacity components, some of the resistance resistance to flow, on the server to use. There are some resistors that detect some current size. The communication with consumer, which is also a very important part of our company, the main part is that we now have a filter that involves RF frequency, and then there is an antenna, there is also a so-called color frequency circuit, this high-frequency part, the communication part.

In addition to some of the high-capacity capacitors, some of the high-precision resistors, and even some special low-power resistors that detect power usage, there are some filter parts. So this part has been increased, in addition to some high voltage, special resistors, some sensor parts, here also increased part of the color frequency of the element with the antenna. This is the industry, I think that 5G communication because the situation in the previous year is relatively late, late, this year should have been to Guoping to start slowly up. The consumer electronics because received some effects of AI, so consumer electronics there are still some applications in the growth.

Another is the demand for components, the application of power supplies is more diverse, and the other information processing, because the volume utilization is maximized, so many new cloud components have some new requirements. In this next page, I will make a few simple explanations. The other data center, because some energy efficiency and heat dissipation requirements, so some high-power high currents, the demand between the cloud will continue to increase. Our entire development strategy, of course, to the advanced product development, in the field of AI server application, with the public control of automotive medical and new energy.

In addition, customization, because a lot of things are very special, there are some new products, which we have not been able to contact some semiconductor manufacturers before, or some more advanced industry, because some of the progress of Taiwan's IC, with some industry progress, also help us to bring in, can directly contact these customers directly. So, at the moment, some of the customization things are also starting to be discussed, so this also need to do some relatively quick customization.

In addition, it is a cost reduction, of course, the part of IT automation, flexible manufacturing, business production, overseas expansion and sustainable development. This is actually to de-globalize, and there are some tariff trade issues, we continue to expand these businesses. Sustainability is an orderly topic, and we continue to develop these things.

[1057. 66-1059. 66] OK Next. [1063. 66-1066. 66] The whole industry trend is probably ours. [1066. 66-1069. 66] The general view is about automation. [1069. 66-1070. 66] And so on. [1074. 66-1078. 66] Automation, linearization and green energy and material reduction. [1078. 66-1080. 66] This part begins.

[1080. 66-1083. 66] This is the whole industry we think. [1083. 66-1085. 66] and the trend of technology. [1085. 66-1090. 66] We are looking for various industries in these trends. [1090. 66-1094. 66] In the AI, 5G, in the auto, in the IC industry. [1094. 66-1095. 66] spare hardware. [1095. 66-1098. 66] There is also the application of new energy industry infrastructure.

[1098. 66-1110. 66] I would like to give you some examples. [1110. 66-1106. 66] I would like to reduce the application of this part of the IC industry. [1106. 66-1109. 66] This one you know in the old body package. [1109. 66-1112. 66] In fact, the smaller the component is. [1112. 66-1115. 66] There are even new applications. [1115. 66-1117. 66] It is actually enclosed in the IC.

[1117. 66-1121. 66] The structure that you seal in the IC is yours. [1121. 66-1124. 66] All of your designs are traditional. [1124. 66-1127. 66] Weld it on the PCB board is different. [1127. 66-1129. 66] This is what we actually come into contact with. [1129. 66-1131. 66] I just said we did a lot of custom work. [1131. 66-1132. 66] We started in contact.

[1132. 66-1135. 66] When you come into contact with these more advanced companies. [1135. 66-1139. 66] You will find that we may not have had the opportunity to come into contact with this industry before. [1139. 66-1141. 66] Slowly began to take us into this industry. [1141. 66-1144. 66] You will find that what it requires is really different. [1144. 66-1148. 66] Because it is enclosed in the configuration of this IC. [1148. 66-1150. 66] Some of the needs it needs.

[1150. 66-1153. 66] The environment requirements are also different. [1153. 66-1155. 66] So it does not need something else. [1155. 66-1157. 66] But it does need something else. [1157. 66-1159. 66] For example, it requires a small size. [1159. 66-1162. 66] It does not require SMT punching. [1162. 66-1164. 66] It requires Wafer Bumping.

[1164. 66-1165. 66] These things. [1165. 66-1170. 66] So how do we meet the needs of these industries. [1170. 66-1175. 66] Then reduce these materials. [1172. 66-1175. 66] Contains the reduction of packaging materials. [1175. 66-1175. 66] Previously we used Tapping Tree. [1177. 66-1170. 66] We only made one component.

[1180. 66-1182. 66] Do not need this Tapping Tree. [1182. 66-1183. 66] to meet the needs of semiconductors. [1183. 66-1186. 66] This is some of our new developments. [1186. 66-1190. 66] Another development like this part of AI. [1190. 66-1192. 66] When you come into contact with it. [1192. 66-1195. 66] It will require some comparisons.

[1195. 66-1207. 66] For example, everyone is now in Taiwan. [1197. 66-1202. 66] To put it in the liquid as a flash. [1202. 66-1204. 66] You will find. [1204. 66-1207. 66] You will find that this environment itself is insulated. [1207. 66-1210. 66] So it is designed for a lot of components. [1210. 66-1212. 66] The point of consideration is very different.

[1212. 66-1214. 66] So if you use a different way to design it. [1214. 66-1217. 66] It will get a different volume of computer tickets. [1217. 66-1222. 66] or a different amount of power resistance requirements. [1222. 66-1226. 66] These are all our current needs. [1226. 66-1227. 66] Then look for these industries. [1227. 66-1231. 66] Develop new technologies and new products.

[1231. 66-1235. 66] This is part of the new market application. [1235. 66-1238. 66] I report here today. [1238. 66-1239. 66] Thank you.
