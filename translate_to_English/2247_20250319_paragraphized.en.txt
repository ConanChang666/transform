This is the beginning of my briefing. So, this time we will start from the introduction of the direct company, we will no longer explain, that directly from the operational performance of this piece began to explain. Operating performance, then let's briefly report that we have just released the 2024 annual report BS, that in the BS part, the total of our assets is 231 billion, that total liability is 9.8 billion, that total equity is 133 billion, that net worth per share is 164,72. In terms of simple financial ratio, no more than is likely to be stable or stable, at 42. 4%, the flow is about 190. 8 percent, so the whole financial structure is stable.

The main reason for this growth is mainly from new car sales, our sales of the new car sales of about 13.6 percent, the main sales of the new car sales of our brand VMW, the sales of which this year's sales of the new electric car sales in 2024 is very bright, so the sales volume of the overall VMW sales of the new car sales is about 80% higher than in 2023, so the overall sales of the new car sales of the new gem kit has not grown significantly, about 3%, but the proportion of the new car in the new car, including 911, 718, and then it is a bit higher, so the overall gem kit price has grown about 14 percent, so the next two factors drive, so we have a significant growth 13. 35 cent.

The grey part is the used car, which grew from 26.800 billion to 33.79 billion, and that grew by 25.9 percent, which is the highest among the three businesses. The after-sales service has grown from 48.1.5 billion to 49.900 million, maintaining a steady growth of about 3.8 percent. So the overall revenue has grown from 508 billion to 576 billion, and the growth is 3.4 percent. The after-sales service has decreased from 9.47 percent to 8.67 percent, and the pre-sales car sales have grown from 90.53 percent to 91.3 percent, which is why we just reported that because of the product portfolio, so our gross profit margin has decreased from the previous year.

As the second quarter is a new year-end vehicle, so called a new year-end vehicle is produced in the current year, so the current year-end production, such as in January 2025, when the new car arrived in Hong Kong after January, now falls into March or later, so the second quarter will be a high season of delivery. So in the second quarter of last quarter last year revenue is 157.49 billion, which is also a record high. The fourth quarter last quarter last year, 140.86 billion, that is obviously higher than the fourth quarter of 2023, because there is a mechanism for regulating delivery, and the fourth quarter of 2024 is not doing a regulating action, so the fourth quarter of 2020 revenue is relatively normal, so the fourth quarter is better than every quarter of 2023.

The dividend distribution situation is good again. On March 12th, the Board of Directors resolved to distribute a dividend in 2024. The distribution of US stocks was 8.5 cash dividends, which was 77.3%, which was slightly lower than the 2023 81.2. The main reason is that there are two major construction projects in our hands, the capital expenditure case is carried out, one is a 40 in Pandele Taipei and a new exhibition center in the 40 Science Research Center in Taipei.

The other one is that there is also a project in Zhongqing Road in China, which takes into account the future capital needs, so in 2024 a small dividend rate dropped to 7.3, which is the US stock share rate is 18.5. We look at the future outlook of the various business of that future, that car sales in the last five years of Taiwan's automotive market, 21, 22 is likely to be affected by the Russian-Ukraine war, then coupled with the determination of the impact of 2021 and 2022, 44.9 million vehicles, 22 is gradually reduced to 42.9 million vehicles, then one factor after the 2023 is gradually decayed, so its number grew to 47.7 million vehicles, the 2024 because the lack of dividends in Taiwan's market is gradually reduced to 45. The flipping meta car sales are mainly BMW MINI and Porsche. It is another luxury imported car market classified in the import car market, the luxury imported car market in 2023 sales is 10.90 million, the whole Taiwan market sales is 10.96 million, then 2024 is 11.2 million, so although an imported car in 2024 is recession, but in the luxury imported car is still growing 2.7 percent.

This is a statistical study of the main selling brands of our two brands in Jian Li Station, BMW in 2023 is 1.77 million vehicles, and by 2024 is 2.03 million vehicles, the growth ratio is 14.8 percent, the Porsche from 5627 to 5804 vehicles, the growth rate is 3.1 percent, the two brands are growth, that is a Jian Li Station is a listed number. Then, the following is to introduce the main selling of our current car sales products, the focus of the 2023 year, because we sell the imported vehicles, so many vehicles will be published and sales will be three months of the difference, so the second half of the release of the first two in 2023 is the main sales of the new vehicle, the second time also the new sales of the new mini man, the second in 2024, the main sales of the second time also released a new vehicle, the second time also a new sales of the second time, the new sales of the new sales of the second time also released a new bus in the 2024. In 2024, this is a key car released in the first half of 2025, which is the most important, such as the VMW has two cars, the first is the entry-level E-series hatchback RV, it is a entry-level car, the entry-level car its price is about 1.780,000, so this sales is really hot, the other is a BMW's main off-road car X3 a new big change, that car will be released in December last year, that January will start to be the car, of course, the first quarter is likely to be less than the first quarter, because the normal period is not yet, it will be the car will be delivered, the car will be in the first quarter, the dealer order in the queue order is currently more than 1300, so this is a very strong sales hot in the market, which will lead to the year's the growth of this year.

That first quarter of 2025, there were two more models, one for the two series of Coupe double-door sports cars, and the other for the iX1. That was before the iX1 was released, but its previous specifications were dual-motor four-wheel-drive prices, with a standard price of about 220 and 228 million. As for the iX1 eDrive20, it turned into a single motor, a forward-drive, and it was priced at $1.9 million, which is an entry price of less than 2 million.

That was about last week, and the distribution agency had a formal announcement. That was the part of the car sales, then we look at the electric vehicle part. Here is a listing of an electric vehicle market in Taiwan, which in 2023 was 24778, and the total number of electric vehicles market in Taiwan grew to 38000, 2034, that growth rate was about 50%. That accounted for a total market volume of 5.2 percent to 8.3 percent. That luxury also grew from a luxury car market to a luxury car market in 2023.

Of course, the domestic electric vehicle market must be Tesla, which sold about 1 million 5277 units last year, accounting for about 59% of the total electric vehicle market. The remaining 10,000 units, the remaining 10,000 units, the remaining 10,000 units of the luxury car brand, fell apart. The BMW said that the remaining 10,000 units sold about 6000, 8000 units, and the market share was about 24.61. The Mercedes said that our competition, our competition brand, the Mercedes accounted for about 9.38%, which means the BMW won more than twice as much as last year.

Then let's look at the number of electric vehicles sold by our brand. That BMW sold 3407 electric vehicles in 2023, which grew to 6367 units by 2024, with a growth rate of about 86.9%. That is why the BMW brand sold several electric vehicles in the electric vehicle market last year, which led to more than 80% sales growth. One BMW electric vehicle accounted for 32% of the total BMW sales, much higher than that we just said, the BMW brand was 32%.

This year, Porsche launched a new electric vehicle, Makang's electric vehicle model, which is a pure electric vehicle, which was also listed in January, and sales performance is quite good, which will lead to a sales ratio of Porsche's electric vehicle this year. This is the current line-up of BMW's electric vehicle sales, which includes XY's IX, both of which are actually listed as the sales ratio of electric vehicles in Taiwan last year. These two are actually listed as the sales ratio of electric vehicles in Taiwan last year, and the two are actually very good at selling last year, and the two are actually very good at last year's sale, and the two are actually very good at last year's sale, and the two are very good at last year's sale.

The Porsche, the original product called Taycan, is the first pure electric sports car in Taiwan, Taycan, because it reached the end of the product, so the agent released Taycan 2 at the end of last year. The other one also reported on the foot-rest of the train, Macon also launched a full pure electric train called Macon, Macon 4, which is actually a good thing, the 1st and 2nd month of the delivery is also ideal, the driving BMW in the first two months of sales volume compared to the last year, compared to the last year of the year of the year about 20 % growth.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the verbatim texts provided by the user and convert them from the verbatim format to paragraphs. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine these sentences into paragraphs in logical order, while keeping the order and content of the original sentences.

This may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph, and then merging them. First, I read all the sentences to understand the overall content. It looks like this transcript mainly discusses the sales performance of Bend Cloud Motors in 2024, the condition of the used car market, the after-sales maintenance business, and the capital expenditure plan. Each section may require a separate segment. For example, the first part refers to the market performance of pure electric vehicles, followed by the sale of brand BMW MINI and Porsche tram products.

In the process, I need to ensure that the sentences within each section are consistent and logically part of the same topic. For example, on the part of the used car market, data from 2024 to 2025 should be combined into a paragraph. Similarly, the capital expenditure plan involves multiple projects that require paragraph processing, but each project may need to be combined. It is important to note that some sentences may have timestamps, but the content is continuous and should be combined.

For example, regarding the construction of the four-course exhibition, from start time to budget, integration of existing outlets, relocation plans, etc., should be put in the same paragraph. At the same time, to check if there is a duplicate or need to adjust the order. For example, users mentioned that "there is a used car market in Taiwan", the following sentences are about the used car market data and should be merged into a paragraph.

Finally, make sure that no sentences are missing and that there is an appropriate transition between paragraphs. For example, after discussing the used car market, the natural transition to after-sales maintenance and then the capital expenditure plan will make the entire report clearer. After completing the preliminary segmentation, I will read the whole paragraph verbatim again to check if the user's requirements are met: no delete anything, keep the original sequence, and the logical coherence between paragraphs. If there are any further adjustments, it is necessary to ensure that the original intention or structure is not changed. In summary, the process requires careful reading, logical analysis and structural reconstruction, while strictly adhering to the user's non-delete, non-written requirements.

It's a pure electric tram. It's also a good performance in the market. That's what we're selling right now. The BMW MINI and Porsche are selling.

A sales product for a train. Then take a look at a used car market in Taiwan. Taiwan's used car market was in 2024. It grew by about 0.5 per cent compared to 2023. The number of sales increased from 41.2 million to 41.5 million.

We sell the brand BMW MINI and Porsche one. A listed number in the used car market. That is to say, the number of our three brands. 2024 is also a maintenance growth of 0.6%. That's what we've just reported.

Sales were up 25%. That was the whole. Sales of used car market. Performance was quite eye-opening. That was mainly because the first was used car. This department was established in recent years.

So it's also an uptrend. And that's what we do for an organization. Slowly improve the configuration and development of a person in that organization. So getting a good result last year was pretty good. So the whole revenue grew by 25%.

We think it's a used car market in 2025. Because the whole new car market is about 2025. We expect a competition for the new car to be a bit more intense. Because the brands are not currently available. So the competition is much more intense.

That's why we believe that this year's used car market will continue to work hard to run this part. But growth rates don't have a way to grow as high as 2024.

Let's take a look at our after-sales maintenance. After-sales maintenance. Bande Cloud Motors achieved a 3.8% growth in 2024 after-sales maintenance. That said, we believe that the number of outbound vehicles currently in circulation is 4.7% growth.

We believe that this is the business. A maintenance business after the sale is expected to continue this year. It should still maintain a steady growth of about 3-4%. Then it is a capital expenditure plan for Bander Cloud Motors. There are two new booths in 2020 and 2023. Including the VMW Bander Kaohsiung and Porsche Cloud Motors.

The two showrooms were built and sold to us after they were completed. It was helpful. So the performance of Bandcloud cars in recent years increased year-on-year. Profits were also increased year-on-year. We currently have two approved capital expenditure plans for the Board of Directors. One is the VMW Bend Taichung.

That land is the land we go to buy for our Bend cloud car. The board approved a total budget of $1.3 billion. It was in November 2023. Commencement. It is expected to be 2026. That is, it is expected to start trial operation in the second quarter of next year to the third quarter.

One of our revenues can also be beneficial. The other approved capital expenditure plan is VMW. Bande Taipei's four sections. It was started in April 2024. The total budget was $1.1 billion.

That is, it will be integrated in the present. We have several points in Taipei point. I will integrate it. Then move to the inside of the four sections. That we believe in. After adding four points.

Not only does it help in our one car sales. That was originally around the whole four divisions. There is currently no capacity for after-sales repairs. So one of the four divisions was built after the completion of one of the four divisions. A operation of our after-sales repairs is also helpful. So we believe in both.

After the completion of the production supervision will be helpful for our future performance growth. That is my report. Thank you for the company's explanation.
