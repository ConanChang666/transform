<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so all the original sentences must be kept intact. Next, I check the verbatim content provided.

This means that I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or paragraph, and merge them, while retaining the timestamps and the original order. First, I will analyze them one by one, to see which sentences can be combined into paragraphs. For example, several timestamps at the beginning of the meeting are reminders of the start of the meeting and can be combined into a paragraph.

Similarly, part of the balance sheet and cash flow also need to remain the same, but it may be necessary to adjust the format to make it easier to read. It is important to note that the user-provided transcripts have some time-stamps between large intervals, such as from 270.00 to 300.00, which may require segmentation. At the same time, some sentences may belong to the same subject, such as about revenue, gross margin, fees, etc., and can be combined into paragraphs. During the process, I need to make sure that each timestamp corresponding sentence is placed correctly, and the transition between paragraphs is natural.

In addition, the sentences referred to by the user as "definitely enough" and "definitely enough" may need to be handled separately, but according to the user's requirements, all content must be retained, so it is necessary to confirm whether these are actual contents of the meeting, or possible errors. If the actual content must be retained; if it is an error, it may be necessary to contact the user to confirm, but according to the current information, only assume that the correct. Finally, check whether the entire converted paragraphs are smooth, whether all the original content is properly preserved, without omissions or errors. Make sure that the correspondence between the timestamps and the sentences is correctly separated, but not using any other format, such as the bullets or numbers, to meet the user's requirements. In summary, I need to group the timestamps and corresponding sentences by logic, merge all the paragraphs, while keeping all the original content remains unchanged and ensure the correct format.

</think> The following is the collated paragraph-based transcription (totally retain all the original content, only the paragraph format is adjusted): --- [0.0 00-12. 52] Answer Electronics Co., Ltd.'s legal statement will begin in a minute.

[272. 24-275. 84] The agenda of the entire meeting today is divided into three parts. [275. 84-278. 40] The first part is the whole 4Q.

[278. 40-280. 00] Explanation of financial statements. [280. 00-282. 16] This part is reported to you by me. [282. 16-284. 80] The second part is Outlook of the whole business. [284. 80-285. 84] Operating outlook. [285. 84-288. 64] The third part is explained by General Manager Tsai. [288. 64-291. 76] The third part is Q&A.

[291. 76-295. 44] This site will open to investors to ask some questions. [295. 44-298. 40] This site will also be hosted by Tsai. [300. 00-304. 40] First of all, this site is completely free of charge. [304. 40-305. 44] This site has a disclaimer. [305. 44-308. 96] Because now the entire external global environment changes. [308. 96-309. 92] It is fast.

[309. 92-311. 76] And there are also some geopolitics. [311. 76-315. 04] So here there are some. [315. 04-311. 68] These changes will affect the whole business. [317. 68-320. 08] The whole future of the company. [320. 08-322. 00] Please invest in advanced. [322. 00-323. 52] Take some time to understand.

[323. 52-328. 08] The potential future risks and opportunities. [328. 08-330. 00] First, let's go to the second section. [330. 00-333. 84] Let's take a look at the statement of the entire financial statements for the fourth Q last year. [333. 84-340. 24] The first page is the entire consolidated selection table for the fourth Q last year. [340. 24-345. 36] Last year, the total revenue for the fourth Q was 60. 400 million. [345. 36-348. 80] QOQ grew approximately 12. 9%.

[348. 80-353. 36] YOY probably declined-0.3%. [353. 36-358. 16] The whole revenue growth was mainly due to the growth of the ice grooving industry in Europe last quarter. [358. 16-359. 84] There was growth in Europe. [360. 00-363. 20] There was a new channel of revenue coming in. [363. 20-366. 40] So the revenue here was relatively significant. [366. 40-368. 96] The Gross Margin portion was 10.7 billion.

[368. 96-372. 16] QOQ increased by approximately 10.2%. [372. 16-376. 64] YOY was a decline of 4.8%. [376. 64-380. 48] Opportunity Expense was part of 10.45 billion. [380. 48-384. 32] QOQ was 17%. [384. 32-388. 16] YOY was an increase of about 26. 6%. [388. 16-389. 44]

[390. 00-392. 00] Compared to QOQ, there is a relatively higher price. [392. 00-395. 12] This is mainly because of the fourth quarter last year. [395. 12-400. 88] This new channel that was incorporated from this side of Europe. [400. 88-404. 08] So the cost of this place will be slightly higher in the fourth quarter. [404. 08-405. 60] The cost of this place is slightly higher. [405. 60-408. 72] This cost is mainly from here.

[408. 72-415. 12] That Opportunity Income part is 25.5 million. [415. 12-418. 56] YOY is a recession of 83%. [420. 00-422. 56] YOY is a recession of 91%. [422. 56-425. 12] Net Income is a recession of 57 million. [425. 12-427.2. 68] QOQ is a recession of 59%. [427.1. 68-430. 24] YOY is a recession of 72%.

[430. 24-436. 64] That Net Income belongs to the owners of the parent company, part of which is 1.3 billion. [436. 64-439. 20] QOQ is a decline of 40%. [439. 20-441. 76] YOY was a decline of 44.8%. [441. 76-444. 32] The basic per share operating in the fourth quarter was 0.44 yuan. [444. 32-448. 00] That was for the whole year of 2020. [448. 00-449. 84] The revenue was 217 million.

[450. 00-452.2. 56] YOY is about to decline 15.9%. [452.1 56-458. 64] This place is mainly part of the whole AIoT. [458. 64-461. 84] The revenue is actually a growth. [461. 84-466. 64] But because there have been reports of the whole green business. [466. 64-469. 60] is still in stock adjustments. [469. 60-471. 60] So the overall revenue is relatively large.

[471. 60-476. 88] So the total two offsets were basically a decline of about 15. 9%. [476. 88-479. 84] That Close Margin was in 2024. [480. 00-485. 12] 39.86 billion QO. [485. 12-487. 68] About YOY was a decline of 13.4%. [487. 68-491. 52] The Approving Expense part is 30.1.2 billion. [491. 52-495. 36] YOY is about to increase by 7%.

[495. 36-498. 56] That portion of Approving Income is 573 million. [498. 56-501. 76] That portion of YOY is about to decline 50%. [501. 76-505. 92] Net Income is about to decline 72% in 2024. [505. 92-508. 16]

[516. 40-520. 24] The basic per share camp was 2.2 billion in 2020. [520. 24-525. 36] There was no relationship between green energy products in 2024. [525. 36-529. 20] affected the distribution of the total profitability. [529. 20-535. 60] Another part was because there was a one-time total landfill in 2023. [535. 60-536. 88] Here was last year.

[540. 00-545. 12] This page is for the entire product group. [545. 12-548. 96] Look at the left part of the whole 4Q. [548. 96-554. 08] Because we were here in Europe last quarter last year. [554. 08-557. 92] The cashier's revenue came in after the whole. [557. 92-560. 48] The green energy portion went from [560. 48-563. 04] 23% in the third quarter went up to 35%.

[563. 04-568. 16] The AIoT part was slightly reduced to 15%. [568. 16-569. 44] That whole. [570. 00-572. 56] The whole part was about 10%. [572. 56-575. 12] The whole age range from the right. [575. 12-578. 96] The first product of 2024 year round. [578. 96-582. 80] Belongs to the AIoT part.

[582. 80-586. 64] Part of IT is about 58% here. [586. 64-587. 92] Yes. [587. 92-593. 04] The second part of the second part is about 30% green energy. [593. 04-599. 44] The third part is the whole original part. [600. 00-603. 84] This page looks at the entire Quantity portion of the revenue on the left. [603. 84-605. 64] In the fourth quarter.

[605. 64-608. 96] rose from 53% in the third quarter to about 60.4 billion. [608. 96-609. 98] here. [609. 98-611. 52] There is a relatively large increase. [611. 52-614. 08] It was just mentioned here mainly from here. [614. 08-616. 38] The whole of Germany here. [616. 38-618. 68] This revenue from the merger came in.

[618. 68-621. 00] Look at that picture on the right. [621. 00-622. 78] The whole Margin section. [622. 78-624. 06] In the fourth quarter. [624. 06-626. 36] It is expected to remain at 17. 7%. [626. 36-627. 64] Although this side. [627. 64-629. 96] Despite the entire green energy product.

[630. 00-631. 80] is adjusted here. [631. 80-636. 14] Because there are some depreciation promotions in the relationship in the dump inventory. [636. 14-639. 48] actually dilutes to the whole resulting.

The following is a re-routing paragraph type transcript:. The 800 million comes from some equipment investment is that some automation equipment investment has some capacity expansion. Some of the investment in the future growth of the entire operation of the plant belongs to the part of the investment is relatively small, only about 100 million is the plant about 800 million is from the entire equipment investment. The incoming cash flow from the entire financing activity is about 2.1 billion out of the present part is about 400 million, more than the whole because the encouragement is about 13.85 billion, because under the company policy are some of the Bole as a high payout ratio an encouraging distribution policy, so the release of the whole free cash is about 16.87 billion long, the entire operation of the entire cash flow from the entire operation of the entire cash into the whole part of the cash should be because the future long-term growth of the whole company.

In addition, the highlight of the CQ, which is a relatively important financial indicator, is about 58% of the total CQ debt ratio compared to the last year, about 58% of the total thick cash and the monthly cash debt ratio is only about 48% of the total current ratio of the current ratio of the current ratio of the health of the current ratio is about 140% of the total cash Conversion Cycle, which is also improved about 125 days from the same period last year. This is mainly because the green energy industry part of the entire year is slightly adjusted here, and the financial structure should be maintained. I generally expect that this year will probably be a relatively small part of the bounce that the entire big rally should be a big rally to look at this next year's situation, so now or through some internal integration, especially the internal organic output growth and the external strategic cooperation of how to increase our value, there are two other ways to increase the overall operation of the momentum I want to pull up this year's one of the biggest focus of the campaign should be, especially in the lot of the other, I want to be a better start next year, this is probably the whole 2024 chief financial officer report with me here to see a demand situation for 2025. Thank you General Manager Tsai and General Lin Financial Secretary Next Online Questioning time If you have any questions about the company, welcome to start asking questions before I have some advanced questions here, and I have to ask you a few questions.

Of course, some of the keyboards with added value, some of the peripherals are not keyboards, like some of the previous investment reports, such peripherals, like some of the touchpads and some other modules. This part is really good last year, and the relative gross profit is also good, so last year the parts of these peripherals were OK. This year, because all these things are standalone, we will be in the future layout in Southeast Asia if we go directly to produce these things, then there will be investment first to ask this whole overseas layout, that is, in the update, in fact, our Thailand factory and this Vietnam factory in the last year have been in mass production, the previous year has been in mass production, that layout should be pretty much the same, including some machinery and equipment, that person, monitoring, it now seems that this year's capacity will be much more than last year's production, and like Vietnam this, our factory will gradually increase the utilization rate, but the demand for this time, it should be very fast, the second season of this year should be compared, but the whole period of the growth is determined at the bottom part of the whole of the mainland, that this is the situation, that is about IT, that investment first to ask the e-bike and Q1 of the Q1 of the Q1 of the Q1 orders, if it is a comprehensive stock, if it is a comprehensive stock, we will be in stock. This is the fourth quarter of the year because of the participation in Globala here, we expect last year's Q1 revenue to be 5.1 billion. This is the quarter of this year because of the participation in Globala here, the Q1 should be low revenue, but I think the bigger the challenge is still due to the improvement of this system, because last year's revenue declined but our gross profit adjustment also benefit, that this year's challenge AOT this part of the growth, green energy this section of the inventory or a relatively large challenge, which is expected this year's proportion of the investment in advance of our chief financial officer's report, the whole green energy and AOT is likely to be a 73 percent of the situation in 2024.

In 2024, I mentioned that last year's total capital expenditure was about 900 million, of which 800 million came from some capacity expansion or some investment in automation related to the equipment, so this is about 800 million is related to the whole rectification. In 114 years, basically here is to resume some increase, then it looks like in 114 years of this year, some investment in the equipment category should be 800 million, but in addition to the entire plant will be slightly more, may be about 500 million, the price is about 13.13 billion or about 1.4 billion. The increase of the whole plant will basically focus on the whole Southeast Asia, then Southeast Asia is like some of us, and some parts of the entire market, there are also some parts of the whole province, there will be some increase in the investment.

This part of the profit is actually difficult to quantify now, because there are some parts of the finance below, but I can talk about that Maori. Basically, his gross profit is basically the part of the group because he is not good at the channel, so the gross profit is not too different from the gross profit of the group, so I think he can contribute in addition to the revenue, Maori's maintenance and promotion should have some attention and help. In addition to the question of this green energy and AOT's proportion, I said here is that last year's proportion is about 73, about 70% of this AOT's green energy.

I think that 2025 is a year to encourage reversal, from the first point last year 217 billion, and that this year we want to have a good opportunity from revenue and profit. The ALTA group for sure, it should be a good opportunity for growth, this is a very important part of the company's current layout, especially in the profit. The green energy part of the bike is about two directions, the first is about this year's bottom tip adjustment, or the entire inventory decomposition, this year we will have a lot of time to adjust it.
