We've always wanted to. We hope to make a floor price for 5 bucks. For this promise, the promise of the amount is very high. That's what I think.

"We have been in the last year, and we have been in the last six months," he said, "and we have been in the last six months of the year, and we have been in the last six months of the year."

There are 160 billion companies. The company has full capacity. We want to give back to shareholders. Here you can see. We probably started last year. We started with a small amount.

"Let us make a covenant with the Lord, and let him make a covenant with us, and let him make a covenant with us, and let him make a covenant with us, and let him make a covenant with us."

I. I. I. Allot from the capital instruments. It is actually a tax-exempt one. It is a reward to the shareholders. It can help.

It is possible to take care of shareholders. Then again, we also want the company's share capital. In fact, we have been in the past ten years. We have been more than 2.7 billion. We want the company to have the opportunity. A little to grow our share capital.

And the time will come when we shall be gathered together, and we shall be gathered together, and we shall be gathered together, and we shall be gathered together, and we shall be gathered together, and we shall be gathered together.

That's what we're working on right now. The first thing we're working on is the construction map. First, we're going to see it on the north side of Beitou. We've got a factory in the north side of Beitou right now. There are two residential cases.

We have officially designated the name Huagu Chuangyuan Park. It is a case built in conjunction with the Zhengda nylon. This case is expected to be sold this summer. We will have an external belt to start selling. Then we will be back before.

A residential case on the north side of Wenning North Road. The news is also reported. That is to follow HTC. That is to get the land with the relatives of the king's house. That land is also expected this year. We are going to launch a residential case.

It is in Fuxing Park. So we think it's a place where it's located. Its landscape is great. Then again, we launched Huagu upper forest a few years ago. This residential case we expect to complete next year. It's now over 95% sales rate.

There is probably no one left to sell, so we finished it next year. The case is sold out. We are confident. We talk about other cases first. We jump back.

The central land and the land of the times. This year's focus. This time we have a new residential case, called Dunhua. It is in the middle of the urbanization of the city of Huana. There is a case under construction in mainland China next to it.

We are right next door to him. The middle school Dunhua intersection is located at the heart of Taipei City. Then there is no double. It is at our company Xinyi Guangfu intersection. This case we launched last year in the fourth quarter to now. We have sold nearly 60 percent.

We are living in a house. Because we are separated from him, we include a storefront. It includes a general office that includes a house. The average price of sales on this side of our house is close to 2.1 million.

He said it was a very high price. Then we sold a pretty good case. This year we expect to start going to Huaguo University in the summer. I have only one or two unsold cases at the moment. So this case will be the two homes we are going to deliver this year.

Then Hua Guosheng went on to have no problem with him. He was also unsold with the remaining figures. It was expected to be completed next year. That was when we actually pushed it from the third quarter last year to the fourth quarter. We recorded a new case.

The Huaguo nomad river here is one of Huaguo Zhixin. Huaguo nomad river first introduced the case before the 7th wave of the central bank regulation of 919. At that time, our case was launched in a short time to sell to 90%. The unit price was also sold on average about that time from the painting area. Then after 919.

We launched the Huaguo Zhixin. This case was after the central bank's comprehensive weighting control of 919, but we have sold nearly 90% of it since the end of September. The unit price is the same as the picture, so it's actually from last year to the present.

us, and us.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the provided transcription fragments to see if there are any formatting issues or areas that need special attention. For example, if timestamps are correct, whether the sentences are coherent. Next, I need to arrange each timestamp corresponding sentence in order and combine them into a naturally smooth paragraph while retaining the original timestamp information. During the process, I need to make sure that each sentence remains in its original place without any modification. This may involve merging multiple short sentences into longer sentences, or adjusting the order of the sentences in line with the logic, but it is necessary to strictly follow the user's requirements and not adding or deleting anything.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the correctness of professional terms and terminology, such as "Congde Stone Road Case", "Central Self-Directed", etc., to ensure that these names are not mishandled during the conversion process. At the same time, the format of the timestamp needs to be consistent and may need to adjust the punctuation marks or spaces to make the entire document look neater. During the conversion process, you may encounter a logical jump between some sentences, and at this time you need to determine whether you need to add a link or adjust the structure, but you can not change the original intention. For example, the user mentions "that we have a five-way case is right there," followed by "we have our own new Huabo customer service center," the two sentences may need to clarify the relationship between the service center location and the project.

</span> <span class="orgFullName-prefix">Church of Scientology</span> <span class="orgFullName-suffix">Auckland</span>

So we have a good school district next to it, and the Marion American school, etc. So we learned from the conference that the current loan in Taichung is 40 million, they hit 40 million, in fact, this is a very obvious difference between you and the seller. So we have a slight modification of the floor number of the Chongde stone case, so we use two plus a room to three, two paper level to three paper level of the lord. So let the price then bear the car park, and basically most of the room types won't hit the central bank's current threshold. So we feel confident.

Then, in December last year, we had a new Huabu customer service center on our own. So we now include the next Chongde Stone Road, our sales will all be focused on the customer service center. That's because we have our own credit center that can be used for a long time and will not interfere with the new construction on site. We can also pull the line to sell gradually.

The center is located on the south side of the Nangang road, southport Kunyang Station. It now has a lot of large development projects, including the Taiwan Railways such as the crane field, including the changes like the Taiwan Electric Power, and then even next to our case is the Runtai Runtai Building, which they built next to. It was just next door to NVIDIA that they rented some 2500 flat floors. So if we had a suggestion, if you are now going to the 7th section of the Civic Avenue to the other side, you could see that there are about a dozen hanging towers on the left side of the building, which is under construction.

So, we think about the future development, it's a promising development. Then we're in the building itself, in fact, we want to build a high-end A-level office corporate headquarters, we're including the lead's Golden Bell logo, then green building smart building stabilization building energy efficiency building, etc., and so on. In fact, the major international manufacturers' supply chain care about these ESG things, this building is all in place. So we think that the building we're next to decommissioning, and then adding that NVIDIA has already moved in.

We also hope that there will be good news to be announced soon. The second is the land of the times, the land of the times is really not far from it, in the indigo hotel in the past decades of the place. It is also the second wallboard on the side of the strip, the first is the national financial control building next door. What is the problem with the land of the times and the central land of the two cases?

In the time and the central part of the land, which we will have at this time will have a source of revenue, which is also the source of this year's revenue we hope these two cases will be able to contribute to this year's revenue. It would have been the home of Da'an and Delo of China, which is our plan for this year's revenue. This is just because we just put all the cases on the map over again, where we have some basic information on our projects for you to reference. Here is our timeline of the project, so we just said that in 2025 we have four cases this year, the two companies will complete the two homes.

This year, we started with two office revenue targets. Then we started with two office revenue targets. Then we started here. That's where we launched the development method, and this year we sold the rest, which is probably a plan for the two years. Then it came to a later year, it was like we measured the second phase of sales of the remaining 60 homes, and then Magawa was close to completion, so by 2027 our revenue visibility, and even 2028 if the two sales are close to 70%, the credit is close to completion, the next few years the revenue visibility is actually recorded, and in fact, it is being shown.

This year, I plan to take the fifth base in Taichung, which is the most recent Fengde Road project, and then the Huagu Jade City, which is in the reconstruction area of the Yulong city, and the other Zhengdaxing store that is the other side of the factory. Then after the big year, we left the Easternization we talked about more, and the Easternization at the middle of the school East Chemical Intersection, the Easternization of the Easternization of the middle school, and we had to do it with the block base of the center to overcome the blessing center. Then, of course, we will continue to replenish our land inventory, but now we have the site of the land inventory will be based in Twin North.

This is why we believe that in the case of two cases in Taipei, one is a high-end, one is a general, anti-epidemic design is the general public, detoxification is not good. So we think that in the case of two north side it is still a case, the developers themselves are trying to sharpen the highlights of their own projects, to strengthen their product sales points, and then to strengthen their own product strength, coupled with is a long-running developer's brand, and then with the appropriate pricing, if these conditions are in place, it can continue to sell.

This is the current situation in Taipei, which is like last year, the modernity of the bank, then some people will say, OK next time when we face the door to the house, we will not have customers, facing banks can not lend, and then delay the time to close the house. From our latest understanding with the bank, in September, the central bank announced that at that time, everyone in the financial industry included a customer, we did not know how to respond to the situation, then a case may be, usually legend wait for March 4 months, or even half months to borrow money to you. But we know now, the loan time has been shortened to 2 to 3 weeks, the bank has actually speed up a lot, because there is a daily consumption of customers will pay mortgage, the bank's water level will continue out.

So this year, I included my new project, even included my budget to buy this year, the company's current capital is very adequate, very good enough to cope with the future situation, so I want the client with the company side, the money part, the company has arranged, so the current company is also, this is not the company is worried about things, so this part of the situation should not be good. So of course the overall market situation, we believe that this year, the volume should come down, but the price will not be adjusted, or the price will be likely to see each case, it is where it is, a supply and demand situation, if there are some comparisons before the amount of those areas, it is possible, some of course, because he is impatient, he needs to sell his urgent money, he must make a relatively large concession, to seek a fast is a fast deal. These conditions will be determined by the region, but the overall operating environment as we feel, the overall, the overall, the situation, the overall, the situation, the overall, the fact that the company is that the overall, and then everyone is to try to carry their own to fill their own performance, there are some of the ESG, there are some of the company, there are some references.
