<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the rules of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed verbatimly and keep the original intention intact. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like this is a verbatim record of financial reporting meetings, including timestamps and corresponding content.

This means that I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or paragraph, and then merge them, but I can't miss anything. First, I read the whole transcript and understand the overall structure. Beginning with the introduction of the welcome word and the meeting process, then there is a detailed explanation of the financial data, including income, gross profit, R&D expenses, business benefits, net after tax, etc. Then there is information about the balance sheet and investment, and finally the summary and transition to the general manager's speech.

For example, meeting process introductions, financial statements, balance sheets, investment activities, liabilities and shareholders' equity, etc. The sentences under each topic may need to be merged into paragraphs, but the order and integrity of the original sentence must be maintained. It is important to note that some sentences may repeat or need to be adjusted in order to comply with logic. For example, when describing the impact of exchange rates, there is a repeated mention of the GDR fund raising, and it is necessary to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph.

In addition, timestamps and time intervals can help identify the beginning and end of different parts. During the processing process, I check them one by one to make sure that nothing is missing. For example, on the part of R&D expenses, there are multiple sentences that mention changes in QOQ and YY, which need to be merged into the same paragraph.

For example, the introduction part of the finance minister may contain multiple sentences, but belongs to the same paragraph and should be combined. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will check again whether all the original content is preserved, without omissions or errors. Ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, while maintaining the original sequence and content of each sentence. If there are uncertain places such as duplication or possible typographical errors, further confirmation may be required, but no modifications or deletions may be made according to the user's request, so it must be handled strictly in accordance with the original text.

</think> The following is a paragraph-by-text transcript (totally retain all the original content, undeleted or rewritten): --- I am Mr. Ming Yu-hsing, Chief Financial Officer of Iptech, and welcome you to participate in the Iptech Investor Conference. We will conduct our financial and business reports for the first quarter of 2025. After the presentation, you will enter the Q&A stage, and online investment friends can enter your question in the bottom right corner of the screen. We will reply to you in a unified manner.

The 3rd and 4th pages are a brief overview of Apple's technology and provide you with a reference. The conference will first introduce the key financial figures for the first quarter of 2025. General Manager Hung Chi-hun will report on the operation status and future outlook before conducting Q&A. Today's team will reply to questions online, in addition to Mr. Hung Chi-hung and me, Mr. Chen Wen-liang, Mr. Xue Zeyuan, Vice President of Sales, and Mr. Liu Zongming.

First of all, I would like to report my financial situation. First of all, I would like to state the situation of the combined waters in the first quarter of 2025. The combined revenue for the first quarter was NT$9,700 million, with a 20% reduction in QOQ, mainly due to a decrease in the single-season shipment of BHM and SC-CAP products this quarter. YY on IoT, QOQ increased by 30%, gross profit of NT$4,500 million, QOQ decreased by 31%, YY increased by 32%, gross margin of 46%, QOQ decreased by 7 percentage points, mainly from adverse changes in the product portfolio and YY remained the same.

QOQ's R&D expense is $1.95 billion, quarterly decrease of $34 million, QOQ decreases 15%, year-on-year increase of $37 million, YY increase of 23%, QOQ decrease of 15%, QOQ decrease of $37 million, YY increase of 23%, QOQ decrease of 15%, QOQ decrease of 15%, QOQ's customer project is less than the previous quarter, resulting in the corresponding R&D expense decrease of the previous quarter, which is the normal fluctuation in accounting recognition. Operating profit of $1.8 billion, affected by the decline in revenue and profit margin, QOQ decrease of 50%, YY increase of 66%, which is the benefit from the increase in revenue YY. QOQ's operating profit is 18%, due to a decrease in profit margin of the first quarter.

The Company has a capital reserve of $2.5 billion, of which $18 billion comes from the fund raised by GDR. Due to the Company's GDR fund raising, the Company has a capital reserve of $2.5 billion, of which $18 billion comes from the fund raised by GDR. Due to the Company's GDR fund raising, the Company's GDR fund raising has not changed significantly in addition to research and development investment.

There are about 90 million to 100 million interest income per quarter, balancing possible exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding GDR-related exchange income and income tax implications, the proposed outsourced information will be explained on the next page. The company currently does not use foreign exchange active avoidance means. The main consideration is that the spreads in USD and NT dollars have provided a part of the natural avoidance.

In addition, considering the geopolitical risks, the Company will continue to diversify the regional allocation of the Group's funds. At the same time, we will expand overseas investments. The Board has agreed to expand the R&D center in the United States on May 2, strengthening the investment area of the United States and expanding the operational layout of the central region. Net profit for the first quarter was $103 billion and the income tax fee was $89 million. Excluding the impact of the unallocated surplus tax on the first quarter, the effective income tax rate was about 17%, and the net profit after the tax was $34.7 billion, of which the net profit belongs to the owners of the Company was $33 billion.

In the first quarter of 2025, the net income of GDR was $280 million, which means the net impact of interest income of $92 million, the exchange of interest of $30 million, and the net profit of financial assets valued at $60 million. Excluding the impact of GDR-related exchange rates, the net profit of the first quarter will be $285 million, which is attributable to the company's owners' tax return of $2.7 billion. QOQ decreased by 20%, YY increased by 52%, attributable to the company's owners' net profit after tax return of 28%, and adjusted earnings per share of $67. The consolidated balance sheet portion of the total assets at the end of the quarter increased by $1.7 billion.

At the end of the first quarter, the total amount of receivables was $54 billion, an increase of 18 million compared to the end of last year. The total amount of receivables was in good condition for two months. The total amount of inventory was $11.1 billion, a decrease of $90 million, a 7% decline. The current stock remained at a reasonable level in about 7 months, and will continue to be dynamically managed according to the stage.

The Company has invested approximately $40 million in US startup PowerLatest tax plus investment amount. Since March, the Company has been determined under substantive control to include 28% of its RFID chip design company OneStand Technology in the consolidated financial statements, thus reducing the amount of investment in the adoption of equity law. The total debt amount at the end of the year is 2.4 billion yuan, the debt ratio at 18%, and the impact of the tax increase from the end of the year.

As mentioned earlier, the company is not a 100% stake in OneSend, so the equity items in the quarter relatively generated a non-controlling interest of 1.80 million yuan. After the reduction of the non-controlling interest, the amount of interest in the company's industry is 11.1 billion yuan. As the first quarter resolution of the surplus distribution of the cash dividend of 11.4 billion yuan, the net equity value decreased from the end of last year, and the net value per share was 68.49 yuan.

We will report the results of the first quarter of our operation. We will report to you in the form of IoT RAM, VHM, and SC-CAP, in the form of three product lines.

First of all, we see revenue and gross profit. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue was $7.5 billion, a 20% decrease compared to the previous quarter. YYYY increased by 30%. IoT RAM revenue was $85.5 billion, accounting for 88% of revenue. QoQ decreased by 2.7%, and YYYY increased by 37%.

QoQ decreased by 78% and YYYY decreased by 36%. In QoQ, the VHM WaverSales and IP Licensing decreased by 66%. In addition, in the SC-CAP product line, revenue of $66 million was decreased by 36%, and YYYY increased by 65%.

The 5 percentage points of gross profit VHM revenue reduction contribution is the main reason. Others are the negative impact of YOT RAN and SC-CAP portfolio changes. The gross profit margin portion fluctuates as the product portfolio changes. Next, let me explain the status of profit in the X-CAP product line. On this page, the light portion is the profit margin.

YY has increased by 66%. Operating profit 18% and YY has increased by 4 percentage points. The influence of the company's business, the company's business, especially the IoT RAN business, presents a more obvious seasonal factor. The comparison of YY is more able to present the company's performance.

In the first quarter, the net profit was $34.6 billion, a decrease of $1.56 billion compared to the previous quarter. The main revenue was lower than the previous quarter, as well as the impact of the exchange interest. The net interest rate was 35%. Next, I will explain the operating status of the three product lines in the first quarter of this year, respectively.

First, let's take a look at IoT product lines. This quarter's revenue was $85.5 billion, with QoQ down 3%, and YYYY increased by 37%. The main applications of IoT RAN are Connectivity, Wearable, Video, Audio, and Smartphone. The main applications of Connectivity are Communication Module, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.

We have previously reported to you that the market is more concentrated, competition is more intense, and gross profit is relatively low. The increase in revenue of the communication module has an impact on the overall gross profit margin of approximately 1 percentage point of this quarter. In the wearable section, the amount of this quarter decreased by 36% from the previous quarter, mainly due to the seasonal demand, which also included the services provided by the fourth quarter customers, and the effect of early pull.

I want to tell you further. Wearable devices are a thriving application market, and this market pays a lot of attention to the user experience, with more and more devices, the more complex and diverse specifications. In addition, the introduction of AI, the need for memory capacity and bandwidth, is growing. With the diversification of products and the introduction of various new features, the introduction of special AI capabilities, so that sales and single-machine memory capacity increases at the same time, resulting in a large space for growth.

Connectivity is a big market and price competition is very intense. Still, customers still have the most confidence in the APP's products. In the market, we continue to invest in close cooperation with customers, launch more high-performance, better cost-effective memory solutions, to enhance customer product competitiveness, and continue to enhance our competitive advantage.

In addition, our RT-RAN has introduced a new generation of specifications this year, the APS-RAN. APS-RAN offers several times more than our current product ratings, meeting the demands of our customers for performance and reducing power consumption. APS-RAN is the best solution for wearables such as the pursuit of high performance and long standby applications, the pursuit of high performance and long standby applications.

We call it IPD. SC-CAP product line revenues were $66 million this quarter, a decrease of 36% compared to the previous quarter and a 65% increase in YYY. IPC has entered mass production since the third quarter of last year, and revenues have continued to grow.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcription: Due to the impact of customer's initial supply chain capacity fluctuations in mass production, we are currently seeing a steady increase in IPC revenue this year. In addition, in the IPD part, the application embedded in Substrate is currently in the process validation market, and this quarter's revenue is reduced, mainly due to the relatively small amount of customer samples purchased this quarter. Next, I would like to use these three graphs to illustrate the application of SC-CAP in the 2. 5D packaging.

The first is the silicon intermediate, the Silicon Interfoser, which uses silicon wafer as an intermediate. This 2.5D package technology used in the silicon middle is often referred to as COVAX-S, which is used in the industry for products below 4 Radical Sizes. It is applied to products below 4 Radical Sizes.

In the third quarter of last year, there was a significant revenue contribution, and in the second quarter there will be an acceleration of Rainout. The second quarter there will be an acceleration of Rainout. Modding Base Interposer, the part in the middle of our left picture, is another option when the 2D package needs a larger area. The SOC and other memory components, such as RDL Redistribution Layer, connect, and combine it in a package, the modding method. This Modding Base Interposer's 2. 5D is often referred to as Core Air, a package that requires more and more separate capacitors.

In addition, the third application is to migrate to the packaging substrate, Embedded Subtrade's application, such as the picture on the left. Whether Core as Air or Core as Air, we will need to migrate to dozens of IPDs in the substrate in the future. The market is very large. We have been operating for a while and have been working with our customers for several Tier1 substrate factories, collaborative process development and verification, and have reached maturity.

This quarter's revenue was NT$54 million, down 78% from the previous quarter, mainly due to the decrease in the Walfer Sales of the miner, which was lower than the previous quarter. The decrease in the decrease in the market demand for the miner's Walfer Sales is a factor. In addition, this quarter's revenue was also reduced, mainly due to the relatively small drop in the Milestone listed in the quarter. The VHN revenue YY decreased by 36%. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you several stages of our VHN.

The first phase is the early design validation of the VHN product architecture. We have been developing 3D memory since 2018. At this stage, we operate with the early adoption of customers, collaboratively verifying the performance of the VHN, and the establishment of the industry's 3D memory supply chain ecosystem.

We are currently shipping around 20,000 pieces. Our market for mining machines proves the value of VHN. Using a relatively mature process, we have achieved several times more performance than advanced process GPUs. Mainstream customers have also started to notice VHN. We began to discuss the implementation of VHN in AI and HPC applications.

At this stage, in addition to the 1 plus 1 VHN architecture, we also began to design and develop multi-layer stacks with our mainstream customers, our VHN stack. These projects were validated at the end of last year, further deepening our customers' confidence in VHN and VHN stack, and entering the mass production product specification discussion phase.

In addition, from the market point of view, the iteration of AI software in the past is far faster than iteration of hardware, the mainstream general GPU graphics chip with HVM is the main hardware architecture of AI training. Since the demand for AI inferences brought about by deep AI models, we found that more and more customers began to study ASIC as the core of AI inference, while with VHN, custom 3D memory, to achieve the overall advantages of system performance, power consumption and cost.

There is progress, and we will report to you every quarter. There is progress, and we will report to you every quarter. There is a lot of uncertainty about the current economic environment, including the US high-tech regulatory and tariff wars, especially the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which add a lot of variables to the operating environment.

We also expand our operations overseas to reduce operational risks. This is my report, thank you.

Next, enter your question in the lower right corner of the screen. Enter your question in the lower right corner of the screen. We will reply the same reply. We will reply the same reply. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The first question I asked right now is the question I would like to ask about the overall operation of 2025. The first question I would like to ask right now is the question I would like to ask about the overall operation of 2025.

Whether or not U.S. tariffs have changed from the current view. Whether or not the current view is changed due to U.S. tariffs. The main structural changes that I have answered this year will have significant growth compared to last year's revenue is that the IPC will have a significant contribution to the overall increase in demand and then there will be a significant increase in revenue in other parts of the tariff impact we do not see too obvious impact on the next question. The problem is that I am here to answer the company's strategy in foreign exchange management thinking that the deposit rate difference between the US dollar and Taiwan dollar is two to three percent of the interest rate difference is a natural hedge we do not compare to the active exchange rate hedge, so when the exchange rate has some rapid changes, we will have a commodity change can not avoid a certain degree of loss on our account, at the same time, our company has already made some funds dispatching, including investment subsidiaries to reduce the loss of exchange rate on the account, I supplement this question may be more concerned about the issue in the current uncertain environment, although we think that there will be some loss of exchange rate in the short time, but the medium or long time, we can be able to bear the next question of the next question of the next question of whether there is no change in IoT RAN in these quarters, whether the growth or if there is a chance to see growth, or if there is a problem I ask the product center Mr. The deep groove capacitors that adopt the Luo set process are currently seen in the market are few competitors, mainly because the market has just begun the advantages of AEP's stack capacitors is that the density of the capacitor is higher than the deep groove capacitors and the thickness can be thinner the next question is about IPC IPD 2. 5D Roadmap to see which one will bring a relatively large revenue contribution is expected to mass production of electricity, my Xue Deyuan, this question I came to answer the IPC customers have already started to buy the products at the end of last year, so this year's revenue contribution will be more significant.

In the long run, we believe that the IPD application will be wider, so its market size will be bigger. Next question, what will happen to Interposer's main fabs, the processes used, and the main capacitors that work together? The technical barrier is that our IPC, Interposer with Silicon Capacitor, is a custom process that adopts the low-firming line of niche power. In terms of process technology, how to provide high capacitance and yield is the key.

Next question, when will I get more revenue for the C-CAP IPD? Is it NRE or WAVE? I'll answer this question. The current IPD shipment is mainly embedded in the substrate application process development required samples, so shipping will be more unstable. It's just mentioned that the process validation will be carried out in a few months? The process validation will be completed by the end of this year, but the speed of mass production depends on the needs of the customer project.

The application of this type is mainly for customized IPD, so there will be sales of NRE and products in future revenues. The shipment of that product is not necessarily WAVE shipping, and customers in this industry have more specific requirements for shipping. The current shipment of IPD products is still a sample, but not as much as mass production. Now we are more difficult to estimate. Next question, how many layers of BHM stacks can be stacked up? Can the existing DRAM process meet customer needs?

I am currently developing a DRAM that stacks eight layers. Can existing DRAM processes meet the needs of current customers? However, in the future, only Tier1 DRAM manufacturers will have the opportunity to meet the needs of mainstream customers. The next question is whether the first quarter revenue decline is affected by the U.S. ban?

Next question, what is the number and progress of BHM products other than POCs? I answer this question. There are many customers, the most cutting-edge customers have basically completed the technical solution discussion, followed by some commercial discussion of the supply chain confirmation. Next question, is BHM, IPC, IPD related to AI HPC? Can you tell us the main application areas separately? BHM is mainly to provide the high bandwidth and low power memory required by AI accelerators and network chips.

IPC and IPD are high-density capacitors for all high-speed computing and AI chips, providing SIP signal quality and power quality. Next question, PSMC has repeatedly mentioned the development focus of 3D Staking with AI universal cooperation, can you explain the main collaboration projects and ways of cooperation? Is PSMC provide DRAM?

However, the mainstream products of the future mainstream applications, that is, very large parts of the product, because the reason for the capacity will be TL1 DRAM. Next question, will the company execute treasury stocks? The company will always discuss this issue, and the conclusion is not to do so. Next question, does the company mention to increase investment in the U.S. R&D center, can it be further elaborated? Will the U.S. move to GDR funds? The U.S. is the highest HPC investment company, HPC the most important market, most of our HPC customers are also in the U.S.

We are expanding our R&D and business teams in the U.S. to better serve our customers in the U.S. This part does use GDR. Next question, do you know the company's progress in working with other memory generation plants? Well, this question is answered by me. I have some memory generation plants in progress, our economic progress, and the specific details are not yet available for further disclosure. Next question, the UHF RFID tag IC working with startups is expected to be mass-produced this year.

Is there a market in China? This is what I am going to tell you now, the development of UHF RFID has changed, and we are still expecting mass production this year. The market is global, not just China. The next question, the previous law will say that the company is focusing on the design of AI HPC mass production products, if it is smooth, if there is a chance to complete the first AI HPC product design this year, what is the progress?

I just mentioned in the report that UHF's AI HPC mass production products are currently having some design discussions, so we expect to have an event planned for this year, and then start execution. The progress seems to be smooth. Next question, at the shareholders' meeting, Mr. Chen mentioned that the Interposure products applied to the 2. 5G advanced packaging process are not available at the moment, so what is the cost of this year's revenue contribution to the company?

What are the areas for successful development? What are the areas of cooperation and cooperation that are still planned and discussed in this discussion? The field of application is related to the PMIC of VHM applications. Next question, the three products of the company are getting better performance, and the current visibility can grow by season in the next three quarters, can you ask the AI business unit at the current stage of the course, can you be ready to describe them using the start point of the course?

The next question, please note that the current VHM miner is mainly used to contribute limited to the revenue of Ethereum Classic coins.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's transcription and sort it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will look at the transcription fragments provided and note that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine these chronologically arranged sentences into consecutive paragraphs while maintaining the order and content of the original sentence.

For example, questions and answers about the Bitcoin mining machine planning should be linked together, while questions and answers about the VHM capacity need to be grouped. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural. During the processing process, you may encounter repeated questions such as, "What is the capacity of the VHM memory?" twice, and "Is it possible to tell the capacity required for each target market" three times. According to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so it is necessary to keep these duplicate sentences in paragraphs, which may be separated by the appropriate punctuation or line, to maintain readability.

Also, pay attention to the consistency of sentences. For example, the answer section may be composed of sentences with multiple timestamps that need to be merged into a smooth paragraph. For example, the answer to VHM capacity involves sentences with multiple timestamps that need to be arranged in order and connected with the appropriate punctuation, such as periods or semicolons, but the user requests do not rewrite, so line breaks or paragraph separators may be used.

Is there a plan for the company to develop mainstream currency mining machines such as Bitcoin? Let me explain to you. This is mainly an algorithmic difference. Bitcoin does not use memory, so we have no way to solve this problem. What is the capacity of the VHM memory? What is the capacity of the VHM memory?

Can you tell me about the capacity required for each target market? The capacity of the VHM can be up to dozens of Gigabytes. Can you tell me about the capacity required for each target market? Let me tell you about the capacity required for each target market. The capacity of the VHM can be large, up to dozens of Gigabytes.

The requirements we present to our customers are probably in this range as well, so the requirements we present to our customers are probably in this range. There are currently no VHMs for Gigabytes larger than this, and there are currently no VHMs for Gigabytes larger than this. So this is what our customers ask for, so we want to do it. Thank you for your advance questions.

Thank you for your continued support. Today's session is over.
