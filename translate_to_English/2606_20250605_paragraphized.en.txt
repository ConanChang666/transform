<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I will check the verbatim content provided.

You may want to combine these duplicated parts into paragraphs, but according to the rules, you cannot delete anything, so you need to keep all duplicated sentences in chronological order and arrange them into paragraphs. I need to process them on a regular basis to ensure that each sentence is kept in the final paragraph. For example, several timestamps at the beginning are "mirror and dot column", and you may need to merge them into a paragraph, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep them all. However, the user may want to combine these duplicated titles, but according to the rules, can not be deleted, so they can only be arranged as they are.

For example, from "12.6 years old about half-and-half" to analysis of China and India's economic growth, to specific data and forecasts, it is necessary to maintain the original order. It is important to note that there are overlapping or very close periods between timestamps, such as [307. 88-309. 32] and [309. 32-319. 48], which may mean that the same sentence is split into multiple parts and needs to be merged into a complete sentence. However, according to the original data provided by the user, each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence, so it must be independent. During the process, it is also important to pay attention to the correctness of punctuation and format, such as quotation marks, commas, sentences, etc., to ensure that the converted paragraphs are consistent with Chinese typography.

For example, combining multiple "mirror and dot column" entries into a paragraph, but each entry is individually listed and remains the same. After completing the initial draft, I will check again whether all the sentences are converted correctly, no omissions or errors, and ensure that the format is correct, in line with the user's requirements. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but according to the rules provided by the user, the following paragraph verbs are strictly followed without any modification.

[120. 00-149. 98] Mirror and Dot column. [150. 00-179. 98] Mirror and Dot column. [180. 00-209. 98] Mirror and Dot column. [210. 00-239. 22] Mirror and Dot column. [240. 00-269. 98] Mirror and Dot column. [270. 00-299. 98] Mirror and Dot column.

[336. 12-339. 20] In many cases, it is about 94% of the traffickers. [339. 46-341. 24] is a so-called energy-saving transmission. [341. 50-344. 58] The relative market is only 38%.

[345. 08-346. 10] That man also. [346. 36-352. 00] utilises only one of the fleet's energy-saving and innovative advantages to continue to create some. [352. 26-355. 84] The condition of a whole rental that is higher than the market. [357. 88-358. 40] Therefore, a operational strategy of an operator is in addition to the long-term. [362. 50-365. 82]

[366. 08-368. 12] Through the contract of goods. [369. 40-371. 46] A combination of the conveyance of the lease. [371. 72-373. 24] Add the goods. [373. 76-374. 78] A model of arbitrage. [375. 04-377. 60] To create a higher operational efficiency. [377. 86-379. 64] From the past years.

[379. 90-384. 52] Whether free or rent spread its overall operating performance. [385. 02-388. 36] is at least more than an average rent reported by the market. [388. 66-390. 44] More than 20% of one. [390. 70-391. 48] This portion also represents the operational team used it in the past. [391. 98-396. 08] This part also represents the operational efficiency of the fleet. [396. 34-399. 16]

[399. 92-404. 02] This relationship was created with some of the main customers. [404. 28-406. 58] Better operational efficiency than the market. [408. 62-410. 16] Next. [411. 18-41.2. 20] One of the future. [412. 46-415. 02] A company's development strategy apart from shipping. [415. 28-418. 36] The period of bulk shipping.

[418. 66-419. 94] Innovation comes. [420. 20-421. 48] This energy saving and carbon reduction. [421. 72-426. 08] That diversification investment is a plan for our future. [426. 60-427.1. 10] We are. [427. 36-428. 64] Except at. [428. 90-431. 20] Two years ago was the first batch of Taiwan.

[431. 46-435. 30] The investment operation is one that is driven by natural gas. [435. 56-436. 32] The diffuser fleet. [436. 84-437. 60] Outside of the company. [437. 86-439. 90] We are also in this year. [440. 16-441. 70] This is also us. [442. 20-442. 72]

[442. 98-444. 00] Large size. [444. 26-446. 56] The installation of the mined sand boat called rotor sail. [446. 82-447. 58] rotor sail [447. 84-448. 36] This should be. [448. 66-451. 22] It should also be used for wind protection. [451. 48-456. 34] The power of the ship is expected to reduce the entire voyage. [456. 60-459. 16] More than 5% of fuel consumption.

[459. 40-462. 48] That is also one of the main drivers of operational efficiency in the future. [462. 74-464. 78] The main drivers of operational efficiency. [465. 04-468. 36] That plus one of our diverse investments is currently also planned. [468. 62-469. 40] We are planning a large-scale investment in LNG carrier.

[477. 58-478. 36] Sport [478. 66-480. 70] A market for our Taiwan wind power operation. [481. 22-482. 76] This is our future. [483. 00-488. 90] mainly directed towards some of the 10 million tonnes of the main polygons of the ships. [489. 16-489. 92] This. [490. 18-492. 22] An expansion of our business scope. [495. 30-498. 62] Next report on the bulk.

[498. 88-502. 46] An overview of the market in the second half of this year and in the future. [503. 74-507. 58] The bulk is still largely influenced by the global economy. [507. 84-509. 12] The growth of the global economy. [509. 38-514. 24] The global economy this year was influenced by a lot of uncertainties. [514. 50-517. 30] That disrupted the overall bulk logistics supply chain. [517. 82-518. 34]

[518. 84-523. 96] The National Monetary Organization also revised this year's global growth rate in April. [524. 22-525. 76] The entire economy is a growth rate. [526. 02-530. 62] It is currently estimated that the global economic growth rate is only 2.8%. [530. 88-5332. 66] In 2020, it is estimated that there is only one growth of 3%. [535. 48-537. 54] It is one of the major growth.

[537. 84-540. 14] Source is still from emerging markets. [540. 40-546. 54] One of the two most important markets for bulking China and India China is estimated to be currently estimated. [546. 80-549. 86] One growth rate this year is about 4%. [550. 38-555. 24] India maintains an economic growth rate of about 6% or more. [555. 50-556. 52] The two. [556. 78-559. 34] These two places are the whole bulk.

[560. 10-562. 66] One of the most important markets in the current volume of trade. [565. 74-567. 54] Next report this year. [567. 84-569. 88] A situation in the first quarter of China. [570. 14-574. 24] A base region growth in China is about 5.4%. [574. 74-580. 64] This is better than an estimate of a market's operation, mainly because of a strong growth in exports. [581. 14-581. 66] Q1 [581. 92-584. 22] Overall GDP growth.

[584. 74-586. 78] That's what we need to pay attention to. [587. 04-589. 08] For bulk material needs. [589. 34-592. 16] or from infrastructure and this real estate. [592. 66-597. 54] The area of a real estate start-up is still decreasing compared to last year YO. [597. 84-599. 12] That's the case. A better phenomenon is that a part of industrial growth has resumed.

[604. 50-610. 12] That number currently looks like it has been one since June 2021. [610. 38-612. 18] The most powerful growth. [613. 96-615. 50] Based on market reviews. [617. 30-619. 08] An economic growth in China. [619. 34-624. 72] An increase of 1% per 1% may increase the trading volume of a bulk by 0.5%. [624. 98-626. 00] This section.

[626. 50-627. 02] Approx. [627. 58-6332. 18] is a growth pair that China has accumulated in this market. [63. 44-634. 50] The volume of bulk goods is very important. [637. 30-642. 18] A situation in which the import volume of the main raw materials of the low-dose China. [642. 68-645. 76] We can see that the main raw materials include iron ore. [646. 02-647. 30] Coal.

[647. 54-648. 58] The portion of the building. [648. 82-653. 70] Even the portion of the steel is still lower than the same period last year. [654. 98-657. 02] One import is mainly ordinarily this. [657. 58-664. 24] The condition of de-stocking plus a high point in the portside stock. [664. 74-669. 86] The import part of the coal is mainly due to the production of one country in the whole of China. [670. 12-672. 18] Maintains relatively high-end.

[672. 42-675. 24] The demand for imports is relatively high. [675. 76-676. 78] It is so high. [677. 04-679. 86] It also affects the volume of imports throughout the first quarter. [681. 14-687. 28] The only thing to note is whether the imports of an imported milkshake for the entire aluminum sands continue to remain high. [687. 58-688. 86] That currently looks like the first quarter of this year. [689. 12-691. 16]

[691. 68-692. 96] 1 to April. [693. 22-693. 98] or [694. 50-695. 26] was substantially completed. [695. 78-697. 06] More than 34%. [702. 18-

This is the first time that a major demand for iron ore of the future is expected to increase with a continuous increase in supply of the whole long waterway. The demand for iron ore of the future is expected to increase with a continuous increase in supply of the whole long waterway. The demand for iron ore of the future is likely to be seen on the left. The demand for iron ore of the future is expected to increase with a major increase in demand for the future. The demand for iron ore of the future is expected to increase by about 1.5 million tons in the future, and the demand for the entire iron ore of the future is expected to increase by 150,000 tons in the future. In China, China's most aggressive shift to buy a whole grain from Brazil, soybeans, Brazil's grains, a cat, now looks like the whole growing Brazil to China and the United States to China will be roughly the same as Brazil, the United States about 10% of that sailing distance will increase by about 4 to 5 days. This part will absorb a part of the capacity of a small and medium-sized ship, the main source of growth is probably from the entire terrestrial mine. We can see that the main growth of iron ore coal in the first quarter of this year is a negative growth condition, or from the entire terrestrial mine, or from the steel. It is a very low number of growth of the main ship type that we can see that the current bulking of the new ship order rate is only about 10% of the current operation of the 14000 new fleet of operations of the new ship can only reach more than 10% of the more than 1000 of the new ship orders, which is only about 8% of the small and medium-sized ships are relatively high, but also about 11% to 13% of the growth in the coming years should be limited to the entire main current price of some of the factors as well as the energy of this marine fuel transformation, and then coupled with the future of the pollution of the ship one factor that will inhibit the future of the bulking of the supply of the main supply side or the number of ships in the current market due to the relatively low situation of the whole market.

This year, the average number of ships for the entire bulk is probably below this section, which is about 6% less than last year's 20 to 10 years ago. In addition, the old ship part, which currently accounts for about 23% of the old ships over the age of 16, which will slowly become a so-called head-mounted target by regulatory factors or operating costs in the future. Some of the supply should be balanced in the coming years. Next, let's talk about some of the recent developments in the U.S. regulations for the shipping industry.

Many people think that exemptions, including if an empty ship is in the United States shipping, currency is an exemption, which is less than 80,000 tonnes, and that short voyage if a short voyage is a short voyage of the whole transport is also an exemption. The name of the ship is more than 80,000 tonnes, but basically the channel type is not to be shipped or unloaded in the United States, and some large Permes is basically not to be shipped to the United States, and basically the name of a business fleet, this U.S. trade represents a very limited amount of China-class ship operating. The other tariff factors for the trade of raw materials of bulk trade, see that bulk raw materials trade in the United States accounted for a very small trade, about 8%, the imports are only 3%, and most of grains are about 5%.

In the last few days, the BTI has slowly rebounded, affected by the demand of some markets, and about 4% less than the same period last year. The BTI index of yesterday was about 1489 points, and the market has entered the trend of rebound slowly. The first five months of the ship's index, about 39% less than the same period last year, and the small and medium-sized ships, about 30% less to the production market, but the market is just reporting the recent market rebound mainly because of the Australian miners checkout factor in June, driving this channel shipment, plus Brazil's overall climate situation is good, the most recent shipment is also higher than the average, so it has driven the demand for the entire channel type of transport.

Some of the factors that are likely to drive the price of the market, including the whole supply side, are very limited, and some of the factors that are expected to lead to the entire dissemination of some of the regulations are expected in 2028, and the entire International Maritime Organization in October this year will probably set out the entire dissemination of some of the regulations, which will probably increase the burden of this carbon tax, which may accelerate the dissemination of the old. Some of the whole of the new grains, including the needs of West Africa and other new markets, the demand for electric vehicles for yogurt mining, is a factor that will benefit the whole second half and the future. Of course, some of the policy transformation of tariffs in China, some of the entire real estate, or a demand for the whole steel collective mineral sand.

The above is probably a summary of today's report, so if you have any questions, welcome to ask, thank you. I would like to ask you if this is because the strength of aluminum mine is relatively large, I think you do not have the ability to raise the price alone, that is, you can not share the price alone. The second part of this piece, if the sum of our company's revenue is probably two sources, that is, as with iron ore, the main aluminum ore trade is Guinea to China, and the main Brazilian to China, Australia to China.

We have an entire exporter of the long-term leased vessel for an aluminum mine in West Africa. The Nabma Polar type is also a trader who leases the entire aluminum mine. A trader of the aluminum mine is a trader who leases the entire aluminum mine. Therefore, it is still relatively less relative to the main raw materials of aluminum soil.

As coal trade volume of 1.3 billion tonnes of grain trade volume is relatively small, it is probably about 4% of the world's trade volume of 57 billion tonnes of tonnes. So it is likely that the revenue ratio is very close to this number because the main revenue is mainly from this channel or mainly from this channel.

Because his demand is relatively stable, it is not as stable as coal or as some of the effects of some of the entire energy transition. The China, along with this year's China's production of one of the production of coal, also relatively affects the whole due to the small and medium-sized ship if it is caused by a trade demand for coal. This is a general idea of what is most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be most likely to be the least likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the least likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely to be the most likely is most or most or most or most or most or most or almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost or or or almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost all be the most or or or or or almost almost almost almost almost all or almost all or almost all or almost all or almost all or almost almost almost all or almost almost almost almost all or almost all or almost almost almost all or almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost all is most obvious.

It is possible to say that the loss of the industry is mainly a loss of the rate of evaluation of financial products, we have to invest some of this, because the overseas companies because they are the U.S. dividends, there are some funds that have invested in this U.S. stock market overseas, and received an impact of the entire change in the first quarter, so it is likely that the first quarter of the financial report has been affected by some, but in April the market has been reintroduced, this part of the loss has been slowly reduced, and now it seems that the second quarter of the number should be a positive number, there will not be this loss.
