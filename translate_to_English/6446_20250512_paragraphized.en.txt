<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and organize it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original. Next, I need to analyze the fragments of the verbatim that are provided to see how to combine these time-stamped sentences into consecutive paragraphs.

First of all, I will check the corresponding sentences for each timestamp in order to determine the logical relationship between them. For example, the greetings at the beginning and the introduction of the guest part should be merged into a natural paragraph. Then, the presentation of the financial section may need to be divided into several paragraphs, each paragraph revolves around a topic, such as revenue growth, expense control, R&D investment, etc. It is important to note that some sentences may have jumps in timestamps, such as the missing part in the middle, but the user does not provide those parts, so it is necessary to strictly follow the sentences provided. At the same time, to ensure that the correct sequence of sentences within each paragraph do not disrupt the original sequence of time and logical structure.

In addition, the user mentioned the phrase "permanently verbatim" may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence and needs to combine these sentences into a longer paragraph based on the context. For example, the part of the introducer may have multiple timestamps, but it is actually a continuous introduction that should be merged into a paragraph. During the process, also pay attention to the use of punctuation marks and verbs to make the paragraphs smoother. For example, use "next", "after" and other transitional words to connect different parts. At the same time, maintain the accuracy of professional terms, such as company name, job name, etc., to ensure that there are no spelling errors.

[30. 00-32. 40] Next is the CEO of Lin Guozhong Lin. [32. 40-38. 00] Next is the manager of Huang Zhengu Huang. [38. 00-42. 40] Now is the three manpower 0. [42. 40-46. 40] Next is the deputy director of Tsai Guanyu Tsai. [46. 40-51. 40] Our former director of wood. [51. 40-56. 80] Next, we gave the time to two people for today's investment visit. Thank you.

[56. 80-59. 00]. [60. 00-77. 20] Thank you for today's strength. [77. 20-81. 00] I'm Joanne from the pharmacology investor relations department and I'm happy to introduce you to the people's visual growth and future prospects here. [81. 00-84. 40] First of all, I'd like to ask Henry to introduce our situation to you. [89. 90-92. 90]

[113. 90-117. 90] It is likely that the first quarter will be around 3.5%. [119. 90-121. 90] This is the breakthrough since 2013. [121. 90-122. 90] We can see that because of our highly integrated business model, we have our own manufacturing capabilities, and a leadership team with practical experience in R&D and commercialization, to demonstrate such excellent market realization and operational resilience. [124. 90-137. 90] That is, we have 5K experience in Taipei and Taiwan, as well as our Boston and Tokyo Salt, Beggie Subsidary. [143. 90-151. 90] Will Establish.

[153. 90-154. 90] This is our partner, and I will introduce you to our Pink Partner in London, America The Coverage and Forest. [156. 90-162. 90] Our new partner is in Canada, and we will work together to expand the side office of a larger state-owned company. [164. 90-168. 90] Next, I will give Gary a report on our next financial situation. [171. 90-173. 90] Next, I will tell you the results of our operations in the first quarter of 2005, and we can see that our revenue in the first quarter of 2005 was 32.57 billion yuan, with 8 consecutive quarters continuing growth, creating a new high, which exceeded a trend in our past. [179. 90-187. 90] We can see that we have a relatively stable state in the first quarter of the first quarter of the year, but this year we are breaking this trend.

[196. 90-200. 90]. Then we can see that our first quarter revenue is almost doubled and YY is 97%. [205. 90-209. 90] But at the same time, our revenue is a very zero state of control, and YY is only 24%. [214. 90-217. 90] The part of our research and development that we have continued to invest in is the amount of our research and development.

[236. 90-241. 90] Our post-tax Jinli was in the first quarter of 12.6 billion yuan, which was a double-shooting new high. [247. 90-249. 90] The last time we saw the portion of our quarter EPS, our first quarter, our first quarter, we reached 3.8 billion yuan, and it was a new high in our history. [256. 90-258. 90] That was the result of our financial operations in the first quarter. [260. 90-262. 90] Then we returned to nine other women to discuss our business status. [264. 90-266. 90] Then I would like to introduce to you the company profile of our global layout, and you know that we have already obtained a drug pass in Japan, the last year, and more than 40 countries have been approved to be listed.

[279. 90-284. 90] The global market is still expanding and we expect it to be available soon in Argentina as well. [293. 90-295. 90] We hope that patients in more regions will benefit from ROCAC treatment as soon as possible. [297. 90-302. 90] As more countries complete the review, the scale of our ROCAC's global consumption is growing rapidly, mainly due to its natural ability to index modifiers and tight controls, which is why our market is so fast-paced. [315. 90-323. 90] Then the acceptance of doctors and patients is a few-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step-step

In Brazil, there are two billion people in Brazil, and Brazil is actually a very important market for us, and that size is what we were invited to this camp in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and its size and focus is the annual meeting of the Asco Convention in the United States, which attracted thousands of global experts and experts from the leading opinion show to participate in this event. [347. 90-356. 90] The event is a very important milestone, that our ROPEC successfully listed in Brazil. [361. 90-364. 90] In the conference, you can see that this is Dr. Reeves, who is our KOL in the United States, and he was invited to speak at our SEAR conference. [368. 90-371. 90]. His speech is about ROPEC in the treatment of real red hemoglobulence syndrome we will refer to PB, and he is a clinical value, especially emphasized as a disease-modedulated treatment in the conference, which is not only to ROPEC. This is a highly highly highly a demonstration of ROPEC, which is a demonstration of ROPEC, which is not only that we are not only, but also a manifestation of ROPEC, which is a highly positive positive for ROPEC, which is a demonstration of ROPEC.

That said, we already have a good global boom, we will go back to what we call COVERED, so in addition to our continuous boom ET Essential Convexin Phenia is the original red platelets syndrome, as well as this early primal fiber emulsion called Early PNF Primary Vital of Phytosis, our further boom from PB ET and PNF can all be boomed to such a group of patients. [417. 90-439. 90] In the ET group of patients, the EARLY PNF is about 1.4 million, and in fact, the scale shows that we are very large in the future of indications, so we also have a lot of confidence in the next growth. [444. 90-459. 90].

According to this guide. The first line of treatment for high-risk patients, such as Pytoptheluria. In fact, there are many limitations. Because many patients have long-term use, antibiotic resistance or unbearable, or even toxic reactions.

There is no way to really change the course of the course, or to achieve a mutation gene complex such as Receive Modify, reduce JAK2 genes, and so on. Let's take a look at the importance of refresh to JAK2 Mutant allele burden, increasing reduction. Overall, there are many medical needs that are not yet met in the field of medical devices.

So that's why we wanted to use Low-PAC, an important tool for BIMIA at Presensio Compos, to make sure the address is clear. We completed a Global Phase III trial of Surpass-ET and we expect to apply for an anti-regulation application by 2025. In addition, we have been actively promoting the Global Clinical Trial of Early TMS, and then there is an adult T-cell leukemia, which we call ATL. These advances not only contribute to expanding the market potential of Low-PAC, but also to further strengthening the position of promoting the MPN to other blood mainstream therapeutic areas.

We use a fast delivery dose design, which is raised to 350 Î¼g from 250 two weeks to the fourth week. This design is designed to ensure effectiveness while also taking into account the patient's tolerance for medication convenience. Next, I will report to you, and Go through the results we have seen. In fact, this kind of indicator is very Compelling, why? Because we have seen in this area of ET, compared with many other drugs, only Low-PAC has a way to overcome the major data in this comparison.

Back to the main effect, Low-PAC can be seen in the trial, from its Statistic ratio, more Superior than the Enagolife, from 9% to 6%, so we can see that our efficacy is far superior to it. It can be achieved from 9 months to 12 months, at the bottom of this complete hematology treatment. In this table, we can see that most of us can see the JAK2 equivalent genomic burden, and see the situation. The Base Size 0 is based on the patient's own gene mutation, his performance. The yellow layer on the right is our Row-PAC, which is the significant reduction of his gene mutations, and all the reduction of all the patients are our Row-PAC.

So you can see that our Row-PAC, or the one that really has the effect of Exist-Modify. Because all aspects of GiA are connected, showing the excellent performance of Enagolife, has attracted the attention of the international medical community. Such results have been won our American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which is a big event in the world, and then it is also a lot of Oncology-related Abstracts, with some clinical drugs, who want to contribute, and then want to be favored by us. Our results are based on the Based Health of ASCO, and then an Oral presentation in this ASCO.

In addition to the high risk of ET, Surface ET was introduced in the U.S., we also conducted this mono-arm experiment, complete CET, called HTT. It was mainly aimed at treating ET patients at all risk levels, and we were involved in the study, no matter how close they were to treatment experience. So this Surface ET helped us to promote this Roll Type, build first-line therapy, and build solid clinical and scientific information with the second-line all. Compile these two data, we will send to NPA for review, then get Proof of, and we expect to send this Dimension this year.

Here we can see that we are the same with the rapid incremental dosage program and design, 250 then 350 and 100, and then we will be in our PMS trial. So we are now very active and in progress. Just looking back at the ET and PMS, we are all in the process of using the rapid dose increase program and strategy.

In Europe, Proof of Use was used to compare the dose increase in Conventional. We believe that the efficiency of such a fast-dose increase can help patients improve their efficacy, and then reach his CHR faster, and then continue to be successful, we began to carry out such a clinical study. Then you can see that China and Japan are 61.2% in the 24th week, compared to the 31.2% in the 24th week of Proof of, and then in Japan it is 57.1% in the 31.2%. In addition to the rapid introduction of the new product, we will hold a large conference in Chicago from June 9th to 11th to help our marketing and medical team to understand the characteristics of this product and the mode of use, we can strengthen our communication with the patients of clinicians, improve the acceptance of this product and patient coverage, you can see the test, we have a new test, doctor will enter, the injection will also, so that we can meet a large marketing team to contact with the patients of the new product, we have a large number of patients with the new product, we have a large number of patients with the new product, we have to do with the new product development of the new product, we have a large number of ADS, we have to do with the new product, we have a large number of patients to do with the new marketing team, we have to see the new product, we have a new product, we have to do with the new product, we have a new product development team, we have to see the new product, we have a new product, we have to do with the new product, we have a new product, we have to do with the new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have to do with the new development, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have to see the new product, we have a new product, we have a new development of the new product, we have a new development team, we have a new product, we have a new team, we have a new team, we have a new product, we have a new team, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new team, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new development, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new development, we have a new comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive development, we have a new product, we have a new management team, we have a new team, we have a new management team, we have a new product, we have to see the . In the construction, next year, we can immediately adopt, which can be started, after our two plants, we can support more than 1% of the absolute drug needs of patients, so we have seen that the market can be expanded, the market should be tested, and then the introduction of PenDevice, will be in response to such a market, our marketing team has also built up, production capacity has been pre-deployed, so we have expected a new growth power, and then we want to take the next step in addition to the RO-PAC, it in the oncology immune strength, we have to mention that it is Compine, Anti-PD-1 and other clinical experiments, we also carry on, then we actively use our own patented Pegulation technology platform, develop a new generation of long-effective biopharmacology, focus on blood tumors, solid tumors and immunocom.

In addition to the ongoing clinical trials with RO-PAC combined with other immunosuppressants, we also have several IATs in progress. These IATs are very important to us because once we see the clinical results in IAT, we have the opportunity to turn this result into our future, we can go to market, we will have more information in the future, so we have to provide more information, because we have the opportunity to come from our label, this is our, this is our, this list, we can use vision certificate.

Since Ropac approved for PB, we have continued to advance the clinical leadership of ET and PMF, because ET will also be sending applications to the United States this year to expand their indications and strengthen their position as a global MPN standard treatment. Second, we are going to expand Ropac to other blood and physical tumor indications, and this time we have to explore Ropac, just as I have reported with you, and we will continue to expand its therapeutic potential in a new phase of clinical development. Third, we will use our own Pipe Modifier brand to develop long-acting treatments for cytomy tumors, called frequency therapy, for menâs cancer and immune disease, and we are developing innovative therapies such as long-acted Infra-Uterine Pulse II, further demonstrating the technological development, scalability and multi-product potential of our platform.

We have a lot of protein engineering and antibodies development platform, we can do well, and then governance and research and development of high affinity and highly selective innovative biologics, so that the treatment more precise. At the same time, we have also introduced AI-assisted drug design and high-throughput screening to accelerate the development of bispecific antibodies, we are in the development of four percent of the development of synthetic biology-related therapies. Of course, we are also leading the development of a so-called cell-based fusion protein called Intelucon-Immune Cytomax, which combines the various types of antibodies, which can be associated with cell-based immune activation, enhances the effectiveness, and also aims to significantly reduce the toxicity of the system and demonstrate strong therapeutic capabilities.

At present, we have been optimistic about PBET and Global approval, followed by the progress of our next clinical progress, and other new R&D production lines that have been developed in R&D. We have solid conditions to continue to promote document growth and create long-term value. Thank you.
