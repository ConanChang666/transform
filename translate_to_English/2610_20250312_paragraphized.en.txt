We welcome you to participate in the First Quarter Industrial Investment Forum held by Sino-Air Securities. Today, we are pleased to invite you to hold the first session of 2025.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to today's Chief Executive: First of all, the Chief Financial Officer; second of all, Mr. Sze Xia; and third of all, the Manager. First of all, we would like to invite the Director to speak to us briefly, and then the Manager would like to give a brief explanation. Thank you. Thank you for all the advances in investing. We would also like to thank you for inviting us to this forum. Today we would like to tell you that we have a lot of success in China Airlines and our future development strategy.

2024 is a very fruitful year. We all know that since the beginning of the pandemic, due to the technology shutdown, we are all focused on the freight, and then the freight is slowly recovering after the pandemic, so we put the center in the passenger, and then 2023 and 2024 we will take the passenger in.

In addition, in order to increase the volume of the North American market, we also opened many night flights in Southeast Asia, mainly the hope of expanding the business opportunities of connecting passengers. This mode of operation, we will continue to do so again in 2025. We also pay attention to the international situation, so this year we have set up a flight to Canada in advance, and that is to focus on expanding the North American market.

That's why we're so proud of the fact that there's so much about ESG, and that's why we're so proud of some of the other things we do in ESG, and that's why we're so proud of the fact that there's so much about it that we're doing a lot more about the new ESG. That's why we're going to have a more detailed explanation in our presentation here. Thank you for joining us today, and then I'm going to ask our manager to make a note of that.

The first part is the operational timing of 2024. The second part is the introduction of the industrial environment and market temperature, and the next part is the group plan, and then the company's sustainability and distribution, and finally the company's sustainability and distribution. First, see the company's business performance in 2024. The combined revenue in 2024 was about 10.3%, compared to 2023. The net operating profit after considering the operating costs was about $18.82 billion, while the combined net profit grew by 79.2% in 2023. If the company's net profit is 154.900 million, the net profit belongs to the parent company's net profit is also part of China Airlines's net profit, while the net profit belongs to the parent's net profit is also part of China Airlines and the net profit is part of China Airlines.

The next page we have summarized some of the company's finance ratio from pre-pandemic to the end of last year. That first saw the flow ratio, then first saw the flow ratio. The flow ratio was about 68 in 2019, but with the steady profit of the company, by the end of 2024, our company's turnover ratio has risen to 109, which was more than 100% after the first outbreak. The same debt ratio also continued to decline from about 79% before the pre-pandemic, that is, until the end of 2024, so the financial ratio has been continuously improved, so the company's financial situation is becoming more and more stable.

This picture on the right shows that if we look at the division, it is the highest in Northeast Asia, followed by 11% in Southeast Asia, and the other parts like the US and Europe have 8% of the long line, and the mainland China also has a 5% revenue growth. Then let's talk about the cost of the changes. We first see the 2024 part, that 2024 cost is the highest or the oil part, which is 32%, although it is 3% less than 2023, the main reason for the decline in oil prices.

That first saw that 2024, the price of long oil was about 96.6% per barrel, and that was a 9% decrease compared to 2023, but because of the recovery of energy, the number of barrels was reached, a year of 1552 million barrels, which, after the same year increased by 3%, then multiplied the price, and then considered the oil avoidance, the cost of fuel in 2024 was about 515 billion, which was reduced by about 4% compared to 2023. Now, let's look at now, let's look at now, let's look at that, we are finishing up the same from the epidemic, 19 years before the pandemic to 25 years is some oil price trends, let's tell you all. The red line above, this is the part of the oil, then the blue line is the part of Brent crude oil, below we will always care about the difference between the oil and the price of crude oil and crude oil.

That was like yesterday's oil price. Yesterday's closing price. Like Brent crude oil at the time of February was also collected at 72.8. That day it actually fell about 69. 5. A barrel of 69. 5. That's the part of the oil.

At the end of February, about 88 pieces were collected. That day, it had dropped to about 83 pieces. Then, let's talk about the two spreads. CRACK part. That blue oil is currently the price difference with the crude oil. It is also likely to remain in the barrel for $15 per barrel.

It is the latest forecast of February 11. It is the forecast of Brent crude oil. It is the 24 year it is the release of 81 pieces. That 25 year it is the release of 74 pieces. 26 years it is estimated that the lower is $66 per barrel.

That's why the entire oil price is a downward trend. In fact, it's a big help to airlines to reduce its costs. The next page we'll do a little bit for the first part. That's what we've mentioned before. China Airlines has hit a record high in revenue in 2020.

In fact, it is part of revenue. China Airlines is either consolidated or individual revenues. They are all growing year after year. EPS has also increased year after year since 2022. The company's overall financial situation has continued to improve. And that's why.

China Airlines has received a CHT rating since 2001. This is the first time we received a CHT rating last year. We have upgraded our long-term credit rating to TWA-MI.

It is more effective to reduce financing costs. Therefore, the company's financial position is very stable. Then, into the second part. The industrial sports environment and market outlook. That's because the global climate is closely related to the industry of air passenger transport.

It released the latest one in January. Forecast for global and major economic levels of GDP. IMF in this report. It first raised the US GDP growth in 2025 this year. From the original 2.2 to 2.7. That part of Taiwan.

Because IMF is not updated in January, we are part of the Chinese Academy of Economics. The Taiwan part is expected to grow by 2.7 in 2025. That 2026 is 3.0. Then go back to the IMF report.

IMF is mentioned in it. Because of the rise in U.S. growth. Offsets other major economic levels downward. So, the global GDP forecast. IMF is in its latest announcement. In 2025, it increased slightly from the original 3.2 to 3.3.

And then in this report. It also adds 26 years of forecasts to 3. 3. Then the report also mentions. Although the economic growth of 25 26 3.3 is less than pre-pandemic. The pre-pandemic period is from 2020 to 2019.

The report mentioned it. Although it is not the same as this 3.7. But it is expected to be next year. It is still stable growth. Then because of the uncertainty of U.S. tariff detection, there are actually some fluctuations in the market.

We will keep an eye on IMF. Or other international institutions. Like World Bank. Forecast on global climates. Here's the briefing. We've compiled an IMF forecast for the 2025 industry.

IMF is a trend chart for global aviation revenues in 2025. IMF is a forecast for global aviation revenues in 2025. It will reach $1 trillion. It will then grow to 4.4% in a year.

Although the global passenger growth is slowing, it is in Asia Pacific or Oceania. Oceania is growing. It is still 11.5% and 8.2%. It shows that Asia Pacific is the main global growth energies. That is the most right part.

Part of Taiwan is also predicted. This year's passenger volume has grown by 11.3%. The next page is about the global and Taoyuan freight market. That's because the global climate is closely related to the industry of air passenger transportation.

It released the latest one in January. Global and major economic levels of GDP forecast. IMF in this report. It first raised the US GDP growth for 25 years this year. From the original 2.2 to 2.7. That part of Taiwan.

Because IMF is not updated in January. We are part of the Chinese Academy of Economics. That is part of Taiwan. Economic growth is expected to be 2.7 in 2025. Then we return to the IMF report.

It is also mentioned in the report. Although the economic growth of 25 26 3.3 is less than pre-pandemic. The pre-pandemic period is from 2020 to 2019. About 3. 7.

It is expected that this year will be next year. Then, because of the uncertainty of U.S. tariff detection recently, the market actually has some volatility. We will continue to look at IMF. Or other international institutions, such as World Bank.

Forecast for the global climate. Here is a briefing. We have compiled the IMF. A forecast for the 2025 industry. IMF is a trend chart for global aviation revenues in 2025. IMF is a forecast for global aviation revenues in 2025.

It will reach $1 trillion. Then the growth can reach 4.4% year-on-year. Here is the chart below. Here is the reference. While the global passenger growth is slowing. But in the Asia Pacific region.

The Oceania region is growing. Still up to 11.5%. That is the far right part. Taiwan is also predicting. This year's passenger traffic growth is up to 11.3%. The next page is about it.

Global and Taoyuan freight markets. That is because the global climate is closely related to the industry of air passenger transport. That is why we have put together an IMF first. It is published in January. Global and major economic forecasts.

Global and major economic-grade forecasts. Taiwan's part. Because IMF is not updated in January. We are part of the Chinese Academy of Economics. Taiwan's part is estimated to be 2.7 in 2025.

IMF also added a 26-year forecast of 3.3. It was also mentioned in the report. Although the economic growth of 25 26 3.3 is not before the pandemic, it is expected that this year and next year. And then because of the uncertainty of U.S. tariff detection.

In fact, the market is fluctuating. Then we will keep an eye on IMF. Or other international institutions. Forecasts like World Bank on global climates. Here is the briefing. We have compiled the IMF.

A forecast for the 2025 industry. IMF is a trend chart for global aviation revenues in 2025. IMF is a forecast for global aviation revenues in 2025. It will reach $1 trillion.

That was mentioned here. Although global. But Asia Pacific. Still up to 11.5%. The portion of Taiwan. Economic growth is estimated to be 2.7 in 2025.

Then back to the IMF report. Although 25 26 3.3. 3 economy. Then report the same. Although 25 26 3.3. The Taiwan part. Economic growth is expected in 2025.

We are part of the Chinese Academy of Economics. Taiwan. Economic growth is expected to be 2.7 in 2025. Then back to IMF. Although 25 26 3.3 of the economy. Taiwan.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to the sentences corresponding to each timestamp. The example provided by the user, some sentences may be duplicated or incorrect, such as "estimated growth rate is 6 six six six", and I need to keep the same as usual without any modification. At the same time, pay attention to the connection between sentences to ensure that the paragraphs are smooth, but not to change the original intention. Next, I need to identify which sentences can be combined into paragraphs.

In the same way, about the part of the company's fleet planning, from "next to the third part of the company's ladder planning" to "total of 2424", these content belongs to the same theme and should be merged. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order. At the same time, the user mentioned "do not delete any sentence" is the key, so even if some sentences look redundant or duplicate, such as "expected second", it also needs to be retained as well.

In addition, pay attention to the oral expression, such as "uh", "that", "that", etc. Filled words, such as "that", "that", "that"," etc., cannot be omitted during the conversion, must be retained in the paragraph. For example, "that" and "that" in the "first to see the passenger passenger passenger section" are the original words, which need to be retained. In the process, some sentence structures or syntax errors may be encountered, but according to the user's request, can not be any rewritten, can only remain as it is. For example, "the words on the right side of the diagram may be "this picture", but the user requests not modify, so the original sentence must be preserved.

If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the original transcript again to ensure that the conversion is error-free. The picture on the left is the same as the volume of 19 to 24 years freight capacity and load changes. The first to see the red line below is that the actual freight volume is actually showing a downward trend in 22 years 23 years after the pandemic, and until last year it was going up, there was a new high, an annual increase of 11.3%.

This is because the economy mentioned above is mild and stable, but it is like geopolitical or Trump's tariff policy to add uncertainty to the market. Next to the third part of the company's ladder planning. Here is a summary of the number of eh to the first quarter of this year to the company's entire fleet. That first to see the passenger passenger section, the passenger part is like 7. 1% like 7. 8%7. 9% is expected to be introduced again in the fourth quarter, and then it will be reduced to 12, the 3. 2% will be handed over to the family in March, and then to the third house will be able to reach 19 by the end of the year.

Then we add this to the 7. 8%7. 9% and 7. 8%7. 9% and 10%, because we have a total of 9 and 10 total of 24, and then 7. 8%7. 9% is expected to start the delivery in the next 25 years, and then 2424 will be delivered in the next 29 years to 7. 8%7. 9% and 7. 8%7. 10% will have a total of 24. That, like the other part of A321NEO is expected to be able to complete the delivery to 19 by the end of the year, then we have a total of 25, which we expect to be able to deliver in 2026.

The first thing we see is the performance of the passenger in 2024, then the table on this side of 2024 has a comparison of 2024 and 23, then 24 and 19 with the epidemic. That first see 24 vs. 23, although the unit income has a slight decline, the operation has increased by 9.6%, and then the passenger passenger passenger passenger has a steady income growth of 8.4% throughout the year. That is, if the 24 years and the 19 years before the epidemic, although the operation and passenger rate of the passenger has not reached the epidemic, but because the unit revenue has increased by 27.5%, so the customer revenue has also increased by 11.7% compared to the pre-pandemic.

This is the first time we have seen this picture in the bottom left corner, we actually sell about 20% of our own channel sales before the epidemic, then the number of tickets sold all year round, but the company has the flexibility to use social media to create topics, and then the combined 14 tickets is our representative, such as the January 25th of this year, the February of this year, has reached 3. 18 February, there is 2.88 in fact, the unit revenue has been stable. Well, the following page wants to tell you that we are currently our own channel is online sales FIT, let you tell us that FIT is representative of individual tickets, along with another round of votes we use GIT representatives.

Five flights. Along with my original flight. So there are 12 flights to Tokyo from Kaohsiung to United States. That's in the May part. We have a roundtrip flight to Kagoshima. Then the flight to Kagoshima is included.

Then there is the Kumamoto. We are China Airlines the highest point in the Kyushu route industry. It was in July of 24 years. We had a double flight to Seattle. Then, there are five flights per week.

That is currently in the planning evaluation continue to increase. That part of the 25-year period is in February. uh, we first doubled the Kaohsiung Kumamoto. Then. The exclusive Taipei Kaohsiung doubled the entrance. That in March.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We have more than one group of people in San Francisco then this group is daily.

The next month. We'll be adding more flights to Okinawa, Kaohsiung. We've reached the current plan of 4 flights per week. Then, in the future, we'll continue to plan extra flights or re-route according to the market conditions. Then, we'll report to you on the strategy of passenger service operation.

First of all, let's talk about our robust development and layout. That's the future we will take advantage of the geographical location of Taiwan. The advantage of commanding with the company to strengthen the O.A.. Northeast Asia New Zealand. There are also connecting passengers between North America and Asia. Then take advantage of the need for different times.

Then uh revenue management. Raise the passengers and customers in all aspects. There's a little more here. We just mentioned it to the Director. That's why we're planning to travel to North and South East Asia. We're actually on a lot of night flights.

That's where the second night flight started last April. There are actually a lot of night flights. The current night flights include Bangkok. Singapore. Jakarta Manila Hong Kong has 5 destinations. That's exactly what we're planning for this year as well.

That's exactly what we're planning this year too. Increase flights to Southeast Asia night flight. We'll also take full advantage of our existing capacity. Scale our operations. Then measure market demand in a rolling fashion. There are policy changes as well.

Plan your flights positively. Open up new destinations. Then create maximum revenue. Then see the innovations that keep up with the times. That's in addition to the mention in this briefing. We'll drive customer relationship management.

Then continue to optimize the China Airlines website. Increase our direct sales ratio. Increase the proportion of direct sales. In fact, we are also uh in terms of uh hardware. Step-by-step uh enhancement. uh refers to our ongoing progress from the previous point.

The fleet is too old to introduce a new generation of aircraft. Like 7879 78710. There are 77-9 and 3501000.

We have also upgraded to 350 cabins. We offer new cabin facilities. Then we will see the cargo section. The cargo section is organized like 24 years and 23 years. Compared to the previous 2019, that first saw the 23 years.

24 years compared to 23 years. The 24 years are driven by the demand for AI phony servers. Or some cross-border e-commerce companies. This unit has reached 11.4. In fact, the same period of 23 years has grown around 7 o'clock.

7. 4 %. That's 41.3% more growth than before. So, while our operational strength is a slight decrease of 23 years.

Whether it is the same period last year or before the pandemic together, there are also significant growth. Here to supplement. Why we have a slight reduction in energy performance. Mainly because we are wrong to order 77F.

There will be a slight delay in delivery of the new freighter at the time. So it will result in a slight reduction in our operation and the volume part. The picture on the right is the same as that of our goods.

America and Canada Europe actually account for more than 7 percent of us. That's it. North America is part of the North American line. It's been more than 50 percent for a long time.

That next page we have summarized the unit revenue for the month of March. Along with the portion of revenue. That first saw the portion of revenue. It can be seen that it actually started in May last year. The revenue exceeded 5 billion. Then it remained 5.1 billion.

This trend is shown on the rise. The unit gains part of the same, from the second quarter.

The following is the result of a re-arranged paragraph-arranged transcription based on the transcription content provided: Then, just like China Airlines, in response to the Tianhe Alliance Flight Plan for three consecutive years, we added SAP fuel to our aircraft. Also, China Airlines has entered into a sustainable cooperation agreement with corporate customers such as China Trust or Redwood Global Transportation.

China Airlines has been awarded the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook for a number of years, and has also been awarded the Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award for a number of years. China Airlines, in fact, is a sustainable leader in Taiwan's aviation industry, in addition to adding SAP to our new aircraft, is also the first independent report on climate-related financial disclosure TCFD.

China Airlines will continue to improve its ESG management performance. The above is today's briefing. OK Thank you very much for the detailed explanation. Then, we will proceed to Q&A. The questions we have today are written questions, so if you have any questions, welcome to join us and I will send you the form.

Well, first of all, here's the first step in this investment to ask about the increase in the energy consumption of passenger freight in 2025, which is the increase in the energy consumption. So now we want to try to make adjustments to each of our flights, and then try to give us the opportunity to deliver as early as possible. That's why we expect our volume to grow to 3 to 4 percent, and that's what we'll continue to do this year.

The second part of the question is the investment advanced to say how much the proportion of passenger transit in the current proportion, that is, China Airlines here, we transfer this customer accounted for more than 20% of the overall, the European route accounted for about 30%, from Southeast Asia to North America, our main market, we now accounted for more than 50%, that is just what we have mentioned, we will continue to evaluate, such as Seattle, on the main flight in North America, and some of the night flights in Southeast Asia, and then to Taiwan, and then let them transfer to North America, this is the next focus of the market.

In addition, it is about the proportion of the proportion, if we talk about our home, the air volume of the e-commerce goods, about 30% of the freight volume of our home, so there are about 70%, we mainly come from traditional sources, such as those high-tech products, servers, etc., so we believe that in this part of the e-commerce, even after the change of Trump policy after the fact, this impact of our home, it is relatively low.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. In the e-commerce market there may be a change. We are regulating the proportion of e-commerce sources, for example, we are going to increase the proportion of these parts of Southeast Asia, as well as Japan and Taiwan, etc.

In addition, according to the key Registrar of Goods mentioned earlier, we opened a Toronto freight store in February this year. This part is decentralised and expands the possible market share. We believe that the long-haul flight loading and shipment stability will be maintained in the future with the implementation of various policy adjustments and Dynamic management.

In addition, we have an idea about the first half of this year's fare. Regarding fares, everyone is concerned, whether it is to write a report or an individual to spend the trip, everyone may be affected. That's what we are looking forward to in the fare section. Why? Although 2025 has a slight drop in price compared to 2024, we can still look forward to what?

So basically, this supply is not going to scale up too quickly, so the support for the fare has a positive impact. In addition, the airline's various costs, as mentioned in the previous briefing, are all in the electric high, especially the labor costs. Therefore, it is not easy to believe that in this case, each airline's price drop may not be so easy. So based on these considerations, we think that in 2025 we can look forward to the stability of the fare.

There are actually 15,5 million barrels. If compared to the previous year in 2023, we have an increase of almost half a million barrels, and then an increase of about 3%. There are also hints about the progress of the jet interstellar machine, and then there is the question whether there is any benefit or loss of emergency treatment this year. Then here is the answer is that he is actively promoting machine-to-modernity, then we have introduced A3NEO in 2021, and is expected to receive 7879 and 10 models next year, and then there is a new plan for continuous growth in response to passenger demand.

China Airlines recently briefed that the total number of China Airlines' new 3501000 and 10 7879 passenger aircraft were purchased at the end of last year, and then further enhanced the operational capacity of our long-haul routes and the passenger experience. At the same time, China Airlines also acquired 778F for cargo, which is a new generation of cargo aircraft, and then planned to operate with the current 778F and then enhance the competitiveness of our freight market.

We have a lot of new opportunities to go to Taiwan and we have just mentioned a lot of new ones. So we will take a look at the two factors together.

So we are planning a meeting at the beginning of April, so we may wait for a while. Some comrades first asked if the recent geopolitical conflict has ended, and how it affects the volume of freight and the price of freight. In fact, we have already announced the volume of freight and passenger transportation in February this year. Then we can see that the price of that announcement of freight is like January actually there is a 12. 24C and then 2011. 5 in fact, it is still very good to support.

I was wondering if the average salary increase in 2024 would be between 4.5 and 5. Some comrades have asked us to compare our prices with changrong and new yu. So this part is the one.

China Airlines has been very hard in the years since we launched our fleet, so it is a brand new aircraft, so of course, its cost is relatively low, no matter the cost of repair operation, so it may be relatively low, but we have a relatively tight flight to Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, Oceania, we have a very strong flight, this is a part of our fleet that we have more advantages with him, so when we say that the fleet is inevitable you will see that there are times when there is a need to arrange for numbness, and we are sure that we will be more flexible than Changrong.
