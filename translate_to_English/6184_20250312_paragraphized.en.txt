The following is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraphs: Welcome to the Taifeng Cable Co., Ltd. corporate briefing session. Mr. Zhang Mingzhi, General Manager Liu Tanglong, Spokesperson Liu Jiajun, Mr. Ko Yutting Vice President of Finance, and Mr. Cheng is the Vice President of Finance.

I would like to share with you a report on a shipment in 2024. I would like to explain to you how our general manager, Dr. Liu Denglong Liu, will be more focused on the face of the industry, especially now we are more concerned about the rapid progress of the AI generation with our industry. Is there any connection in the big broadband business itself, the financial part?

Thank you for investing in Dafeng Limited today. The first thing I want to start here is from the industry overview, that and some of the timings of our operations, and the financial performance of our finances, explained by our vice president of finance, and the outlook for future operations. I think from the industry overview, we have discovered in the past years that this revolution has continued for 20 years, from the whole parallel computing and the development of neural networks, and has actually continued for the past 20 years.

This is the most important thing in the future. The most important thing here is that we now have a new design system, which is stable and frequent, which is what we believe is most important. And we now observe that it requires a lot of computational AI, because there are a few wave files, and some of them are up and down at the price. In fact, it takes a lot of computational power to get started with AI.

This is the most important business opportunity in Taiwan. It is the most important business opportunity for us to focus on the whole of West Sea, NVIDIA SERVER, of course, this AI SERVER is currently very popular, which is how to combine it with our broadband components to the user home, in fact, the average of us for people when they really use it, you will not really go to IT anywhere at any time. This is the focus of our focus is on broadband traffic, this is the focus of this is because in West Sea, the overall weight can be used, so broadband traffic is this focus.

So we think that the whole AI edge computing should actually happen in our machine room. So we think that the whole AI edge computing should actually happen in our machine room. That can also help these so-called AI service providers save his traffic costs, which is a model we are now urgently looking to explore. Then again, how this entire startup company can make AI landing become a business or home, and now many AI startups want to target customers at home.

The backbone of the company is probably the part that we completed the upgrade in the last year, so of course we have to pay for 10G because it is close to the previous 10G, but we have now expanded the backbone of 100G. This is probably the backbone of the company is currently the network of 100G. So overall we want to emphasize that the overall AI or computing era is the most important or the quality and stability of transmission.

That's right, we've already dropped our UH to this 20G logistics ordinary mind skilled. That's also an advantage for that regulated. So if we add that og temperature is currently 82 billion and the market value is about 3.9 According to the stock price of December 31 last year, this is probably the time of the entire operation last year. Overall, the first thing we're going to look at is a combined revenue of 2.5% compared to 23.4, which is the best part of its location. The revenue of broadband has grown, and then the current is 8,100 million, accounting for 38% of the total revenue.

This is probably the highlight of the last 20 years. The number of broadband users has grown, and the total number of accounts is currently 173,800. The goal we set was to grow 16,500 accounts last year, but we had an excess to complete, probably 17,985 accounts last year.

We would also like to say that, in seeing last year's entire production, customers with 360M or more are probably more than 60%. Compared to 23 years, it is 57%. Therefore, the continuous growth is relatively large and the contribution is relatively large. So the distance we see now is likely to be more than 20% of the customers, and it is also growing.

That's what matters most to us in general. We've raised the whole broadband for everyone, and it's a good thing for us. In fact, it's able to compensate for our so-called urban income gaps. This is probably a relatively important thing for us. So our overall broadband revenue share continues every year.

It's still growing. That's 23 years compared to 33%. If we add our circuits, we have some that are purely rented circuits. Rented income, that's what this circuit is for. If we count it as broadband income, it's up to 39%.

That's part of the overall revenue of broadband. In comparison to the 23-year-old case, the 23-year-old roughly 6,88 million. That revenue reached 808 million last year. The overall growth was 17. 6%.

In fact, the whole of Tai Fung is relatively flexible in terms of relative business. Let's actively put the customer to the place to stay. So here. Last year's turnover rate was only 1.28. That is, of course, better than the average of five revenues 3. 15. That and the independent operator 5. 2.

That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at. That's where we're at.

Is that part of our finances total clients? . The financial performance part first. The financial performance part first, let's take a look at this consolidated statement. That 2024 was last year's revenue for our city.

083 million. 4.8% decrease compared to the previous year. The portion of broadband revenue reached 8 billion. 808 million. That grew by 17. 6% compared to the previous year.

This is what we did last year in 2024. This growth of broadband income has made up for our city income here. This decrease in my consolidated revenue has reached 2.1 trillion. It is also one of the best performances of the past year.

That's about some of the business expenditures we've had in the past year. We've adjusted our operating schedule to pay for some of the public welfare expenses. So it's a bit of a growth. But overall, it's still below 1 billion. Our AVITR has reached 1.1 billion.

The net profit of the parent company. Now 50,000 31.9 million. EPS reached $3.59. Next, look at the various financial indicators. That part of the gross profit margin in the top left corner. 51. 9% hair rate in 2024.

The gross profit margin we talked about in the past five years is also a relatively stable state. It's about 50% down. It's also about 20% down the cost rate. The last year's part of 2024 was just mentioned.

That's the part of AVITR in the upper right corner. AVITR accounts for 52.8% of revenue. That's 2024. AVITR in 2024 has 11 billion. The bottom-left parent company's net profit.

That EPS3. 59. The chart on the right-hand side of the chart shows my 100 million inflows. There were about 1 billion inflows in 2024 last year.

A robust trend. That. There are only a few high and low representations of 100 million in cash flow here. That's why. We're in this part of a relatively large copyright cost. Because it usually takes longer to make a reservation.

So it may be a relatively large one-time payment once the appointment is completed. So there seems to be some ups and downs here. But in general, it is a hundred million cash flow into view. It is also a positive amount. At least also a lot of money here.

Next. Balance sheet. Balance sheet. At the end of 2024, our total assets were $7.3 billion.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to confirm the corresponding sentences for each timestamp. Then, I need to reorganize these sentences according to logic and context into a coherent paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may be disconnected from the timestamp, but the content is continuous, such as about the user growth goals for a limited wind, which may need to be merged into the same paragraph. Next, I will identify each topic or sub-theme, such as user growth plans, brand marketing strategies, technical upgrades, public welfare activities, etc. sentences under each topic should be categorised into the corresponding paragraph.

For example, a description of the blood donation activity may appear in multiple timestamps, and it needs to be integrated into a coherent paragraph that illustrates the goal, outcome and meaning of the activity. In addition, the user mentioned the "big start with love" of blood donation activity is mentioned in many places, and it is necessary to confirm whether these parts belong to the same activity and correctly arrange the sequence of events. For example, the goal of the activity, the results of last year, the setting of this year and the relevant public interest should be presented coherently. In the process of the technical part, such as the proportion of the bandwidth of 360M or more, the implementation of 10G Pong parts, etc., it is necessary to ensure the correct use of the technical term and maintain the accuracy of the original word.

For the public welfare activities section, the user refers to the specific data of blood donation activities, cooperation cities, campaign slogans, etc., need to be integrated into a paragraph, to explain the background, goals and results of the activity. In addition, the award for sustainable business and the achievement, also need to be a separate section, highlight the company's social responsibility and achievements. During the finishing process, also pay attention to the correct mapping of timestamps to ensure that each sentence's position is accurate. For example, in the case of external bandwidth analysis, the user refers to the optimization of 2020, the proportion of Cache, Google and Apple cooperation, etc., these need to be arranged by time or logical order. Finally, check whether the whole paragraph type of transcription is smooth, whether it meets the user's requirements, no omission of any sentences, and maintains order and content. At the same time, make sure that there is not added any personal insights or comment, complete in accordance with the user's written transcription.

In addition, multiple activities and items referred to by users need to be properly classified to avoid confusion. In summary, I need to systematically classify each sentence into the appropriate paragraphs, maintain the order and content of the original, while ensuring that the transition between paragraphs is natural, and the message conveys clear. This requires patience and granular work to ensure that the final paragraph verbatim is both in line with the requirements of the user and is easy to read and understand.

It is our current plan. It is, of course, because it is the brand's overall marketing strategy will be relatively lively, so we want to say that it can be combined with other industries, and there are some new media channels that can open. Last year we had a brand and related advertising cooperation with Rakuten Taoyuan for this season.

We will one day be the event of the title day. That in the future, we expect that we will soon be able to cope with the whole 360M ratio to 60% or even now more than 500M 40%. That is where we want to import the whole 10G Pong component. That is what we expect now. That is what we expect now. That is why we want the whole process to be optimized as a result of some cost control and the success of that process.

The first is that the security is important, so the overall SDR and EDR parts are good. We hope to strengthen this comprehensiveness, because there is also a problem with coverage and management. The second is about enabling electronic for paperless and the entire ERP system, which is probably what we are going to do in the next two years. Of course, we want to say that the entire external bandwidth is our analysis of the external bandwidth, and then quickly say that the first is that the overall broadband analysis of 2020 is optimized. The other is that the ratio of Cache is about 64%, and the external bandwidth is about 36%.

That's about 29% of the current Google traffic in Cache, and we're also working with China ITC, which accounts for about 18% of the total bandwidth. That Apple is optimized, and that's what we saw last year. The entire Apple Plus video, no matter how fast it was imported, has already reached 9% of its iOS traffic. At the end of last year, we imported Microsoft's new Cache, which is what you all used to do when you did some updates about Microsoft, and that's what we're doing now.

We hope to sponsor the big foundation to do these things. I would like to say that there are two films to talk about this event and to start with seven cities and cities from Taipei City, Taipei City, Taiwan, Taiwan, and Hsinchu Miaoli, Miaoli, Taiwan. This is our advertisement. Generations can save a family, let our blood burn again, because your life is full of hope, because love is eternal, let's share the show together again, you will give our love to our generation, Kaohsiung gate guards the life, and greatly let love continue.

Today, we set up the 12,000th generation to break the 18000th generation last year. So today, the target is set to 12,000th generation. So I would like to say that this public activity can help Taiwan's entire comfort of the whole bloodshed, this is a charity event we actively participate in this event together. So, in order to achieve the sustainable development of the whole enterprise, we have issued the same award for the information and communications of the entire enterprise, and we have also won the New Taipei Enterprise Festival's sustainability and innovation investment because we are to participate in the innovation investment category.

I would like to thank Mr. Liu for this briefing. I think that Mr. Liu is a technologist, and he has more than 30 years of experience in the implementation of the AI new product value service. Mr. Liu has been in Hong Hai Group for more than 10 years, and is responsible for the development of the first calculator box of the Hong Hai Group, and later responsible for the 5G and 8K technology implementation.

The second most important thing on this operating platform is not content or product, but transmission services. We want to think so much of the AI, these IDCs are a single isolated island, and these isolated islands should make it a new business to deep into the family, what is the network. So if you say that 5G really can be sorry for the 5G at the peak time, its bandwidth is up to 100M100M if you still use 4G to eat sorry for the peak time of 10M, but in the broadband you can use 400 pieces of service to 360M in a month. So I think broadband is really a real AI infrastructure.

[1506. 90-1508. 44] There is no broadband. [1508. 44-1509. 98] Especially home broadband, now everyone knows the importance of broadband, but without broadband, we can't enjoy the benefits of broadband. [1509. 98-1512. 28] In fact, AI can't land, it takes a lot of data and computing power to operate, broadband is the basis of AI operation. [1512. 28-1515. 60] Our responsibility is to stream these IDC traffic everywhere to home and business. [151515. 60-1518. 16] IDC's traffic needs to be streamed to home and business so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of broadband.

[1518. 16-1519. 44] Streaming to home and business requires a lot of broadband bandwidth. [1519. 44-1520. 72] Home and businesses need broadband bandwidth in order to enjoy the benefits of broadband. [1520. 72-1522. 26] Streaming to home and business requires a lot of broadband bandwidth. [1522. 26-1524. 56] Since we joined the peak, the peak also began to try to work with the industry. [1524. 56-1525. 34] After Liu joined the peak, the development of the peak accelerated. [1525. 34-1528. 14] After joining the peak, the peak began to work with the industry.

[1528. 14-1530. 46] tried to work with the industry, hoping to increase the market share of the peak. [1530. 46-1532. 50] did some junior enterprise users. [1532. 50-1533. 78] Junior enterprise users, need a lot of broadband bandwidth. [1533. 78-1535. 06] refers to the company's local business premises. [1535. 06-1536. 34] The company's business premises, need a lot of broadband bandwidth. [1536. 90-1537. 92] is like the company's local business premises.

[1537. 92-1541. 00] There is a lot of broadband bandwidth required for the company's business premises. [1541. 00-1543. 30] In the past, it had to be using Chunghwa Telecom. [1543. 30-1546. 12] Like we gave him a G-sized 50M upstream. [1546. 12-1548. 16] Save half the price. [1548. 16-1549. 70] They are happy. [1549. 70-1551. 50] Also like a chain of dozens.

[1551. 50-1552. 26] A chain of dozens requires a lot of bandwidth. [1552. 26-1553. 02] is like a chain of dozens. [1553. 02-1555. 34] A chain of dozens requires a lot of bandwidth. [1555. 34-1558. 14] More than 100 chain stores across the country. [1558. 14-1560. 70] We have 60 branches in our operating area. [1560. 70-1561. 74] We work with peers.

[1561. 74-1563. 52] To put these enterprise users in a way that aligns with their peers' strategies. [1563. 52-1565. 32] To include one of these junior enterprise users in the bag. [1565. 32-1566. 34] There is also a province-wide chain parking lot. [1566. 34-1567. 36] The parking lot is now in use with Token. [1567. 36-1568. 90] It has this brand identification system and then billing system. [1568. 90-1570. 94] It is the whole stream going through the solid network.

[1570. 94-1573. 00] These solid nets. [1573. 00-1574. 28] It uses very little bandwidth. [1574. 28-1576. 84] But it pays for it. [1576. 84-1579. 14] will be 50% higher than the home. [1579. 14-1580. 68] For this chain of business users. [1580. 68-1583. 74] Must have sufficient geographical coverage.

[1583. 74-1585. 54] None of our previous owners were able to do this. [1585. 54-1587. 58] This is because of the congenital advantage of China Tianxing. [1587. 58-1590. 92] But now this advantage is slowly broken. [1590. 92-1592. 70] All we have to do is to extend our backbone from 100G to 400G. [1592. 70-1593. 98] Then tandem with IDCs all over the world. [1593. 98-1596. 34]

[1596. 34-1597. 62] The flow is the same as the bank's cash flow. [1597. 62-1600. 70] With the flow, the flow has the flow. [1600. 70-1603. 00] Much more likely to be successful. [1603. 00-1605. 04] That's why the board of directors of the last month. [1605. 04-1607. 86] The summit has determined that the shareholders' meeting is the same. [1607-86-1610. 16] The proposed shareholders would say that the subsidiary's shares are listed on a large broadband distribution.

[1610. 16-1611. 96] The accident of the listing of this branch of stock. [1611. 96-1614. 52] will also benefit the original shareholders of the peak. [1614. 52-1616. 82] This ordinance provides that [1616. 82-1617. 84] the large broadband as long as there is sufficient funds for the business capacity. [1617. 84-1621. 42] When there is sufficient flow. [1621. 42-1623. 48] It will be a new business with the leading force.

[1623. 48-1625. 26] is no longer a science-saving framework for limited television operations. [1625. 26-1626. 30] because he is not subject to the general law. [1626. 34-1628. 64] above report. [1686. 34-1688. 38] There are no other questions here today. [1708. 36-1609. 90] Thank you for visiting this afternoon. [1709. 90-1711. 94]

[1711. 94-1714. 50] We have a very short time to introduce the great peak of the last year is not a good development. [1714. 50-1716. 30] The hope is that. [1716. 34-1717. 62] This year we can make better results. [171717. 62-1720. 44] Thank you for your attention. [1720. 44-1722. 48]
