Here are the rescheduled paragraph transcripts: Thank you all. We are very happy to welcome you all today. We are looking forward to guiding Yuanta Securities' second investment forum. Today, we are particularly invited to continue Mr. Wang Jianming to explain to us.

Let's warmly welcome everyone. Investment is advanced. I will continue to speak to Wang Jianming. Welcome to the forum today.

First, let's take a look at the previous quarter's profit and loss situation. For the first quarter of the year, our revenue was close to 50 billion, 4.9 billion. QQ part was slightly reduced by 0.2%. YY grew by 8.6%. This was mainly because the first quarter, as it was in the fourth quarter of last year, was a sales war machine in our Invert.

That's why we saw a slight improvement in our revenue in the second quarter and the third quarter. Gross profit margins, for example, were near 29.6% from last year's fourth quarter. This is also due to the relationship between Paramis, so it will remain at a level level in the fourth quarter of last year. QQ dropped 0.2 percentage points, YY decreased by 1.4 percentage points.

That part of Europe is about 18.9. Africa is still very low. It is only about 2.5% in Africa and the rest of the world. That is an overview of the first quarter.

The first is the impact of the tariffs on our company. Our company mainly has three production bases. They are mainland China and Vietnam. The mainland of that country encountered the so-called tariff war in 2018. At that time, it was over 25% of the tariff.

So we set up a subsidiary in Vietnam at that time. Then we reduced the impact of tariffs on this income tax. The mainland now accounts for about 80% of our total shipments. The remaining 20% is from Taiwan and Vietnam. The main shipping destination between Taiwan and Vietnam is also a customer of this part of the United States.

That's why we also ship to a U.S. customer. That's why we have 46% higher tariffs for Vietnam and Taiwan, and 32% higher tariffs, respectively. The current impact for us is relatively mild. Because the trade term between us and our customers is called FOB. This means that the tariffs are the customer's own costs.

But this 46% 32% is right. The impact of the guests is very big. So even at the beginning of the announcement of the peer-to-peer tariff, the customer did not have a so-called candle for any order, or a postpone condition. But the guests still hope that we can propose an improvement plan.

So now we're in October. So we're in October. So there's a company here to do some evaluations. The whole Asia has been covered by a high equivalent tariff. That's in addition to Singapore, but Singapore's labor costs are too expensive.

Our company is currently evaluating which UAE is outside of Singapore. So what is his labor cost? His infrastructure. Power provided.



So, this will cause the existing manufacturers to expand, and then attract many new manufacturers, such as some home appliance manufacturers, and grime-mei all came in. So that the natural gas was stable by 23 years, and the government removed the subsidy, so the supply was greatly increased and the demand was back to normal, so the market was a lot of inventory, and until 2024 slowly digested. This situation would cause some confusion in the market, but we look at the fact that like these home appliance manufacturers did not actually do this inverter, so at the end of the day he could not continue.

This is why we think that the effect on gross profit in general should be more saturated when we think that it is going to be that high season. Then please say that after all, Margin has three percent, so why don't you talk about the first thing you just mentioned is Margin is not right, DG and last quarter are very close to zero percent, so this should be the product line, because we all have to report the highest gross profit or the inverter products in the fourth quarter and it will be lower than the first quarter, so it is a normal phenomenon.

But we are a long-term partnership with our customers, so we also have to help our customers to reduce his overall cost, so I just said that 30% is because the UAE is a long way away from the road, so the whole supply chain is still relying on China's production, so this part of the logistics cost, coupled with some cost amortization of some production plants, we evaluated that 30% is a separate tax rate, if more than 30% we set up a plant such that customers have a goal to achieve a cost reduction, this plant is all of the production costs, that is to help customers to reduce this cost, this order can be more orders will grow with each other, because we think like our APC, you should be clear that SE is Snyder, Snyder, Snyder he acquired a U.S.Snyder company, now is the company, SE we are the highest customer, like his revenue in the first quarter, he is close to 22%, he is the largest, the second, the remaining 5%, so we have the remaining 5%, in this case we have to support him.

As an example, we have cooperated with them for more than ten years, the revenue from the three million dollars have been growing so far, it is estimated that the annual K-Girl, compound growth rate is about 30 percent, this is a very high number. So there is a long-term trust between us and guests, so we must help guests to do this cost reduction. If the objective judgment, more than your personal, objective judgment, the whole year with the age or later, objective, judgment, probably the center, what kind of state.

The fastest demand is too strong, for UPS, that inverter he is, his competition is very intense, then his market growth is also very high, like we have seen some reports, he estimates that 2024 to 2032 compound growth rate should be nearly 15%, so it is very high, so our company has entered this market about 10 years ago, especially in some emerging countries, like Pakistan South Africa, we have a local one, a market recognition is high, because although we do not have free brands, but we also say that you can not put our brand on, but, because because our products are very high, so in fact, there are a lot of people named to buy, inverter we buy the products we do, so some customers will even secretly on his show, that the competition in this area is very fierce, although the number is not going to the 207, that will be reduced, 10%, and then 10%, another 10%, and then 30 to 27 percent, this, one, the year, the next, and the next, the next, the next, the same, the same, the same, if it is a, the next, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, and the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same,

The cost of the ID cabinet. It can be longer or 3 to 5 costs. It is probably the whole cabinet.

The server is usually built on the cabinet. It also adds some air conditioning. It is that temperature control, etc. The whole cost is calculated for us. The evaluation is about 3%. I think it is in this server.

It is either a sign of the times, or a sign of the times, or a sign of the times, or a sign of the times, or a sign of the times, or a sign of the times.

That's what AI Data Center is all about. It's been really busy lately, but I think.

AI Data Center is for every purpose. It's for every purpose. Each server's Power Consumption. It's for energy consumption. Because it's for a significant increase in computing power, it's also for a significant increase in energy consumption.

Like before. A server is about 5,000 watts. Now one is up and running 20 kW. So this energy consumption is significantly higher. You have a large AI Data Center that. That UPS is usually above Megawatt level.

There may even be 3 to 5 Megawatts. That's the case with UPS products. We generally say that more than 20 kW is high power. High power will be divided into the middle and ultra high power.

The past decade has been dominated by a line of brands. Because it is protected by the Data Center behind it for more than 20 kW, it will be the Service Center.

Because it's like just saying a cost of 3 to 5%. It'll be willing to spend a little more money. Buy it. There is a brand of a vendor. And some of its subsequent maintenance repairs are also more complex.

As I just said this. This Schneider it outsources to us a 200 kW. It is actually this. This outsourced trend of high power is constantly expanding. In addition to this. Like some other line of brands in Europe.

Some of the products in the area are also starting to outsource to us. It is also 200 kW 60 kW.

The AI Data Center has almost no direct help for us. Because all of them are first-line brands in their field of self-control, but the indirect help is actually seen. Because of that, the AI Data Center is one of them.

The demand is rising too fast. That's why UPS first-line brands are theirs. A large part of this ultra-high-power UPS's capacity has been fully loaded. It's like one that tells us about their next two years. capacity is already fully occupied.

So, this leads to a phenomenon that first-line brands will start. Review a resource allocation within, and they will start to speed up some.

Speed up some of these UPSs with land power. Then add the product. Expand it. Go to UPSs for this high price AI Data Center for production. So this is one of them.

The second is. We also see. There are some opportunities for the second-line brands to start, because in the past, the second-line brands have almost no chance for such high power.

There is no reason for them not to have after-sales service from design to follow-up maintenance. That money is not as strong as the front line brand. So he can't do well. So in this case, high power he almost doesn't enter. But now UPS.

High power has a trend. It is modular. Modular means that every module is broken. As long as it is fast. This module.

Make a replacement. He can get back to normal. That's why his subsequent maintenance and repair will be very good. Simple. Plus AI Data Center. Let the front line brand have their full capacity.

So there are some orders in this case that go out to the second-line brand. So this is a great opportunity for our company. So we have now received a lot of second-line brands. They have some cooperation plans with us at the beginning of this high power.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. BBU has been around for a long time. It's only now that the battery has been replaced with a lead-calculated battery.

We see that he is a little different from us in the field of BBU application, because he has a relationship with NVIDIA's design, so he needs to have one.

A function of the power of the wind fills the valley. He needs BBU. That BBU is his main supply chain. If you look at it, you will notice. The main thing to do BBU is to do power supply.

It's because it's a bit like adding a battery to make a small adjustment. It's a product that prefers a mass production. Our company is only doing this highly customized product. So we're not going to take it in. **Please note that because the format of the transcription is not complete, please adjust the paragraph format yourself.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding texts. For example, [3015. 82-3016. 34] Well, the next one is Literally, Jeopardy, near me, etc. Some sentences may not be coherent, or have duplicated parts, such as "because" appeared twice, and "I" repeated. This may be because the speaker pauses or repeats himself when thinking or correcting himself.

For example, the discussion about the UAE community and the adjustment of the Vietnam plant may belong to the same topic, while the part of the high-power project is another topic. During the process, I will make sure that each sentence is retained in its original order without any modification. For example, the user mentions the "nearly what I am" part, although it may look wrong, but must be retained as it is.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, from discussing the adjustments of the UAE community to the Vietnam plant, to supply chain issues, these parts may require segmentation, but keep the original position of each sentence. During the process, there may be some challenges, such as how to deal with unconsistent sentences or duplicate content. For example, "because" appears twice, it may be necessary to retain both, even if they look duplicated.

At the same time, check the logical consistency between paragraphs to ensure that the reader understands the transition between different topics, although the original content may be jumping or repeating. In summary, the process requires careful follow of the user's instructions, keeping the original content and sequence of each sentence, while reasonably organizing a paragraph, making the overall structure easier to read, without changing any original information. </think> The following is a paragraph-based transcription after finishing (totally retaining all the original content, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed any sentence): ---. Literary.

I'm close to you, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Because, then, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I am not.

No, I am, I am, I am, I am, I hope, I am.

It's a bit of a slap in the face, or a slap in the face, or a slap in the face, or a slap in the face, or a slap in the face, or a slap in the face.

But it's not going to get any worse, it's going to be better than what we've seen, and I think it's going to be better than what we've seen.

Since last year's base year was really very high. Is there any advanced investment problem, about half of it, because of the UAE community.

It is the duty of the person to pay taxes, so the customer starts with the main, or the American customer, but because the UAE is very good, we are a very important market.

So we go to the UAE. So it is actually a hub port. So many of its products go into the UAE after it will turn. It will bundle into a final product after it will turn to a large part.

So we set up the UAE, we can reduce the impact of the equivalent tariffs, we can also get close to it.

To be closer to our UAE. The customer of the inverter. So this is another accompanying. One advantage. Please say. Go to the UAE community after the words.

There is not a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed, nor a grain of mustard seed.

How to fill. Because we also rent Vietnam. So this part is done. Adjustments can be very fast. And the cost for the company is not too much. Vietnam factory if you really want to be in the UAE community.

Vietnam factories may be small in size at first. But they will not be completely withdrawn. This is not necessarily because they are mainly out of the United States. There is also a part out of India. Because India has relations with China.

Sometimes it's not that good, so some Indian customers will ask for it. We're going to ship from Vietnam. So all the time we'll see a change in the overall.

No. Because we look at the whole. A power supply chain like UPS. Mainly in mainland China. And our supply chain is not easy to move.

Then a highly customized product. So in this case, the supply chain also provides a small amount of variety. A highly customized component. So this is not easy to move. And our company has a relatively strong place.

It is because we have very high vertical integration. Our company in addition to semiconductor and battery. Other things also have a strong function. Other things like transformer. Chassis power cord. Heat sink.

We probably have more than half of them in-house. These are all in mainland China. So take this whole set. Moving out of mainland China is not easy. Please tell. Some future plans.

What do you think of him, and what do you think of him, and what do you think of him, and what do you think of him?

Yes. Some projects currently received. Like the biggest guest. He also gave us a 320 kW. Then a French company also gave 320 kW. There was also a Spanish customer.

He also gave 400 kilowatts. That's all in continuous cooperation, like that one. There's another Italian company. He's also working with us.

It's also 400 kW. That's where we started. A product test for the first stage is done. Then it's to send them to their company for the second stage of the test. Then it's to send them to their company for the second stage of the test. So overall.

Because we are a small number of products. So usually one product. Lead time. The lead time is at least 6 months. That high power may take more than a year. So look at the total number of projects.

We think it's very healthy. It's also in line with our growth expectations. That's when you're talking about it. How much of this I can't do.

That's your economic sense. This year you'll contribute to the high-power projects you've received. He's probably how much. Your economic sense. From 300 to 400 kW before.

Project is probably. It is a lot over 10. 300 to 400 kW are all land in progress. Because it is not said once, so many projects start at the same time. He is land in progress.

There has been a constant increase. That's the year. That's the year. The biggest guest of the 320 kW. That should have a chance to ship. That's the total revenue share.

Let's see now. This first quarter of this year is about 6.5. We think the future should be. It should be around 3 to 5 years. It can be increased to about 10%. We are now comparing.

The distance is more than 20 kW. Right now. All are out. There are 200, 300, 400 kW. So this becomes.

"We have 60 kilowatts in the middle, these are 80 kilowatts, yes, for the power we have now, there are some, and we are gradually rising.

That's what we're talking about. --- **Correspondence Description**: 1. Keep all original verbs without deleting any statements. 2. Arrange them in chronological order and segment them according to semantic logic. 3. Keep all repeated statements (e.g. "because", "I", "I") 4. Keep all grammatically incomplete or semantic broken original statements (e.g., "close to me", "assigned") 5. No explanatory text or consonant words are added. 6. Keep all original punctuation and tone words (e.g., "positive", "positive").

There is also a lot of planning going on, so there is a lot of this part of it is Tier2 guests, right. Then there is a middle-end target market for this so-called AI Edge Computing, which is a relatively small AI Data Center. Then we also received some more special case. Like we have a second-line brand, he asked us to do this kind of rack-mounted UPS, but he was not using a wire-based battery, he was using a lithium battery, he is supercapacitor.

Yes, there are some more special projects to do. Well then, now it's this practicallysecsagente. There's another question about investing in cash. Thank you for your question. Today's Qiue time is over, thank you again for continuing the speech of the Chief Financial Officer Gold Coin, and thank you very much for all the guests, who will start the next meeting at 10:50. Thank you all, you will help me think, good, thank you.
