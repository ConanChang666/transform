The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase transcript: I look forward to IR Tina. I am delighted that today we took the time to attend our 4th Quarter Investor Conference in 2024. Today's online language management team also has executive vice president Mr. Ng King Tse, and the Chief Financial Officer and Spokesperson Mr. Li Wei-jen. We started today's briefing. The fourth quarter of 2024 had a turnover of 30% of NT$, while the previous quarter decreased by 4. 2%, but the same period of the previous year rose by 18%.

The main reason for the decrease in the above quarter is because the demand for servers is in the transition period of product conversion, so the relevant product pull capacity has decreased. However, due to the continuation of the AI wave, we estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2024, Server-related revenue will also be very good. The turnover of the whole year in 2024 reached 14.6 billion yuan, which is a record high in recent years.

We can see a positive growth in the fourth quarter of last year when only cars and household appliances were in the same category. The other is a recession. Parts from left to right cars grew by 8.7% compared to the previous quarter and accounted for 11.1% of revenue. Channels declined by 25.5%, with a revenue ratio of 4.9%.

The household appliances category grew by 2.7% compared to the previous quarter, accounting for 3.4% of revenue. Industrial and medical sector declined by 5.4%, accounting for 9.2% of revenue. Part of the broad and four appliances declined by 1%, accounting for 9.2% of revenue. More than 5 out of 5 reached 55.1%. Laptops and office equipment declined by 8.8% and 16.1% of revenue.

A clear view of the vehicle and the broad four components is the main growth and pull-up power of the year last year. Other categories remain subject to end demand sluggishness, as well as stock adjustment factors, so the relevant demand remains unsettled. The parts of the vehicle grew 33.6% compared to last year, accounting for 11% of revenue. Channels declined 25.8% and accounted for 5.3% of revenue. Home appliances declined 29.1%, accounting for 3.5% of revenue. Industrial and medical sector declined 9.3%, accounting for 8.9% of revenue.

Broad and four devices have grown significantly by 45.8% and accounted for 53.1% of total revenue. Laptops declined by 9.2% and accounted for 10.1% of total revenue. Industrial and medical sectors declined by 17.5%. Profitability, in the fourth quarter of last year, continued to improve the product portfolio, coupled with positive exchange rates, reached 30.3% in the fourth quarter. The gross profit margin for the whole year also improved to 28.4% in the previous year.

The net interest rate after tax was 10.2% in 2024. Last year's fourth quarter US stock surplus was $1.6 and 2024 was 10.2%. The US stock surplus was $5.46 for the whole year in 2024. The distribution of US stock cash 3.7 is expected to be the same as the previous year, and the interest rate remains at 68%.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Helen from Dialyne, you can now speak. Vice President, because just announced this February's revenue, and then it looks like the outlook for the first quarter is a bit better than the previous recession, and QoQ, then the gross profit margin in the fourth quarter is 30%, but it is actually a lot better than before.

Thank you. I'm going to reply to your gross profit margin first, and that's what we're going to do next year. We're going to ask our Vice President Simon to answer your question. That's why the gross profit margins can reach below 30% in the fourth quarter of last year, and of course, the best part of the product portfolio.

This is the reason why the price is relatively high in the first quarter of the year, so the price is also able to maintain a fixed rate, so this is a positive help. In February, the revenue factor and this we asked Simon to explain to you. Well, I think that in February, the part of the revenue should be said that the first quarter of the year should be pretty optimistic, and in the QoQ section I want to grow, especially in the whole, because the results of February also appear well, the results of that February are in comparison to last year's YOY growth. In the first quarter of the year, there is no big problem, the trend in the future, I think that the amount of orders on this side of Q2 is still stable, so the trend is positive.

That's why we may be looking forward to the first quarter of this year, but now we just have the executive department to show that it looks like the growth of QoQ is definitely not a problem. Here's a more optimistic expectation, so ask yourself if this is the server that's going to be driven here or because of Deep-Seek. We simply see that it's server-related, and that's not the AI server part, so we should also mention the so-called Deep-seek or the original GPT, where I believe that the more and more application of the market will become more and more popular.



*** Q&A *** Q&A *** Q&A *** Q&A: In the current transfer application, there is no approximate revenue ratio between the pure fan and Liquid2Air, or we can split it this year's growth, what kind of level? *** Q&A: OK We are still the main fan at the moment, and the part of the Liquid2Air is included in the report, we are actually engaged with several familiar clients are talking about the next generation of implementation and recognition, so you say the proportion part, the performance of the current stage is still the main fan. *** Q&A: ** Thank you, please try again Angela, cut off your microphone and ask questions.

**Q:** Have you heard my voice? **Q:**Yes, thank you. **Q:** I want to talk to the general manager here is a follow up question, just mentioned the AI, I know that AI is based on ASIC, so I can not further tell us what is the main customer area of the ASIC right now. **A:** All customers as long as the current fan, under the high wind pressure and high performance requirements, all customers should be able to see us.

A: I believe that the future outlook is more than what we are looking forward to in the future, whether it is 200 or 300 GB or 300 GB, maybe not as hot as ever, but there is no GB200 and 300, but there is no GB200 and 300 part of the performance we present in Q1, so I believe that whether it is 200 or 300 joining, or more booming, I believe that the future outlook is more than what we are looking forward to. ** Q: Please note that we see the status of the order here, it is expected that there will be a relatively large amount of contribution at what time? ** A: You are talking about the 200 part?

It's not ASIC or GB, OK gross profit margin is not really the same thing, it should be to see that the fan performance is actually a little bit of the fan, OK understand. ** Well, this should be higher than our average situation against the previous chief financial officer to say the double fan is to improve our current gross profit margin fan, OK, so it is likely that the server is larger than the average, and then AIServer is larger than the average. ** A:** It is OK to understand. ** Q: ** That just mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer that some of our next new product research and development measures may increase our costs, I don't know that this number should be used this year, last quarter of last year, can be used as a benchmark all year?

For example, you may be jumping to more than 7 quarters now, then we should use a ratio to see more objectively later this year. ** A:** Ratio is more objective, because we are now about 16 points, will try to control more than 16 points, but with the increase in revenue, this R&D fee will also come, but in ratio, we try to control not to have too many differences from last year, or this 16 points last year as a indicator of a good understanding of OK. ** Q:** We also mentioned that the idea of the first quarter is relatively optimistic, in addition to just mentioning this server business, may have some side-by-side results in the first quarter, so it may not be possible to talk with us, each division in the first quarter, and the next quarter will be more than we expect.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the meaning and context of each sentence. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check the original transcription one by one, paying attention to the timestamps and the corresponding sentences. For example, the first sentence is [1839. 92-1842. 92], which means that each of our business units will be in 2025. The next one is [1842. 92-1845. 92] will feel like a positive growth. It looks like the two sentences are a continuation of the same topic and should be merged into a paragraph. Next, I need to identify different topics or turning points in the conversation.

Similarly, segmentation is also required when discussing different topics such as gross interest rates, material impact, the progress of Switch and Wi-Fi 7. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same question or to the continuation of the answer, such as about the server growth force and the proportion of AI. These should be arranged consistently to form natural paragraphs. At the same time, blanks or jumps in timestamps (e.g. [2105. 92-109.92]) may indicate pauses or skips in a conversation, but the user requests not to delete anything, so they must keep these timestamps and correctly arrange the corresponding sentences.

In addition, be aware of the interaction in the conversation, such as the structure of the question and the answer. For example, after a user asks a question, the answerer may need to explain in a separate way, and these parts need to maintain the original order and structure. For example, on the gross profit margin section, the answerer first mentions the improvement in the gross profit margin of the car and then discusses the other sections, and finally summarizes the overall trend, which should be handled segmentally.

For example, there is a timestamp in the original verbatim [2105. 92-2109. 92], but the corresponding sentence is "the material will have some impact this year", and needs to be checked to ensure that all the contents are properly arranged. After completing the preliminary paragraph, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim, make sure that no sentence is missing, and that all the contents are arranged in the original order, and that the appropriate separation between the paragraphs makes reading smoother. At the same time, confirm the correctness of the timestamp, make sure that each timestamp corresponds to the correct sentence, no place or duplicate. In summary, the whole process needs to be handled carefully, identify the dialogue structure, maintain the integrity and consistency of the content, and strictly adhere to the user's requirements, without any deletion or alteration.

If you look at YOY, you may not notice that YOY, if you look at YOY, you may be in the notebook section. If YOY looks at YOY, I think it may not meet our expectations, so it may not meet the current situation in the market. If you look at YOY, it may not meet our expectations.

So I can tell you from the point of view of YOY, is it possible that other than notebooks are growing? Yes. Then the server side of the growth force is relatively strong? Yes. Well, the AI in the server can update this figure, there is about the direction of the whole year? This part I take a look at a little while, okay.

If the data for the whole year last year accounted for 52% of the total server, then 52% of the general server accounted for 52% of the total server, then Segment is 48%? Yes. What kind of structure change is there for each segment this year?

In the past six quarters, the gross profit margin of the car was probably in a relatively disadvantageous position, but fortunately this part of our design improvement with some of the on-site efficiency improvement, in fact, the car's gross profit margin is improved, in fact, the speed of the car's gross profit margin is also in line with our expectations, so this part of the car's gross profit margin is back to a better level, although it is still a little lower than the Copper Average, but has been compared to the previous low water margin of the gross profit margin level, there is a considerable improvement, then we expect that the car's gross profit margin is still improving, or give a relatively positive expectation, because the last two years, such as the dealership or the medical equipment, and the demand is relatively weak, so the production scale benefit is also more difficult to play out, but 25 years, we have a lot of a lot of a lot of the same thing about the next year.

This is probably better than last year, but the extent of this part I may be less inconvenient to reveal, but I think it's pretty optimistic. OK, if it's in the proportion of last year's, how much is it? I've given this data last year? You've just a little bit, I've given this data to the data. Switch and Louter, about 7 6% of the total revenue last year, so it's likely that YOY has declined 3% over the last year, because it's probably that the demand for Wi-Fi 6 is not so strong, and it's not too hot for the whole switch, so this year's probably our Wi-Fi 7 penetration rate and the 800G Switch penetration rate is what we've been looking forward to, so it's just what Simon's been talking about in the second half.

This is the part that stimulates the whole industry, the whole segment of recover in 2025? Well, I answered you, it is very good that our team is currently on the shore to visit this kind of customer, indeed, the market is very fast, but this part of the market is very fast, but still convergence, I can only say that the market has just begun, convergence, the current order or demand is a relatively fragmented part, so I believe that in the past two years will be converged, but the market is certainly not clear, so the company now see the demand mainly from China?

The water-cooled part, our current planning for water-cooled part is from the water-cooled plate to the CDU part.

This part of our R&D team will be set up in five shares, and the five shares here we have a new factory. This part should be in the end of July, the experiment will start, the new lab will be in the five shares, then the point we are in the mass production is in Huizhou. So you can understand whether this part is mainly in the Chinese market, Chinese customers, or not, starting from the beginning should say, we first focus on this part of the Chinese factory to build, of course, the future needs of customers, if the needs of the United States, or outside of China, we also have overseas to search for some of the factory area, that is just said now, we have to build here near China, why not in the Philippines production, supply chain, understand, thank you.

I would like to ask the best of us in the current overall, for AI Server and general server a fan needs, clear and optimistic, that is just in the client I want to tell you, we do not see at the moment, is the major customers in the AI Server spending and general server spending, there is no competition, that is to say, the general less spend a little, more focus on the AI on the project, this part should say, because we in the general server, did not see too many decline, but said the AI server grew up, so that you say that there is no AI, and then reduce the input on the general server, the current trend, should not be such a trend, should grow up, understand, thank you. At present, I am looking at the growth of this field, at present, there is still a team to give my number, the team to my number is every field will be, but strong strength, they can be confident, but at the present time I if in accordance with the current situation, is not reached this way, may be in the notebook part, is the notebook part of the force, at present I have not yet reached the expected part, so I see at the moment, the rest is still positive, understand. So, like industrial home appliance, these last year's basis is relatively low, so growth will also feel more positive, is likely to be like a double-digit growth, if such a weak component, the current rebound may be more than the need, or a smooth, possibly a figure, like, or a picture, may be compared the bottom out demand, or a double-digit, or a strong growth, if I should be based on my environment, should be a relatively calm market, like a relatively calm, like a relatively calm, like this, like a relatively inferior, or these, or the smaller, the smaller, but the smaller, the server.

I believe that this part of the force will come soon, because it is not a consumer market. This is a relatively consumer market part, it does not have a new thing. You say that there is a very large growth, this may not be high expectations, I understand. We just mentioned that there is a relatively likely wifi 7 and 800G of this piece. Can you tell us what we see here is the growth of the difference between 400G and 800G.

This ASP is very different from SPAC, which we can expect to see better growth this year. OK 800G or 400G, I believe it is a generation exchange. Then I believe how many AI servers, I believe the corresponding switch should go here too. uh I believe the corresponding switch should go here too.

I think it should be absolutely uhable. Can you understand that I have not seen a relatively large upgrade on the specifications? Have you seen some upgrades on the fans from wifi5 to 6 or 400G to 800G, respectively? In the 400G 800G switch this uh specification is like the server, its specifications are getting more and more demanding specifications.

This part is really on the outside fan there will be a bigger upgrade. WiFi7wifi5 or the previous wifi6 is the part of the router, this uh specification does not have a more breakthrough growth. But it is a change of tide, which was originally a business that we are aiming for. So this part is not a special change, 800G only treated up, 800G is also a conversion.

If you are looking for a high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality, high-quality.

I don't just want to explain how much my market is, or what a customer I am. I believe the specification is just as good as what our Chief Financial Officer said, and he also went to the head fan factory in the field of improvement, which was originally the one for the leading head fan factory in the field of improvement.

I think this business is so big, and people who want to join later will probably be a lot. But this business represents a reliable and reliable, and I want to say that reliability and dare not use it. uhha, even if there are many successors, every generation in the case of change, in the case of better and higher performance, uhha, even if the forwarder follows, I believe that it will not be the same as the predecessors in the design specifications. uhha dare not use it and if you don't want to use it, it will depend on whether you say such an investment is worth it. uhahahah it will contain what you see or the original few, uhhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahha is a famous factory in the top of the industry. hahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhah, it is a factory.

I'm not sure if this is the same as the server and switch, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the server and switch. I'm not sure if it's the same as the one I mentioned, but it's a good thing. I'm not sure if it's the cooler master? The cooler master I believe is the most powerful thing in metal processing.
