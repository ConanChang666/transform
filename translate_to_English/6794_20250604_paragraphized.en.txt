<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be kept in the same format. Next, I will check the provided verbatim fragment to see if there are any timestamps or numbers that need to be processed.

For example, the first sentence is "from the Biomedical Technology Section Ltd", followed by the "online bill briefing session", and the two sentences may belong to the beginning of the same paragraph, introducing the basic information of the activity. Next, the management team members, each member's name and greeting should be separate, but may need to be merged into the same paragraph to maintain a smooth flow. During the process, I need to pay special attention to whether the interval between timestamps is reasonable, whether there are omissions or duplicate sentences. For example, there is a "hello" at [18. 56-19. 06], but the previous sentence is [18. 00-18. 56]," "asset manager Liu Ruiyu," where there may be an error in timestamp, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it must be retained the original, even if there is overlap or interval.

In the case of technical content, such as company profile, new drug development, financial profile, etc., to maintain the accuracy of professional terms, without any modification. For example, the term "one-piece stem cell", "FDA", "TFDA" and other terms must be retained to ensure the correct conveyance of information. Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph-style transcription to check whether all the original sentences are properly preserved, without omissions or errors, and paragraph divisions are reasonably consistent with reading habits.

</think> [paragraph type transcription]: From the online bill briefing session of the Biomedical Technology Section Limited. Next, we will introduce you to our online team today. We welcome our Chairman, Ms. Chua Yiwen. Ms. Hung Yi Pui, General Manager.

Hello everyone. Gather the Head of Management Mr. Liu Ruiyu. Hello everyone. Accounting Director Mr. Liu Mengting. Hello everyone. So start the agenda today.

First, we asked General Manager Hung to present a briefing on the company's business strategy and vision for the future. Next, we would like to introduce you to the operation and development direction of Rong Biotechnology. Below are the disclaimers. Today's briefings are divided into four main areas: company profile, new drug development and verification, and our financial and business overview.

The company was established in 2018 as a division. The current capital is 6.6 billion. The current capital is 6.6 billion. We were listed on the Innovation Edition last May 21, 2024. The current number of employees is 39. It is mainly our PhD research and development personnel to carry out the technology and development applications of our stem cells.

Our main focus is on degenerative diseases. The first entry into the new drug is our degenerative knee arthritis. The first entry into the new drug is our degenerative osteoarthritis. Together with the U.S. FDA and TFDA Taiwan, we are now recruiting patients in the next phase of the new drug development. The second entry into the new drug development is chronic kidney disease.

We are pleased to share with you that our new stem cell drugs, whether for use in degenerative pelvic osteoarthritis or chronic kidney disease compatible stem cells, alexy, were recognized by Taiwan's only national-level pharmacopoeia awards in 2021. This is the first pharmacopoeia to receive the Gold Medal in Taiwan in 20 years. And this year we are pleased that our one stem cell, the new one from another's healthy young stem cells for treatment of chronic kidney disease, was approved by the US FDA for rapid review.

At the same time, we are not only recognized for the qualification of clinical trials, but also for the examination of the pharmacopoeia in Japan after birth. Therefore, our quality system at the international qualification requirements above is to ensure the quality of all our sterile preparations developed at home and abroad as the greatest principle. Why do we take stem cells as the starting point?

As a result, we hope that our lives and quality of life can be improved well without having to rely on equipment for a longer life, and in fact, there is a low quality of life that is not good for life or relying on equipment. Stem cells can just meet the medical needs of such an elderly society. The research and development of two new stem cell drugs that have already been invested to Rong is important for the global elderly society. The first degenerative suction arthritis is a 10% annual increase in global growth.

The second part of kidney disease is also a serious problem in the global ageing society. Just as part of Taiwan's annual health care expenditure is on average at NT$560 billion. And this is our annual number of patients or the population of dialysis is growing and increasing. Taiwan's current population of chronic kidney disease is 43 million people. So if the new drug for stem cells has a good breakthrough in chronic kidney disease and is different from the current efficacy, avoiding the patient from entering new life, not only brings a good treatment direction for the patient, but also reduces the financial burden of our country.

Stem cell therapy has been used in many countries around the world for more than 30 years, including the United States in 2020, to fight against immune regulation. Therefore, the Stem cell therapy is not only a non-repellent phenomenon, we can use someone else's healthy active ability to use a more one-piece stem cell to treat, not only anti-repellent but also inhibit inflammation and regulate immunity. At the same time, the stem cell also secretes a lot of external hysteresis and next-tree growth factors to repair damaged cells that have already deteriorated.

In addition, stem cells can also be divided into different types of cells, various types of cells, such as cartilage division, nerve division, etc., to verify his potential for treatment of future degenerative diseases in different tissues and functional degenerative diseases.

In addition, we have entered the third phase of the clinical trial, and soon we can report the results of the next phase of the clinical trial with you. The second one of our stem cells is used for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, which is also a one-year injection of essential oils, into the whole body cycle, and after a year of tracking only once a treatment. This is the first clinical trial of the US FDA to allow Taiwan to enter the whole body cycle with one-piece stem cells. We have not only verified the safety and effectiveness of a single stem cell in the newly mentioned knee treatment...

The following is a reversible paragraph-by-phrase transcript: The value of safety is also seen in the treatment of the whole body cycle, so in the future, both in the development of chronic kidney disease and other diseases, a compatible one-piece stem cell has been tested through this clinical trial to verify the safety tolerance of the whole body blood circulation system. At the same time, we have also seen a year of tracking, whether it is within 24 weeks of six months or 48 weeks of the year, we can see that our middle and even severe kidney disease patients, up to a year of stable kidney function EGFR index, not only continues to deteriorate, but also some people recover.

We have also developed many applications of age-related degenerative diseases, including eye degenerative retinopathy, which can be applied in the future network pathology, liver inflammation, etc. There are also difficult wounds, Parkinsons and elderly diseases, which are the potential and direction of the future development of stem cell and stem cell derivatives that may be applied in the future. The following is a simple explanation of our financial profile, currently in the year 2024, our balance sheet is shown as follows, mobile assets at 59 million, the first quarter of 2025 at 68 million, and the current net worth per share at 12.86.

We are also developing more stem cell applications on degenerative diseases, in addition to existing two clinical new drugs and more advanced medical needs to be actively invested in the future, so we have a certain percentage of our research into the early stage. So in the research and development part, from 2023 to 2024, we have different pre-clinical degenerative research in our different clinical development, about 820 million people, an average of about 1 billion a year of research and development expenditure, this is our main expenditure and research and development accounted for more than 70% of all costs.

In addition, we have established an ISO testing laboratory, which can detect and control the requirements of pre-, intermediate and post-sterile preparations, and release the final product. In addition, we have developed a stem cell new drug for the development of cell technology in the stage of clinical progress, both at home and abroad. At the same time, we have obtained a number of cosmetic and international certification of raw materials derived from stem cell technology, and have successfully sold to different countries as raw materials for cosmetic development.

Therefore, we hope to have more development and expansion of our business in the future, including a large number of production of CDMO cell production services, as well as special methods of cooperation with major hospitals, customized cell services, and ISO testing laboratory testing services.

In addition, we will also develop more applications in degenerative diseases, because we have a liquid stem cell bank with multi-medical characteristics, and there are more degenerative diseases of elderly society degenerative knee arthritis, which can be used to carry out new medical courses and new cells for the development of many derivative applications and potential.

Good start. The first question is when the company expects to get a drug certificate if the double-digit selection progress is not determined. Whether or not it has already been authorized to Nanzoo and the estimated amount of authorization.

We hope to complete this third issue as soon as possible. After completing this, according to our plan, we should have an observation period of one year. After that observation period is over, we will apply for this formal certification. This is not a concept of regeneration bilateral probation, but a concept of formal probation.

The second question is, how long is the company's current stock estimate, and how long can it be metaphorized for the company's future operation, the company's stable stem cell source after obtaining a warrant. Thank you. Our company's cell bank basically does not have a lot of problems, we have been through a detailed assessment at the early stage of our development, so we have created a cell bank, from seed library to work library to final production library, its computing and production volume include the two-thirds of our early development, clinical trials to the future drug market, and just mentioned, whether it is more than three million people in tin osteoarthritis or chronic kidney disease, the number of more than two million people in Taiwan, this amount should be enough.

The second question is that there are many peers in the same industry, and that the competitive advantage of Zong Rong is mainly, the first of our clinical trials, whether it is in tin osteoarthritis, currently the only one has entered the three formal cases, and is also the only one to get the United States and Taiwan at the same time, so at the same time to obtain the approval of two national authorities at the same time, for the future international authorization or international partner cooperation is advantageous. The first of these two questions is to explain the progress of each phase of the trial, and the progress of the trial, and the timing of obtaining the drug certificate. Basically, we can only say sorry, because the trial is blindly designed, so it is not possible to report with you at this stage what he said, so we will take a look at our trial, we have entered the formal receipt to recruit patients at the next generation medical center, that is, there is a schedule plan, time planning, the chronic kidney disease, the completion of the second phase of the trial report analysis, and also the U.S. FDA and TFDA, so, the company has planned the next phase of the trial design discussion, it is expected that soon to submit evidence of the trial, because the next stage of the new drug has been the indicator case, so we have a very good communication at each stage.

For example, for health insurance, the average health insurance burden for each person with kidney disease, including dialysis, is 57, the national burden. For this reason, we will evaluate the burden of the national burden and the cost of all the treatments, to obtain a reasonable strategy. That is our simple explanation. The progress of the cooperation with Mandu company, this honorary animal source has already cooperated well with Mandu's all-round, so you can go to Mandu's French Kerr Salon to receive the care of the foreign body.

We should also start this preparation work on a regular basis, and we hope that in this section as soon as possible, we will see that we have started a progress toward the general version, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
