Hello, all of you, investment advanced and legal person friends. We are very honored to be invited today. Fengxing Steel Co., Ltd. was invited to participate in the Securities General Conference.

Describe the operation of the company. Business and financial situation. That's the legal meeting of today. It's an honor to be invited. Co-ordinator Chen Deyi Chen. And Co-ordinator Chong Wen-Tze Chong.

Let us give thanks and praise to the Lord, for He is good, for He is good, for He is good, for He is good, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever.

Thank you so much for your continued support. That's it, and that's what we're doing today. We're going to start today. That's what we're going to do today.

They report last year's fourth quarter. Along with last year's whole year's, there are some financial signs. Then come back and wait. This will be the case here. According to this industry.

It's open. Let's talk about the future. Then we had a big message from the board yesterday. That might take a while.

This is what God has said in His Word: "Let us make known unto you this day, that we may observe and do according to all that we have commanded you, and that we may observe and do according to all that we have commanded you."

And it came to pass, when the days of the Lord were ended, that the glory of God came upon him, and the glory of God was upon him, and upon him, and upon him, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples, and upon his disciples.

Sales chart. The fourth quarter of last year was 17.25 billion. It was better than the third quarter. Because the third quarter is usually a relatively low season. There is also the issue of tax holidays.

14 percent increased. The portion of that line is. Well, the fourth quarter last year. Revenue is 20. 24.

This part should be pretty much the same. This may take a bit of a change in the number. Wait for it to be removed. He will explain it again. The present part is 49.2 billion. That is an increase of 9%.

That's always 86.86 million. That's probably 6 percent more than the third quarter. That's probably the year before. It's probably not all the digit changes. There are some possible changes in the middle of the product organization.

That's what I looked at last year. That's what the steel is for. That's still selling. 7.17 That's the same as the previous year. You're 8% less than the previous year. That's mostly last year.

The price went down on the road. The second part was a small recession. The line was the same as the previous year. The line was the same as the previous year.

Last year there was a relatively temperate year. So last year's line here for the whole year was 82. 82 million more than the previous year was an increase of 10%. The rebar is probably about the same level. His revenue last year was 193 million.

That year all the products were added to 343 billion. That year all the products were added to 343 billion. That year all the products were added to 343 billion. That's probably the same as the previous year. That's almost the same as the previous year.

That's back to the product portfolio. It's probably currently maintained. The rebar is more than 50 percent. That's close to 60 percent here. The new steel last quarter was 20 percent. The line was 23.

Rebar 57. Compared to the third quarter or the fourth quarter of the previous year. Probably. The quality is not very different. Domestic sales last year. Last year that was 91 percent.

Exports are 9 percent. It's probably not too much of a change. That's all year round. It's probably the percentage of new steel that remains. It's about 20 percent of new steel. Line 24%.

56% of rebars. This probably didn't change much. That was the fourth quarter of last year. The new steel was 77,000 tonnes. This was an increase of 19 percent.

The line is roughly the same. 86,000 tonnes. It is flat. The rebar is 257,000 tonnes. It is 11 percent higher than the third quarter. It is the third quarter of rebar.

It is a relatively traditional nitrogen. Then add an increase in wages. Wages are tax-free. So the third quarter is relatively comparable. Then it is compared to the previous year.

That figure is near. Last year, the fourth quarter. The total sales volume was 420,000 tons. Compared to the third quarter of last year, it was an increase of 10%. That was then compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year.

Last year, the steel industry. It was probably always. Rebar 98,000 tonnes. About 11% increase. Rebar 98,000 tonnes.

That's 980,000 tonnes of steel. It's probably not much of a change. It's a five-year sales situation. We'll see. 2021 is our company.

That's a total of 1.6 million tonnes, and last year it was 161 million tonnes, so we said it wasn't too much of a change.

This part of the report was first announced, so there are a few simple figures that are: earnings per share was 1.5% from last quarter last year, which was an increase of 0.33 from the third quarter, which was roughly the same as the fourth quarter of the previous year. In the previous year, net profit per share after 2024 was $4.26, which was probably a slight increase from the previous year, to 0.18. So yesterday the board of directors also made further progress through this step, which is to further progress, this is the progress that is to be made, is to allocate $3.5 of cash incentives, which is the same as last year's level.

First of all, let's look at the current situation of the steel industry, we see a production economy of steel, we can see that in 2024 the overall steel output of 1.83 billion million, which was about a half-year decrease, but the main decrease of the mainland China about 1.7%, almost 10 million people. If the Chinese mainland factors are taken away, in fact, the global steel output of last year is about equal.

The World Steel Association believes that the demand for iron and steel is likely to rise gradually this year. Of course, the demand for iron and steel is likely to rise, which is likely to take away his progress, but his current development is still strong. But another variable is that the U.S. deepens the tariff, the impact of this entire iron and steel is to be observed, and of course, this should have an immediate positive impact on the local situation in the U.S., and the standards of these countries will not change, which is another long-term tracking variable.

We see the trend of raw materials, the blue iron ore sand last year was about $140, and then fell to the end of the last $99, that year so far about 106, 108, there is a return of news. The part of the waste steel is about May 2024, to the end of 360, so the change of waste steel is also falling, but its decline is different from iron ore sand last year, the price of iron ore sand fell about 29%, so the price of this connection includes the price of the products, in the last year the price of the furnace is really competitive, so there will be some relevant analysis behind it.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged in chronological order into paragraphs.

First, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a continuous problem with the timestamp. For example, there may be jumps between timestamps, for example, from [1024. 32-1025. 32] to [1027. 32], the content is missing in the middle [1025. 32-1027. 32]. However, depending on the data provided by the user, these timestamps may be correct, just in the middle of nothing.

These contents should be organized together in a consistent manner, forming a paragraph that indicates a decrease in supply but an increase in exports, reflecting the needs of the body. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the user mentioned "not to delete, rewrite, condensate any original text", which means that even if some sentences look duplicated or inconsistent, the "body" in the user's reference "the degree of body required for it" may be a mistake, but according to the user's request, no modifications can be made, can only be retained as it is.

In addition, the user's transcription has some time between stamps, such as a few seconds between [1099. 321-1102. 32] and [1105. 32-1107. 32], which may mean that the speaker has to pause or skip something here. However, according to the data provided by the user, these spaces have no content, so it is necessary to keep it as it was during the conversion without adding anything. When dealing with the export section, the user mentions the import and export situation in Taiwan, including the reduction of waste steel imports, and the increase in minor combinations, etc. These content need to be arranged in the order of time stamps and ensure that each data point is presented correctly. For example, the amount of waste steel import is reduced by 12.4%, and the small combination is increased by 4.3%, which must be preserved accurately.

In addition, the user mentioned that the surface consumption of crystals remained high, and the H-shaped steel imports increased by 24.8%, all of which need to be clearly expressed in the paragraphs while maintaining the original order and content of the sentence. In handling the second half of the import changes, the user mentioned that China's steel prices reached a new low in September, leading to price differences and thus affecting the import volume.

At the same time, to ensure that the transition between paragraphs of nature, is consistent with the flow of speech expression, but does not change the original intention. After the initial draft, I will check the corresponding sentences of each timestamp again to confirm that the order is correct, the content is completely correct.

It is not only the large export of its finished products, it has grown by 101.3% per month. The reason is that we are the same as in 2023, and this increase is quite large. The reason is the same with me, in fact, the advantages of high agricultural raw materials, coupled with its large differences in supply and demand, so it is also your export guide to decomposition of its products, so we all show the numbers here. The import part of the import is inevitable is reduced, so the reason is the same as just reported, the internal difference.

In the first half of 2024, the demand for steel is still there, but because the drop of steel is less than high-watts of steel sand and coal, so the competitive advantage of small-matching competition has a price advantage, so Taiwan also imported more small-matched to get some of the scrap steel. The H-shaped steel has grown about 24.8%, which is probably the situation of the price difference between the import and the domestic price, the import volume is relatively large, compared to the 2022 year is also double. Then we see the disc, the 14 mile and the 14 mile magnetic bar, which is related to our industrial use, steel stone hand tools are more relevant.

Of course, this is the situation to the fourth quarter, because it looks like the import volume is relatively reduced, but it is a sales policy for our domestic steel mills, the price of a certain part of the effect, so we included steel in our company in the last third quarter of last year's release price has done some corresponding reduction, not for this reason, the current downward price has remained stable until now. Well, let's take a look at the export, because the domestic price of the international steel price is falling, of course, the price of the export competition pressure is relatively large, so we can say that it is obvious that it is falling, but because the domestic price advantage is not like some of the mainland China or some of the oil and water plants in Southeast Asia, so the export volume is about a slight drop. Next we see the effect of the decline of the following year, but it is a new trend of the following year, and the trend is not a new trend, but it is not a new trend, it is a new trend, but it is not a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, but it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is not a new trend, but the year after the year, it is also a new trend, it is a new trend, but the trend, it is also a new trend, it is also a new trend, it is a new trend, it is also a new trend, it is not a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is not a new trend, but it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, but it is a new trend, but the year, it is not a new trend, but it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is a new trend, it is 7%, of course, the heat of the construction industry in the market feels a little need to cool a little after regional dialing controls, but you see the area of this decomposition is actually after 2023.

The fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter, the construction of the first quarter compared to the first quarter, YoY, the area of the construction license, the body volume grew 13 people, the third quarter is about 10, so it compared to the previous quarter compared to the fourth quarter, it is a positive. We also want to look at one, this no information on the above, the new area of the plant, the increase is about 0.2% compared to the previous year, the fourth quarter increased by 12. 6%, the fourth quarter of the new construction YOY also increased by 5. 2%, the third quarter of the QOQ compared to the decline by 13%. So just look at the fourth quarter YOY, the construction and the new start of the new work, the demand for the steel machine should be supported.

This is a data of the footprint. We just said that the fourth quarter is a data of a change in this number, it grew with the last year, it grew 13 branches with the fourth quarter of 2023. This is the most important statistics, I just reported it in 2023 and 2024 on the impact of watch sales, in fact, no, not complete, summarized its relevant point changes.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, when the price is going to go down, it will go up, so the positive incentives of the market should be relatively good. In the fourth quarter of 2023, when the price is going down, it will inevitably lead to the customer's expected psychology, so it will be less, so we think there is a concept. Then we see our market share, our market share in the year, the year last year is 14%, the fourth quarter is 14.4%, so the market share is small, slightly increased.

But the U.S. tax down, a local price in the United States, very fast, the licensing, for example, the heat pressure, about the end of January to February, to this time, about a month up, 80 to 90 million dollars, so this is a, that such a finished product, the play also led to a, the cost of raw materials, the cost of the beginning of a raw material, the sample of raw materials, so it also led to our, just in December this year, it has a significant price, up here there there is a 0.6, a price rose.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence must be kept as it is, but needs to be condensed in a paragraph format that is readable.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the general structure and theme of the content. It looks like this section involves some market analysis, price changes, company strategy, and announcements of land redevelopment in the steel industry. Next, I need to identify the start timestamp of each sentence and make sure that no sentence is missing during the conversion process. Next, I need to determine how to properly segment.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the sequence of sentences is correct and not disrupting the original timeline. During the processing process, I will check the sequence to make sure that each sentence is properly placed in the paragraph. For example, the beginning part discusses the relationship between gold and precious metal, then the price changes, then the customer sentiment changes, then turns to the market trend of scrap steel and finished products, and finally the announcement about land reconstruction.

The process of changing customer sentiment from pessimism to optimism may require a separate segment to highlight emotional changes. When dealing with the land reconstruction part, multiple relevant sentences need to be combined into paragraphs to illustrate the land location, holding status, reconstruction process, and the sale plan.

In addition, pay special attention to the format of the timestamps correctly, to ensure that the timestamps in the converted paragraphs are consistent with the original content. For example, [1971. 32-1973. 32] Along with that, it is necessary to keep the original text intact without modification. Finally, I will read through the entire converted paragraph script, check if there are missing sentences, make sure that all the contents are properly integrated, and that the transition between paragraphs is natural, logical.

In addition, the processing of timestamps needs to be precise to avoid confusion. In summary, I need to systematically group each sentence by logic and subject matter to form paragraphs while strictly complying with user requirements, without modifying or deleting any content, to ensure that the final result both conforms to formatting requirements and maintains the original integrity. [1971. 32-1973. 32] With. [1973. 32-1975. 32] Especially steel. [1975. 32-1977. 32]

[1977. 32-1979. 32] Although the steel is stable, it is trendy. [1979. 32-1981. 32] With the change is also declining. [1981. 32-1983. 32] Last February. [1983. 32-1985. 32] The steel increased by 600 as the fee just increased. [1985. 32-1987. 32] The steel also increased by 500. [1987. 32-1989. 32] The steel increased by 400.

[1989. 32-1991. 32] Now the condition is after last year. [1991. 32-1993. 32] August fall. [1993. 32-1995. 32] The price has not changed so far. [1997. 32-1999. 32] That's why it hasn't changed. [1999. 32-2001. 32] Because the condition after all its downstream customer is. [2001. 32-2003. 32] The export is mainly.

[2003. 32-2005. 32] is the category of the Rosemary. [2005. 32-2007. 32] hand tools. [2007. 32-2009. 32] is actually international. [2009. 32-2011. 32] peer in competition. [2011. 32-2013. 32] competition. [2013. 32-2015. 32] means that it must be related to the stoves.

[2015. 32-2017. 32] Furnace raw materials have competition. [2017. 32-2019. 32] So its price reaction. [2019. 32-2021. 32] The reaction to the mainland price. [2021. 32-2023. 32] is actually relevant. [2023. 32-2025. 32] The current look. [2025. 32-2023. 32] The steel price is about the other side of the mainland.

[2027. 32-2029. 32] There is little change in the conditions here. [2029. 32-2031. 32] There is no immediate adjustment. [2031. 32-2033. 32] The price. [2033. 32-2035. 32] But it does not adjust the price. [2035. 32-2037. 32] But at. [2037. 32-2039. 32] U.S. steel and aluminum tax.

[2039. 32-2041. 32] There is also a war of oolongs. [2041. 32-2043. 32] may be shortened. [2043. 32-2045. 32] or soon enough. [2045. 32-2047. 32] Takes one. [2047. 32-2049. 32] Expected. [2049. 32-2041. 32] At least the customer is here.

[2051. 32-2053. 32] There is an emotion here. [2053. 32-2055. 32] appears to be from pessimism. [2055. 32-2057. 32] Slowly a little bit. [2057. 32-2059. 32] Change. [2059. 32-2061. 32] The pessimism is slightly optimistic. [2061. 32-2063. 32] This is not so.

[2063. 32-2065. 32] The pessimistic mood. [2065. 32-2067. 32] Here is one. [2067. 32-2069. 32] The price hasn't changed. [2069. 32-2071. 32] But. [2071. 32-2073. 32] The atmosphere of its price is still a little change. [2073. 32-2077. 32] Let's look at it.

[2077. 32-2079. 32] Mostly us. [2079. 322081. 32] One of the scrap steel and finished products. [2081. 322083. 32] Market trend. [2083. 32-2085. 32] I just reported. [2085. 32-2087. 32] That is. [2087. 32-2089. 32] Although the scrap steel.

[2095. 32-2091. 32] and the finished product are all falling. [2091. 32-2093. 32] But we are in the three products. [2093. 32-2095. 32] In the stage of the raw materials fall. [2095. 32-2097. 32] It is a little different. [2097. 32-2099. 32] We look at the price directly. [2099. 32-2101. 32] We see the price.

[2110. 32-2103. 32] This year we rebar. [2103. 32-2105. 32] The spread is about to be locked in. [2105. 32-2107. 32] 8. 8 [2107. 32-2109. 32] That is 9. 2. [2109. 32-2111. 32] So it is still there. [2111. 32-2113. 32] Raw material changes. [2113. 32-2115. 32] Then it is moderate.

[2115. 32-2117. 32] Responds to the rise of some other costs. [2117. 32-2119. 32] So it has a price difference. [2119. 32-2121. 32] developed. [212121. 32-2123. 32] The portion of the row steel. [2123. 32-2125. 32] Row steel. [2125. 32-2127. 32] Parts from 15. 1.

[2127. 32-2129. 32] becomes 15. 7. [2129. 32-2131. 32] is achieved with this effect. [2131. 32-2133. 32] The lines 15. 7 to 15. 9. [2133. 32-2135. 32] This is a relatively small change. [2135. 32-2137. 32] But it is still achieved. [2137. 32-2139. 32] So.

[2139. 32-2141. 32] Our company's current situation. [2141. 32-2143. 32] Approximately. [2143. 32-2145. 32] The raw material is, of course, international. [2145. 32-2147. 32] The market is formed with tools. [2147. 32-2149. 32] We are the price of the three products. [2149. 32-21151. 32] Policy as far as possible.

[2151. 32-2115. 32] To achieve substantial response costs. [2153. 32-2115. 32] to be appropriate. [2155. 32-2115. 32] To respond to raw material cost is moderate. [2157. 32-2159. 32] To respond to other production costs. [2159. 32-2116. 32] So it looks like this. [2161. 32-2163. 32] is valid.

[2163. 32-2165. 32] That's it. [2165. 32-2167. 32] This is my report. [2167. 32-2169. 32] This is the one. [2169. 32217. 32] This is the one. [2171. 32-2173. 32] We are the first to request. [2173. 32-2175. 32]

[2175. 32-2177. 32] Let's talk about it. [2177. 32-2179. 32] We put it. [2179. 322181. 32] Board of Directors. [2181. 32-2183. 32] Board of Directors. [2183. 32-2185. 32] Message. [2185. 32-2187. 32] That's what our Board of Directors was yesterday.

[2187. 32-2193. 32] When the Board of Directors was present. [2189. 322191. 32] There was an announcement of a major message and perhaps. [2191. 322193. 32] Yes. [2191. 322195. 32] Because I thought it was. [2195. 322197. 32] The number of people asked is higher. [2197. 32-2199. 32] So I listed it in this meeting.

[2199. 32-2201.32] Additional explanation. [2201. 32-2203. 32] Maybe because of the board of directors' meeting yesterday. [2203. 32-2205. 32] The announcement message compares. [2205. 32-2207. 32] It's late. [2207 32-2209. 32] So no questions have been asked at this time. [2209. 32-2211. 32]

[2211. 32-2213. 32] Yesterday's announcement was mainly to say. [2213. 32-2215. 32] We had a piece in Hsinchu. [2215. 32-2217. 32] Land. [2217. 32-2219. 32] I was following about thirty landlords. [2219. 32-2221. 32] That.

[2223. 32-2225. 32] Our company. [2225. 32-2227. 32] The shareholding held by [2227. 32-2229. 32] is probably twenty-three. [2229. 32-2231. 32] Close to twenty-four percent. [2231. 32-2233. 32] This is the one that is full of potential. [2233. 32-2235. 32] It is close to twenty-four percent.

[2235. 32-2237. 32] That is the present it. [2237. 32-2239. 32] That piece of land. [2239. 32-2241. 32] We have about from the Republic of China. [2241. 32-2243. 32] Almost eighty years. [2243. 32-2245. 32] It is now owned. [2245. 32-2247. 32] So it is actually that.

[2247. 32-2249. 32] is a lot of value added. [2249. 32225. 32] then. [2251. 322253. 32] A few years ago we had it. [2253. 32-2255. 32] It was the doctor's area. [2255. 32-2257. 32] It had one. [2257. 32]

This is the land in Hsinchu City that is relatively large, so they decided to adopt a public bidding method. Then the landlord, on the other hand, is to find three, is to find a few companies to report. Then the last decision is to be made by the municipal council to do this exclusive sale. That's because the land is said to be more valuable, so we say that before signing, we are in accordance with the provisions of the deposit, there is something that has been passed on the board, so it is also according to the relevant provisions.

Well, we can ask you questions, see if you have any questions you can ask the assistants. You still don't knock yer, ihad. We can publish our own announcement, you go to Guago advanced, there is no problem to ask the question. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'd like to ask you first, because you just said that there is a better atmosphere of the free war market, which in particular is a little more optimistic about the customer's price or how, this can be explained more specifically, thank you. Because I should use the sales situation to explain, this is the part of the condition.

This is not just a steel plant, even downstream orders are probably in a relatively bearish state, so of course this is reflected in the status of the order is a little different. However, this February after Mr. Trump Shanghai's departure from tax and innocence war, it is obvious that our order was a change in a year before and after a certain change in the feeling that he had received a little rebound. So if you say how much he rebounded, I probably can only tell you that the patient who was originally in a lower order was in an increase in the number of patients, that the specific increase in the number of people I'm sorry to say, basically he has made you feel that the first line of salespeople feel that the whole situation has changed. I can only say that the price part of the price has changed, because the price in mainland China has not yet changed.

This kind of incentives to the market will be more correct, so I think, in particular, the bridge county, in fact, he is facing the biggest problem of China's supply and demand fisheries, and his export policy, which is the place to observe. The band I just reported, the United States just received tax, Japan Korea has tax allowances, the United States now has become a full-fledged equal, he will not turn to Asia, Southeast Asia here, this is also pay attention. So it should be said that there are many empty conditions, just look at the current, the atmosphere is more obvious.

This is, I don't see who's problem, or I look at life, the steel conditions in 2025 demand to see the price, the second reconstruction needs to be specific assessment. The first rebar demand, now I just look like I have to respect the so-called construction, the area of the construction license, he looks like he or the floor area, or he is showing positive, so I can't say to use his own feelings to say that pessimistic or optimistic, but his data tell me that he or she is higher than 2023, so I don't have any reason to see the lightening.

The second reconstruction needs to be evaluated, in fact, I report to you that after all, it is assumed that the direct steel to go from Asia to there is actually a long way to go, so you have to be straight to determine whether domestic manufacturers can play this role, but the international steel demand is flowing, the steel price is also changing due to demand flow, so even if you are not directly involved in this reconstruction, it indirectly compensates some of the steel needs of the reconstruction country, this will be linked, so it is not necessary to care about how much you are involved in reconstructing the steel, but the whole steel demand flow and confidence to build this is important, above the answer to the question.

And of course, the second we've come a long way from South America, Central America, and Japan, and then Japan, he's subject to steel and aluminum tax, then maybe his production here will not be affected, if he is affected, it is not just the cost of this place is more space, this is also a change, so he really is in the United States, you have to worry about whether he can worry, right?

However, there may be different expressions here in Japan. Therefore, there is no way to estimate a change throughout the year. Just say that the two countries may be possible. This may be a very different expression.

Not necessarily. That's my description. Do you think we sell to the U.S. or to Canada?

I will give you an account of what I have given you, and what I have given you, and what you have given me, and what you have given me, and what you have given me, and what you have given me, and what you have given me, and what you have given me.

This time, the steel and aluminum tax is particularly special, he added downstream products. The addition of this is not all. The addition of this is the screw plus cap. This screw plus cap was added. That is, before March, the screw plus cap was sold to the United States. He has a fixed tariff.

After March.
