<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's verbatim text and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim fragments provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

However, according to the user's request, it is not possible to add or remove anything, so it is necessary to keep the existing sentence even if there is a jump in the middle. During the processing process, I will sort through a sentence to make sure that each sentence appears in chronological order and without omissions. At the same time, pay attention to the coherence between sentences, it may be necessary to adjust the punctuation or add a link to the sentence, but the user explicitly requests not to change the content, so it can only be adjusted without changing the original intention. For example, some sentences may start with "that", which may be common in spoken language, but may need to be adjusted in written, but the user requests do not change, so it must be retained.

In addition, it is important to note that duplicated parts, such as [352. 14-352. 58], are repeated several times in a row "that's entirely 18%", which may be due to duplicated in the original. At the same time, some sentences may be wrong words or syntax errors, but the user requests that do not modify the content, so they can only keep the original. In the process, it is also important to pay attention to the corresponding timestamp to ensure that each sentence is properly placed in the paragraph. For example, some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, but the timestamp shows that there is an interval between them, at which time it is necessary to determine whether they belong to the same topic and whether they need to merge into a consistent paragraph.

Make sure you don't add any extra information or delete any sentences that are fully compatible with the user's requirements. </think> [paragraph verbatim]: Please feel free to like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots column.

That first quarter revenue was 88. 58, which was an increase of 6.04 percent compared to the same period last year. The main reason for that increase was the growth of that speaker's business. The speaker grew 16 percent compared to the same period last year. The gross profit for the first quarter was 10.95 billion, which was 45 million more than the same period last year.

So the gross profit YY is an increase of 4.29 percent. That gross profit margin is 12.36, which is 0.21 percentage points compared to the same period last year. This is mainly due to two reasons, the first reason is of course affected by the product portfolio. The second reason is that we have a large number of gross profit margins in the first quarter, which is relatively low.

It has some quality problems, so there is some work, which also leads to a decrease in the gross profit margin of the product line. But the problem has been resolved at this time, and the gross profit margin of the product will return to a normal level after April. So the gross profit margin of the product is more likely to be improved.

That's because we have a lot of new cases in the second half of this year. That's because we have a lot of contacts, so we've added a lot of people in the second half of that RD, mainly in Taiwan. That's why we're going to go to Singapore, India, and that's where we, our Qingdao, and even our Shenzhen, all have more people in the second half of this year.

That's why this part of the cost increase is also a factor. That's when the product is migrated, those things will be a bit less expensive. But for this new 2026 case, a new product from 2027, that part of the research and development will be more and more invested. That's because it's now invested, and the revenue hasn't yet been shown, so we see that the cost rate is relatively high.

The business interest rate is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 1. 18%, that is 18%.

That's one of the main reasons why out-of-the-box revenue increases. That's why the net profit attributed to the parent company was $3.53 billion, which was $1.42 in the first quarter, which was 0.28 compared to the same period last year. Then let's take a look at one of our main product categories, which is divided into headphone speakers and others.

That uh, in the product category, uh, compared to the same time last year, that uh is a decrease of 6%, which is mainly due to the decline of gaming headsets. That speaker increased by 16% compared to the same time last year, which was mainly from the headset class NV, as well as the speaker of this phone, as well as a growth of HiFi such uh sound. The other part of the other part is increased by 52%, which is mainly from the product of the microphone class, as well as the growth of this medical product. So, the ratio of revenue for the uh product in the first quarter, uh is 61%, uh is 30%, and the other part is 9%.

This is why the percentage of speakers is increased. The percentage of speakers is increased from 27% to 30 percentage points, and the percentage is increased by 3 percentage points. The percentage is also increased from 6 percentage points to 9 percentage points, the main reason is this category, which is 52 percentage points from the same period last year. However, the percentage is decreased by 6 percentage points, so the percentage is increased.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph verb: Well, let's take a look at the condition of this headset class. It's a condition of that subclass. Well, that compares to the same period last year.

That's right, there's this entertainment user here. It's business and business. Well, that business earphones are a little weaker than last year. So the reduction of audio earphones is mostly this business earphones are weaker. That's the high level of this entertainment speculation or growth is still stable.

That's the part of gaming. uh, it was a 29 percent reduction compared to the same period last year. Well, yeah. The main reason is that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

So this year's first quarter compared to last year's first quarter will have a relatively large reduction. The other part of the TWS is a growth of 33 percent compared to last year's. So the main reason is because we have a new customer compared to the same period last year.

Another one is an old customer with a new model. That's why TWS is growing compared to last year. That's why the sales share of each product line of this machine is still maintained at 58%. The part of gaming is just mentioned. It's a 29% decrease compared to last year.

So Gaming's share decreased from 27% to 20%. Then TWS's share grew by 33%. So its share increased from 15% to 20% last year. So let's take a look at what a speaker is doing this year.

Then, compared to the same period last year, Speaker was 16% growth. Then we divide it into speakers for mobile phones. Then there is the speaker for computers. Then the speaker for computers contains a desktop computer. A computer with a laptop. Then there are other categories.

So in the case of this speaker. Let's take a look at the situation of the speaker. Other categories are mostly speakers for this type of headphones. There is also a loud sound like this Hi-Fi. Then the portion of the phone is 12% higher than the same period last year.

The one who wants to be a part of this world, the one who wants to be a part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, the one who wants to be part of it, and the one who wants to be part of it.

So the lower part is a larger one. So the speaker of this phone will grow by 12%. Then the computer class is 33% compared to last year's increase. Then the main thing is to come from an increase in the delivery of the speaker of this laptop. Then the other class has a larger one. Then the parts of these classes are increased by 12%.

That comes from the earphones. There is a growth of this high-fidelity sound. So it is in the low level. Our phone uses a percentage of the speaker. That's up to 50%. Then the part of the computer is 20%.

Then we look at this balance sheet. Then, the balance sheet. The number of days we will be in charge of the balance sheet is reduced by four days from the previous quarter.

One of the occupations is a decrease compared to the previous quarter. So the fourth quarter's revenue will be better. So his fourth quarter's revenue will be collected in the first quarter. So that's a day of revenue. That's a four-day decrease. The number of stock turnovers increased 24 days from the previous quarter.

So, because of the second quarter. The second quarter's revenue is better than the first quarter. So, because of the second quarter's revenue is better.

So the number of days in the first quarter increased by 24 days compared to the previous quarter. Then the number of days to deal with the suspension increased by 29 days compared to the previous quarter. Well, that's because you want to stock up. So the number of days to give to that supplier is a longer day. So that's why.

That's it. That's an increase in the percentage of suppliers who regularly pay the weather. So that's it. The number of days that are payable is higher than the previous quarter. So that's why. The entire CCC is a 9-day decrease in cash turnover from the previous quarter.

Well, that's where the main liquidity is. That's when cash comes to 109.17 billion. Then the receivables part is 81.75 billion. Then the inventory part is 57.32 million. Then the liquidity part is that.

So the main reason for this is because. Our Board of Directors has a resolution. To which is added the incentives for 2024. So, that's why.

The current liabilities are much more than the previous quarter. Then we look at the cash flow part. So what is the quarter. One cash flow of that business activity is 28.81 million. Then the capital expenditure part is 2.2 billion 8800. Then the capital expenditure is 1.98 billion.

So the main reason for that is that 1.98 billion. Now we are not. Are we going to move the capacity to the Vietnam and the other Thailand? Then Thailand has a joint project with that U2 plant. Then the new one is being built. Then the U2 plant together.

Now everyone is about to cover up a little. Then the erotic decoration is in progress. Then the subsequent machine equipment will start casting. Then we expect to be able to join the production in the fourth quarter. So that's the erotic thing. Now there will be some erotic plants.

Then there are some capital expenditures on the equipment. Then there is the other one, uh Vietnam. Then his plant is all of the early days covered. Well, that's it. Because there are some models of uh, there are some equipment.

An investment. So there will be such a capital expenditure as $1.98 billion. So a free cash flow during this period is uh. The inflow is 26.83 billion. Then, uh. Then, uh. Let's report it.

April 24 is an earnings report for the first quarter of the Board's announcement. Well, so the next major time is May 26. Well, we're going to have to hold our that uh shareholders' Chamber of Commerce.

Then on July 24th. Then we'll announce our second season of a financial report. Then we'll also report it to you. That's what the company is doing in esg right now. So we're going to erg at the end of the year.

That's the kind of equality we're going to get from this company.

I have a lot of money on my RDR because we have these RDRs, and it's very little to spend on them.

All of that is the amount of the tax rate of the odm-crying company in Taiwan. All of that is the amount of the odm-crying rate of the odm-crying company in Taiwan. All of that is the amount of the odm-crying rate of the odm-crying company in Taiwan.

The ship is covered by insurance, customs clearance, all of which are borne by the customer. So this is the business condition. Tariff is the customer to deal with. The first such stock to be pulled in. We want to control within a month.

That means I will have more inventory. That means revenues are growing in the next month or the next quarter. That means a lot more revenue in the second quarter than in the first quarter. Of course, that tariff.

It's not tariffs. That's what we see a few phenomena. That's what the customer's needs are. There may be an increase in the demand. We also see some goods.

Our goods are stock of one item. Our goods are stock of one item. So we will have some stock of our own. And we also think of some of these. There are some chips. This is the cycle.

It is possible to go back to this situation that may be out of stock. So some of us will be in heaven. We will also have a little bit of preparation. So it is to answer this question. The first is mainly because I have a good income. So my inventory is increased.

The second reason is because we think that the customer also has an upside, so there are some key. It's not the kind of material that's more critical. We also have a little bit more to prepare.

We think it is possible to miss out. We also have a little bit of preparation. The investment is advanced and wants to ask another question. When will the acquisition of MWT's plan be delivered? The company currently has about one year of revenue.

The delivery time of MWH should fall in the third quarter. That is, it should be base on. It is the approval of the competent authority in each place. Of course, including Taiwan's approval.

It was the company's revenue in 2023. It was about four billion dollars. It was probably the number in 2024. Or some growth.

About the MWT part. Investment advanced want to ask. Mets Suzhou part of the revenue less than 5%. But the net profit doubled. That's why. Whether the net interest rate is going to sustain sustainable growth.

Less than 5% of revenue. Uh, you should say that it grows less than 5%. Or less than 5%. This part I'm not quite sure. But the part that increases its net profit is the main part. I just have to say.

That. uh. it it it it it it it it it the customer has a pre-loading lot. That customer has pre-loading. That is basically uh. Suzhou Metit it is automated production.

So that's it. If the revenue increases, that's it. The profit margin will be much better. So it's a bit like a large-scale economy.

That's why it's uh growth. That's why the net interest rate for that one is increasing a lot. The net interest rate for that part won't last.

However, in the first quarter of this year's revenue situation, it is not the first half of this year's mobile phone talent ratio will be higher. uh I just said. The first quarter of the mobile phone's revenue ratio is higher because of the reason.

Because he may have realized that he has tariffs, so this kind of assembly factory is a little bit more larder. After that, it will not be reduced. This is not sure that doing bad his pull is due to the fact that not because of the tariff problem.

That's it. That's a phony phone. That's the trend that doesn't change the proportion of speakers. Because the more we do, the more our other product categories will be. The phony contains the flat tablet just talked about. That's the first half of the year to start shipping.

Now it's time to ship. That amount will start. The more you do next year, the more you do it. So the proportion of the tablet will increase. So the proportion of speaker for the phone will decrease.

That's probably how much the proportion of raw materials from Thailand and Vietnam is coming from. The proportion of raw materials from Thailand and Vietnam should be like this. That is, if the electronic material is not from China, most of it is not from China.

It may be designed in the United States or in Taiwan. Then this head may be in Taiwan. It may also be in China. Yes. Package most may be in Malaysia. So if that is the case.

IC class electronic class. It may be from all over the world. That kind of plastic metal could be from China. That kind of packaging class may be local. So if it is in Vietnam to buy Vietnam is Vietnam.

Or, if it is in the land of the living, then it is in the land of the living, and it is in the land of the dead, then it is in the land of the living, and it is in the land of the living.

PCV board factory. It has arrived in Thailand. So later PCV. It may be Thailand local workers. So there are a lot of plastic facilities. It is already in Vietnam and Thailand local.

So plastic installation is possible, part of the IC, it may not be possible, from that global, but.

The demand for the second quarter will rise. Will the revenue of the second quarter be closer to the level in the second half of last year. Well, I don't think.

It is very difficult to say last year, that is, the demand increase I want to do, then the current problem is that everyone needs to increase, so we will expect a situation, it may be missing, that there may be a lack of work, so that is, if everything goes well, then he will be very good, if that said, if there will be a shortage of work, that is, the revenue will be better than the original, expected better, but this will not be as much as the customer wants, the investment advanced, the second quarter has to ask, there will be a large amount of revenue contribution, then, under 2025, the third quarter of revenue QOQOQ, I think this is to look at the status of the tariff, this is difficult to talk about, the second half is not to talk about, then we will talk to the customer will talk about, then the current capacity is mainly out of that the US, the 90 days, the US, the big deal with the US. The above is the question of the current QA, look at the investment advanced and no other problems, President Hello, is the rich official company of Kevin, want to ask you about the future, because you have mentioned that there are a lot of R&D investment, you can talk about 26 and 27 look, if you think that in the direction of the big product category, we will later see these cases, resulting in what kind of adjustment of the company's product structure, that in the next two or three years, you feel that these R&D projects will bring what effect, in fact, we have many years of these years is scattered, the so-called dispersion market, dispersion, then dispersion of product line, dispersion capacity, that dispersion market, that, we have previously made customers are mainly Europe and the US customers, so why we will buy the MWH, because he is a large Japanese market, there is, there are some Australia, or other places, we are in the efforts, and we are working in the effort, but the efforts, but the next, but the next, but the new customers, the new customers, the next time, the new customers, the new customers, the new customers, the customer is the new product, the product, the product is that is a lot of the customer is the new product, the product, the same, the product is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is a lot of the customer is that is that is that is that is that is the new product is that is that is a lot of the customer is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is In 26 years, there will be a relatively large growth, that is, after you do a new product, that is, after you do a new product, the third case, the extent of that new product is more than the new product, that you do the first case is much simpler, then the next is the dispersion of that capacity, because we have China has five factories, and then there is Vietnam has one, that Thailand has a, that just said that we are the first half of this year, or the other 70% of China, in fact, this, in the past years, this weight is even lower, but after our years of a slow effort, I believe that next year, it should be about 5, or even China may fall below the five-fifth, that just mentioned this is the United States, or the other place, so we will go to a prudent assessment, so it is just said that the cost is the next time, if it is the next time is the next time is the next time, if you will be the next time, if the next time is the most international trade trade fair, if it will be more than the same, if you will not the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next time, the next time, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next time, the next time, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the next time, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, sorting them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription provided by the user in a few sentences, paying attention to the timestamp and the content.

First of all, I will identify different topics or issues. For example, the previous sentences discuss the impact of medium-sized customers, capacity dispersion, and economies of scale, followed by the prospect of gross profit margins and profit margins, and then the cost comparison of different production bases. After that, the outlook for gross profit margins and product gross profit margins in the second quarter, and finally the thank-you portion of the cost difference between each plant and the end of the meeting.

For example, there is a small interval between [3411. 08-3411. 36] and [3411. 38-3415. 88], but the content is coherent and should be merged into the same paragraph. Similarly, some sentences may appear uncoherent due to mistakes or duplication, but must remain as they are. During the processing process, I also need to pay attention to the correct use of punctuation and formatting to ensure that the paragraphs are separated by line breaks, sentences or commas, but the user does not have a specific requirement for the punctuation, so it may need to remain the same.

In addition, the user's example has some time-stamped sentences separated and needs to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the whole paragraph verb, check whether all the original sentences are properly preserved, no omissions or errors, and the paragraphs are logically clear. Make sure that no additional content is added and execute exactly as the user's requirements. </think>

In the future, if more long-term companies such as small and medium-sized customers, may be more biased to small and medium-sized customers, at the same time, more production base, more economic scale efficiency may not be so high. Do you think the Group's freight rate, interest rate, regardless of the direction of gross profit rate or profitability, how can we imagine it in the next few years?

But the problem is that the small customer also becomes a big customer, not that he is small, just that he gives to you at the beginning, and we have a lot of customers who are also small to do big. The other is that the current customer of Cook, not all small customers. I just talked about the Japanese market customer, he is a large quantity, as long as we do what we do, succeed in the order of success, that he is also a big customer.

The cost of the direct labor included in my so-called cost is the cost of this engine. You go to other places that are smaller than him, but his direct labor may be lower, that one, that one, the cost may be lower. So a lot of factors combined, we are still looking for the increase in the amount of the profit.

Well, yeah, that's what I'm talking about in the second quarter. That's why it's hard to tell you what a gross profit rate will be in the second quarter. That's why the first thing I'm talking about is that the growth of the second quarter comes from this uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So the second quarter of gross margin should be better than the first quarter, so that he is based on this erotic exchange rate, which is the same water level. Now because of the erotic trade war, good tariff war, the recent exchange rate fluctuation is a little bit more, so the exchange rate may also be a variable of the future gross margin. The investment advanced want to ask about each product's gross margin. Well now, if I split the earphone with the other erotic, in the speaker, the headphone's gross margin is the highest, the other is the second, the erotic part is the worst.

Thank you for your time and effort. Today we are very grateful for sharing with President Huang. Today, we will take this step forward, thank you for your investment in advanced participation. Thank you for your understanding.
