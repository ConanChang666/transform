We know about our base motor. One of the effects of a division. It is a great energy. So we have the base motor division. The mastering of the base motor is how. Thank you.

Thank you. Come on. One of the effects of this department of radio power is a great energy. The capacity of radio power is a subsidies. One of the subsidies of electric power. The plan to connect them to radio is to.

Last year's plan for 10 years. They were about to complete it up to 6 years in advance. Put some of it in front of the section about electricity consumption. It was done up to 6 years in advance. So he is up to it now. He is also tightening that speed to execute.

We have a lot of energy for this debate. But the outcome of this ruling. We have no impact on this unit. We have this year. This unit this year. We seem to be pretty much the same as last year's production.

We've had quite a bit of a run-up to last year, thank you.

I also want to ask. Because I look at the department of loss, in fact, the two losses are in decline. So I don't know how we're going to lose the entire department of visit this year. Is it possible to continue to reduce the losses?

That's a mistake. That's another thing we're going to do this year. I'm also going to figure out how to do it. I'm going to explain this here. The two years since we're going to go to the department, we've been making changes to the product line.

So there are some effects. That's what I'm going to talk about this year. That's the same thing that's still adjusting these lines. There will be some effects gradually, so it looks like this year should be a better outlook and bounce than last year.

That report is a question I want to ask again. It should be done. Some tariff issues in the United States. I don't know what's in one of the above schemes.

Thank you. The first one will have an impact. But in the case of Yanghua Optoelectronics Department, we ship directly from Vietnam or Taiwan to the United States. At present, the ratio is relative. But what we do is either touchpanel or monitor.

This is ours, and they may be assembled together to the machine, or monitor, etc. Because some of them have guests, or some of them will be sold to the United States, which is the fastest impact.

There is currently no actual assessment available. However, it can be determined. **Please note:** **Please note:** **Please note:**. **Please note:**

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcript:. The current situation of the customer is not said, because the problem was changed a few days ago immediately. This is a description of the current situation for the U.S. tariffs, the impact on Yanghua Optoelectronics Department.

If you want to ask, you want to ask. If you don't know if you can ask, you want to ask. If you don't know if you can ask, you want to ask. If you can't answer, Chen wants to ask.

It is said that the former loss, Chen Minghao wanted to talk about it. Or the loss rate, Chen Minghao wants to talk about it. There is no smaller, Chen Minghao wants to talk about it. Then, in addition, Chen Minghao wants to talk about it.

This is the end, Chen Ming-hao wants to ask. The end, Chen Ming-hao wants to tell. There is no output, Chen Ming-hao wants to tell. This is the last year more, Chen Ming-hao wants to tell. Thank you. Let me explain today, the situation of optoelectronics.

This year's light, photoelectric condition. Light, photoelectric condition. Optoelectronics, this year's growth is mainly from which products, because there are some like monitors, some of these new products will change. Before that, we seem to talk about what we are in the electronic body, right, after a while, there are some clothes, not sure what these are on the layout of the new products you will see benefits, thank you.

The other is monitor, monitor we define here is not the monitor, that is the display module, it may be an LCM plus a cover, or LCM plus a panel. In addition, some of the applications in the car, that is, it will grow in comparison to the above. If you talk about the application in the car, do we mainly work with the manufacturer, or do we make the app market with some astronomical?

Thank you. We are currently conducting a Q&A. Please ask a guest friend to press Me One on your topic. If you would like to ask a question, please dial star 1 on your keypad. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is Wyvern Hu, Sanlucac. Please help, because we just mentioned the display module, can you tell a little bit about what kind of product this application is? Well, the display module is currently, the middle application is like a game machine, the advertising board, or a set of transportation system.

Because of the integration, the ratio of the current look, this year should have a chance to 15-20%. What was last year? Last year was relatively or lower SP, because this is a continuous development and development. Because I just mentioned that this year's photoelectric ratio has the opportunity to pull to two to three percent of the revenue, which also illustrates battery products, so it looks like photoelectric is really big this year.

And there's another reason? Just like this year, a direct sale of cover glass, and some car applications, compared to last year will still exist. OK, thank you. If you have a question, please press the rice key on the topic key number 1, thank you. We are currently conducting a Q&A, if you have a question, please press the topic key on the topic key on the rice 1, thank you.

The next question is, WylandFu, Synopac, please ask. Well, thank you, first I asked, I would like to ask. The growth of these applications of optoelectronics is likely to start from what season?

OK, so in that way, is there a chance that our photovoltaic industry will be able to achieve a living or even profitable state in the second half of this year? Of course, this is the goal that the photovoltaic sector has always been, but the impact of the entire environment, in fact, is what we have been observing.
