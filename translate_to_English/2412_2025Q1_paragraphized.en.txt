<think> Ok, now I'm going to deal with this verbatim for the user and sort it into paragraphs. First, I have to take a closer look at the specific requirements of the user. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so all the original sentences must be retained and only adjust their order and paragraph structure.

First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the relationship between content and timestamps. It looks like there are duplicate parts of the original text, such as multiple references to "in the first quarter", which may be because the speaker repeatedly emphasizes the performance of certain seasons. In addition, some sentences have problems with coherence, such as "bassadors if we", "crib Growing", etc., which may need to be maintained in the middle, but want to be organized so that the reader can better understand the context. Next, I need to group sentences based on timestamps or content logic. For example, 486. 58 to 565. 94 this part mainly discusses customer service and the growth of each business can be used as a paragraph. Some timestamps are duplicate or uncoordinated parts, from 565. 94 to 725. 64, which may involve different business segments or strategic discussions.

Then, note that there are multiple duplicate sentences, such as "in the first quarter" appearing multiple times, which may be repeated in different timestamps to mention the same quarter's performance. These duplicates may need to be merged or segmented, but cannot be deleted according to the user's requirements, so it is necessary to keep them all.

In addition, note that there may be input errors or speech recognition errors in the original text, such as 'sighs', 'charm', which need to be retained in the collation of the original, but may affect the reader's understanding. However, the user only requests not to be deleted, so keep the original sentences. Finally, make sure that each paragraph has a reasonable sequence of sentences, which may be segmented according to the business segment (such as customer service, video business, ICT business, etc.), and at the same time according to the chronological or logical relationship. For example, introduce the contents of the sixth page, then discuss the growth metrics in detail, followed by the parts of the strategy and future plans.

In the first quarter, we continued to see the growth of each service. Our drawing packaging was provided by electronic services, including the stable electronic market and Wi-Fi continued to gain. Over a year to a year of growth of 33%, and our strong network quality and efficiency focus plan. Our video business continued to grow, and over a year to a year, our subscriptions grew by 12.5%, thanks to our stable electronic market and our special launch of Pops, our efficiency focus plan reached 45%.

In addition, our e-services also grew steadily by 21% to one year. In this quarter, the sixth chart shows the key height of our business. We are looking forward to a 13% increase in the first quarter, the first quarter, a year to a year, and a steady growth in our big projects and the growth in the cycle of revenue, we believe that our strategy is important to increase the revenue of the cycle as it helps stabilize the overall ICD performance.

In the first quarter of each year, we look forward to a year to our social security. We are the leaders of AWS, and we maintain the highest number of AWS evidence, demonstrating our industry-leading technology. In addition, our 5G private website also provides double-digit revenue, revenue generated by international programs, and one to one year of revenue from our AIoT service business, funds and business contacts. In the three years we have developed, we will transfer Bassadors if, behind the scenes of our application to the Chinese people that we think we have had been scrapped for five years, so we just mentioned ing sighs.

Blightnight showcases our international idol performance in the first quarter, and in the first quarter, we were among the high-tech customers in the United States, among the high-tech customers in the United States, among the high-tech customers in the United States, as well as in the South East Asian market, in the world economy, we have seen. In the US high-tech market, in the United States, in the high-tech market, we Mic dónde in the middle of the month issued engineering agent kuen money device Blighton for the product, 1 month high-quality, 1 month elaborately inspired, this is the highest level of 밤� night. - horses are slow, baby economy people may, Shenzhen companies will show a baby's very large growth Oreo. And Thailand has experienced double growth in the first quarter of economic growth, basically by ICT services to Taiwan, to build new factories in the South East Asian market, in order to support foreign business, and launched the new marine aviation system E2A in the month.

In addition, our ICT commerce will continue to grow, and we are pleased to see that the overall income of EBG has grown by 2.3% per year, which is largely a strong growth in ICT commerce. Growth of 11.6% per year, this growth is sustained by EBG's continued growth of 3.8% per year, and the economic performance of EBG's overall income and pre-tax period during the pre-tax period has grown significantly in the first quarter, as the stability of IBC's international economic growth and maintaining strong demand for comprehensive ICT commerce progress in the comprehensive market.
