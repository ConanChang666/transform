The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text copy of the following: We welcome you to participate in the First Quarter Investor Conference of New Road Investment Holdings Limited. Today's meeting will be held by Ms. Zhang Fangxin, CEO of New Road Investment and Ms. Jia Jing, Deputy General Manager of Finance Department. The conference will be divided into two parts: First, carry out the financial highlights of the first quarter of 2025, and report the results of the three business entities operating and future prospects.

We would like to remind you that the meeting will be a full-time recording and will be uploaded to the public information observation station. Please read the disclaimer for further information. We are now invited the Deputy General Manager of Xinlu Investment and Finance Department to present our presentation. Thank you for your understanding. In the first quarter of our operation results, our consolidated operating revenue in the first quarter was 74.03 billion yuan, which increased by 20% compared to the same period last year.

In the first quarter, the total cost of our operating expenses increased as compared to the same period last year, and this was followed by the expansion of our overall portfolio. In the first quarter, revenue growth followed the growth, and then the cost of the first quarter was 7.4%, compared to the 8.1% of the same period last year. In the first quarter, the cost of our operating expenses was 7.4%, the cost of the first quarter was reduced as compared to the same period last year, which was mainly due to the fact that we sold investment real estate in the same quarter last year, with a one-time benefit of about 58 million.

In this environment, in this environmental engineering and water treatment business, we have been sustained by the continuous growth of this new project in the first quarter, which is mainly in the City West incinerator and bridgehead recycled water plants, and continues to invest in this new project. So the overall revenue has increased by 12.4% compared to the same period last year, with a total of 2.9 billion yuan in revenue.

In addition to the real estate development here, we have a loss of 1.76 billion yuan in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, which is mainly the first one mentioned in the previous year we have a one-time investment real estate sale benefit. And that is the part of the profit. Next, I want to point out that the total amount of the total assets in the first quarter compared to the total combined assets in the end of last year is about 3.6 billion yuan.

This is part of our ongoing investment in real estate. The land we have here includes this new construction land, which we have acquired at the end of the 14th period in Taichung, which was transferred to the stock in the first quarter. In addition, we have continued to invest in this reconstruction land. The overall increase in inventory is around 21.400 million yuan. In addition to our intangible assets, we have increased by 12.5 billion yuan in the first quarter of this year, mainly from this environmental engineering and water treatment here, our ongoing investment in the construction of licensed assets.

We are now in the process of transferring the property right now, and we expect to recognize the loss after this related process. The land is approximately 6700 square feet, the total amount of the transaction is $5.54 billion, and the estimated disposal benefit is $3.56 billion. Then we will explain it here with the investor. Then we will report to our CEO Zhang Fangxin for the next part of this business development.

In the last quarter, the number of business stocks remained stable. So I would like to say that we have just mentioned that Mr. Fung has always mentioned that we are listed in this real estate development continent as revenues, and then there is the amount of sales we see here, which is a bit lower than the previous quarter. But at the moment, it is completely in line with our original plan, because the entry into the investment and management of this year's China construction, whether it is in the recommended sales or in the revenues, as Mr. Fung just mentioned, will be more relevant to you in the second half of the year. The next page is our construction business, which is a project that China works mainly contribute to revenue this year, so this page is the same as we have reported in the quarter.

Today we are going to talk about the development of China's construction business, first of all, should be the biggest project in Taiwan, Nangang International Unit 1, which is a project that we mainly contribute to revenue this year. The next real estate development business is this part of China's construction, we will be divided into residential and commercial real estate reports as in the past.

This is the part of 2025, in the second half of 2028, we put in two projects in the New Taipei City Banqiao District project, the first project is Hengmu, Hengmu is already finished, which is the residential project facing the 600,600 square four-dimensional park. The other end of the stairway, the sales rate of the stairway is also very high, that he is close to the MRT Adong Hospital station, the architect, the DCA warehouse, his architect is also a winner of the Pritzker Awards 2023.

The fourth case is the case of Zhubei, Hsinchu, which is next to the Far East Department Store. The fifth case is our first case in Hsinchu. The fifth case is the part of the Fan Section of Nantun District, Taitung City, which is nearly 1,400 square feet of a base, and the first time it crosses to Nan Taichung. I think we will launch these five cases this year, in fact, the three important strategies of China's construction over the past few years, to make a good summary. The first thing is, we will read more cases from the public, because in the urban area to obtain a large amount of financial expenses in the urban area of the city to obtain a large amount of
