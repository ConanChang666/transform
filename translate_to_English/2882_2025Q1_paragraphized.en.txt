<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph transcriptions. First, I have to make sure that the transcription content is complete, without deleting or modifying any sentences. The user specifically emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, so I want to check every part carefully.

First of all, I will read through the entire transcript to understand the general structure and topic. It looks like this is about a company's financial reports or business description, involving safekeeping costs, portfolios, sales channels, insurance business, etc. The timestamps and timeframes may represent different timings or reporting structures. The user's example shows that the original content is split down and with timestamps, I need to reorganize it into a consistent paragraph while retaining the format of the timestamp. Next, I need to determine the logical order of each paragraph.

There may be a natural transition between each topic, and I need to identify these transition points to ensure consistency between paragraphs. Then, I pay attention to the position of the timestamp. The user's example, each sentence has a timestamp, and the finishing timestamp should remain in front of the respective sentence. The order of timestamps needs to be ensured that the order of timestamps is correct and does not disrupt the consistency of the content. For example, the sentence "[614. 12-616. 64] That additional risk avoidance costs" should appear before "[616. 96-620. 36] This new Taiwan dollar is depreciated by 1.2%", because the start timestamp is earlier. Next, I will start reorganize the content.

For example, a few sentences about risk avoidance costs (614. 12 to 629. 68) can be composed of a paragraph; a section about dividend income (648. 92 to 718. 44) another paragraph; information about fixed income investment areas (677. 52 to 718. 44) as another paragraph, etc. It is necessary to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order and that the content is consistent. At the same time, it is necessary to check if there are duplicated or merged content. For example, a section about fixed income investment areas may involve a description of different regions (North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific), which can be merged into the same paragraph to maintain logical flow.

In addition, there may be a jump between timestamps to confirm whether there are omissions or errors, but according to the sample provided by the user, everything seems to be complete. In the longer processing time for discussions (such as the EV and AV parts), it is important to note that these parts may involve multiple sub-themes, such as the investment yield assumptions, adjusted net value, effective contractual value, etc., each sub-theme should be separated into separate paragraphs, but maintain the original order. For example, the assumption of investment yields has multiple sentences (892.24 to 912. 24), which should be merged into a paragraph, followed by the discount rate section (914 to 953.2), followed by the analysis of adjusted net value (956. 24 to 11.24).

At the same time, the corresponding relationship between all timestamps and sentences is ensured. The difficulty that may be encountered is to deal with some longer content blocks, such as about the parts of Guosu EV and AV, involving multiple subparts and detailed data analysis.

In addition, jumps between timestamps may need to be carefully mapped to ensure that there are no missing or duplicated time nodes. In summary, I need to maintain the integrity of the original content, reorganize the sentences strictly in the order of timestamps, and classify the relevant content into the natural paragraphs to ensure logical coherence between paragraphs. The whole process must strictly follow the requirements of the user, without deleting any content, retaining all sentences and timestamps, and maintaining consistency in the format. </think> Here is the complete transcription after finishing (retaining all the original content, timestamps, and statement logic streams): -- [614. 12-616. 64] And we look at avoiding the cost. [616. 96-620. 36] This new Taiwan dollar was deprecated at 1.2% in the first quarter.

[620. 36-623. 04] That adds to the effect of alternative avoidance. [623. 96-639. 68] Our first quarter of this year's annualized avoidance costs are 0.8%. [629. 96-635. 96] That is better than 41 BP compared to the same period last year. [636. 56-639. 36] That forex price as at the end of the quarter. [639. 36-643. 32] The electric reserve is increased to 386 billion. [645. 88-648. 28] This page.

[648. 92-653. 52] Let's look at the dividend income from the past few years. [653. 00-656. 08] That this year's Trump tariff war. [656. 08-658. 20] The market volatility is still large. [658. 20-659. 52] So it is operating. [659. 96-662. 52] This dividend is still a market situation. [662. 52-656. 36] With this Total Return perspective.

[66. 60-666. 92] Take into account Capital Gain. [666. 92-669. 48] To do this motor adjustment. [669. 80-671. 96] Part of the folding machine. [673. 12-677. 08] In addition, in this fixed income investment area. [677. 52-679. 96] We continue to monitor investment opportunities. [679. 96-683. 84] To diversify investment areas to reduce risk.

[684. 68-688. 84] The current North American Asia-Pacific market. [688. 84-693. 76] accounts for 52% of foreign fixed income investments. [694. 00-695. 52] and 18%. [696. 36-700. 24] We are the highest proportion of North American companies. [700. 24-706. 12] We are primarily the U.S. corporate bonds. [706. 12-708. 48] Similar to Google, Apple, and Nvidia.

[708. 48-711. 12] The most competitive corporate bonds. [711. 12-713. 92] Not the most recent concern. [713. 92-716. 80] The one in the United States has a dual-system bond. [716. 80-718. 44] So it is not a Suffering. [718. 44-720. 80] We are principally Copra corporate bonds. [721. 80-72. 96] Next we look at the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter.

[726. 96-731. 36] State sales reached 6799 billion at the end of the quarter. [731. 36-733. 28] decreased compared to the end of last year. [733. 28-736. 08] That major first quarter Trump New Deal. [736. 08-738. 72] domestic and foreign high-end equity corrections. [738. 72-743. 52] The unrealized review of financial assets decreased compared to the same period last year. [743. 52-747. 84] The net value of the first quarter was 8.5% stronger than the capital level.

[748. 80-751. 84] The next page we look at the sales channel. [751. 84-757. 00] The sales channel of the national sales staff is 75% in the first quarter. [757. 00-760. 16] The bank channel is 23%. [760. 16-762. 56] The savings rate. [762. 56-769. 40] The savings rate of the 13 months and 25 months are 97. 7% and 95.5% respectively. [769. 40-773. 52] The cost rate of the first quarter is 18.3%.

[773. 52-777. 08] That was 1.1% higher than the same period last year. [777. 12-782. 12] It was mainly because of the total cost of US dollar traditional commodity and investment commodity. [782. 12-783. 80] Sales grew sharply. [783. 80-786. 12] There was a growing relationship between the molecules. [786. 92-789. 72] Next, we looked at Cathay Insurance. [790. 80-795. 40] The premium income from the first quarter of this year's risk reached 900 billion.

[795. 40-798. 80] It was 12% higher than the same period last year. [798. 80-803. 24] The market share was the second largest in the market. [804. 24-807. 24] It was in the sales channel. [807. 24-810. 60] Business insurance grew 22% year-on-year. [810. 60-812. 60] The performance was good. [81.2. 60-819. 24] More than half of the premium income was sold by the Group in the first quarter.

[819. 24-825. 24] Our share of freeway has also risen to 48.4%. [825. 24-827. 24] In terms of the comprehensive rate. [827. 24-831. 24] The single consolidated rate rose in the first quarter of 2025. [831. 24-834. 24] This was mainly affected by this. [834. 24-838. 24] 0121 January earthquake payment effect. [838. 24-841. 24] The loss rate of visa payments increased year-over-year.

[841. 24-845. 24] But because of the bond arrangement, it is appropriate to marry. [845. 24-849. 24] The overall rate of stay we see is 89. 7%. [849. 24-853. 24] Compared to last year, it was a decrease. [853. 24-855. 24] Improves by 0.6%. [855. 24-857. 24] It maintains a good standard. [857. 24-863. 24] The next time, Able came to show us the EV and AV in 2024.

[874. 24-879. 24] Good news for all investors. [879. 24-882. 24] Next, I will introduce you. [882. 24-887. 24] Domestic life 2024 the entire imbedded value and appraisal value. [887. 24-892. 24] The assumption of the first investment yield remains the same. [892. 24-896. 24] This hypothesis of the base model in the past. [896. 24-901. 24] It is mainly published under the CBO US Congressional Budget.

[901. 24-903. 24] 10-year long-term interest rate. [903. 24-906. 24] This year is about 3.8%. [906. 24-909. 24] So basically we keep up with the past. [909. 24-912. 24] This long-term yield. [912. 24-914. 24] The same is maintained at 3.88%. [914. 24-916. 24] That is why.

[916. 24-920. 24] So we have the return on investment for the entire valid contract in 2024. [920. 24-922.2. 24] In the part of the TWD policy. [922.2 24-927. 24] About 95% of the USD policy went up to 4. 76% in 2014. [927. 24-931. 24] The part of the USD policy is about 4.72%. [931. 24-934. 24] Up to 5. 36% in 2014. [934. 24-941. 24] The overall evalent rate for the entire amount of the TWD and USD are 4. 26%.

[941. 24-945. 24] That is relative to the assumptions of 2023. [945. 24-948. 24] From 0 to 2024 is 4.25%. [948. 24-951. 24] On average, a bp is added. [951. 24-9532. 24] The change is not too big. [953.2 24-956. 24] The patch rate portion remains the same as 9.5%. [956. 24-962. 24] That is why the net value of the entire adjustment is 74 billion.

[962. 24-965. 24] It increased 93 billion compared to the same period last year. [965. 24-971. 24] It is expected to analyze this increase in the total electric analysis. [971. 24-975. 24] The value of the valid contract does not include capital costs of 86.800 billion. [975. 24-979. 24] It was an increase of 33 billion compared to the same period last year. [979. 24-981. 24] The net value just adjusted was 14 percent.

[985. 24-988. 24] The other part of the capital cost is that. [988. 24-991. 24] The cost is a negative 334 billion. [991. 24-996. 24] That was a 1.4 billion part lower than the same period last year. [996. 24-998. 24] This remains to be reported. [998. 24-1001. 24] That is why we have the value of the entire valid contract. [1001. 24-1004. 24]

[1004. 24-1007 24] reached 534 billion. [1007 24-1010. 24] increased by 46 billion compared to the same period last year. [1010. 24-1012. 24] That growth rate was about 9 percent. [1012. 24-1015. 24] That overall created value. [1015. 24-1020. 24] That amounted to $1279 billion. [1020. 24-1025. 24] It increased by 139 billion compared to the same period last year.

[1025. 24-1027. 24] The growth rate is 12 percent. [1027. 24-1033. 24] The value of the conversion into a US stock market is 87.2 yuan. [1033. 24-1036. 24] The new contract for the next year is reported.

That is roughly the same as in the past, the main contribution is the contribution of the new contract. The new contract in 2024 does not include capital costs in general, so if we use the capital cost in 2024, then the assumption of 2023 is about 348 billion, but because we calculate this effective contract, the change analysis is not capital costs, that capital cost is about 5.2 billion, so this part contributes to the value of the new contract.

In addition, the calculation hypothesis changes are reduced by 3.6 billion, and the calculation hypothesis changes are mainly due to several reasons: the first part is the cancellation rate, in the last year there was a slightly larger than our cancellation hypothesis, so we in the last year in 2024 calculation hypothesis, we also increased the cancellation rate, so this part of the effect is about 4 billion.

That is, the impact of commodity structure, the overall margin, the reason is that last year's investment policy relatively small sales volume, so the traditional margin relatively high sales volume, so this part of the commodity structure is about 3.8 billion. So to 2024 new enterprise value, with the 2023 0 dot double the value of about 348 billion, but I just mentioned that we have some changes in the calculation hypothesis, so this hypothesis change, it will be reduced about 1 billion dollars, the main calculation hypothesis change, the main effect of the big effect is the declaration rate, the effect of this declaration interest rate is about 1 billion billion. So the whole 2024, with the latest 2040 dot double the hypothesis, the new enterprise value is 33 billion.

We welcome you to participate in the meeting of Cathay Financial Holding in the first quarter of 2095, both on-site and online. We are still open now, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open first, we open on-site friends, and then open online to ask questions.

How many questions do you have to ask about JPMorgan Chase Securities? Can you tell us about the first quarter of the revenue income and adjusted NIM about how much? Because I want to understand the bank's investment income here, because the comparison is more than the comparison, I don't know whether it is because of the income relationship, or the decrease in the trading power of the bond here.

The second part of this is that we see the rate of growth in the United States is more than 5%, so if we assume that at the end of the year is still a level of 5%, I do not know what it is like to connect to some of the major indicators of our life here, such as net worth or some other, its implication? Thank you. Banks here answer the relevant investment income section, which contains SWAP, some bonds and shares performance. That said, I want to say that this first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of the year, the overall performance of the market is very different, and that we started with SWAP. If there is no error in the first quarter of the year, about 11.2 billion, the first quarter of this year SWAP is probably only low digital, so the difference here is about 1 billion.

The impact of that entire COC, which I just mentioned specifically, that it has decreased by 1.4 billion, and that the main reason is because of C3, which is not C3 under RBC.

The following is a modified paragraph verbatim transcript:. This is the risk associated with the ICS' interest rate at the bottom of its final version, which was officially announced last year by IIS in 2024. It had no upper limit for this long term forward shock, which would be a big shock.

This is why it also removed the twist, so we have to reduce the capital cost of the entire interest rate risk by about 1.8 billion. This is the main source of this contribution. Then, after the second connection, we will not publish, and I conclude that we think it is a better way to evaluate the connection. The insurance company, of course, is now connected to the international, so there is no CSM, so there is no CSM, there are, there are, there are, there are, and there are still, and there are, in fact, the market can be seen.

Finally, you ask me what the market would like to use as a indicator, I think this is to be handed over to the market, the insurance company said not count, just as we have now announced inventive value, it is always said that the market multiple with us, it has a lot of adjustment. So, I judge the number on the future financial channel, I think we believe that the innovative value will be more accountable. In fact, the first part of the ban, that I think is relatively clear compared to the current banned part. Because of this part of CSM, it is a more objective, there is no assumption that it will have the company's rate of return like VNB or Value Enforced. Therefore, I think this part especially in Taiwan, I think it is very easy to be affected by the change of exchange rates, safe costs, etc.

In the future, because we start with CSM, it is actually not related to the reporting rate, it is all about risk-free interest rate plus liquidity tax. So, it is a once-in-a-lifetime market. So, I think this part is more objective. So, I think it will be worth more than Value Enforced, so in the first place, I think taking shareholder interest, coupled with the post-tax CSM, this relatively is more convenient to express. Then, at this stage, the company can produce these values in the future, what it looks like.

However, from the investor's point of view, you still need to consider COC, because we don't have a COC. So, theoretically, we should announce the COC again, which I think is probably not an investment value, nor is it just a net worth plus CSM. It may also include COC. Then, of course, the difference is that the return on investment is to be determined by the market, but there is also one thing that is not really that your company gets this, and you still have the actual rate of return on your company.

However, this is how the maintenance company presented this part, and we feel that there are some adjustments, which are not currently Invested Value, nor is it just a simple Invested Value plus After Tax CSM, but should be adjusted a little more. So, we are thinking now, it should be in the next year should be, how should these numbers be presented to investors for reference in 2027. It is relatively true, because at the moment, I don't see a better way to expose this part in Asia. So, I want to change this part over time, and there should be a slow market Consus.

In fact, the interest rate is not the same as the interest rate at the end of last year. Therefore, we expect to keep up with the changes in the interest rate in the future. In fact, we have to talk about the changes in the interest rate, whether it is in the ICS Ratio or the net value above, because the US dollar policy DV01 is very small. Part of the principle is that if we say 1% of the US dollar, then this is 30% of the US dollar, that is, the relative sensitivity, whether it is in the ICS Ratio, or the net value, it is very small.

Therefore, even if the interest rate goes up again, this part of our impact on the connection above these figures are relatively controllable. Above.

First of all, the company has recently said that there is a new reserve system to apply for, so when is there a chance to try it in May? Then ask yourself, what is the level of reserve now? Then can you give us, if in May or may not try it, the impact of the 1% increase in the value of the water meter and reserve? What is the RPC view?

That's another question about VNP's hypothesis that this year is 30 billion, slightly lower than 2024 billion, and that's why? What is probably the reason? What is the level of CSN in the first quarter? Thank you. Well, let's first start with the avoidance, we look at the 26 pages of the slide, I think I'll just tell you that this information is very transparent, and we'll probably publish it every quarter.

The first half of last year we wanted to reduce the risk, which was about 64 to 65%, especially when the NDF depreciated in the first quarter. At that time, we gradually increased the risk of the NDF, especially when the NDF was depreciated in the first quarter. At that time, the NDF's risk was also relatively low, about 2% to 3%, which is about 3% lower than the CS, and we also extended the period, most of the time it was about a month to three months, and then we probably added the risk, which is about 6 months to a year, or even two years, so we can see that the risk of our traditional risk rises to 69%.

That is why in the present situation, it is actually safe to avoid the effectiveness of alternative avoidance than before, especially in April this part of the increase is a lot more. So I'll tell you how to analyze these losses: we have a total of foreign assets 5. 65 trillion, which deducts the foreign currency policy, because it is the same currency with the liability, we have to deduct, so only 68% of the assets of 5. 65 trillion is a risk of exchange rate, which is the main part of the cover policy. So we are 5. 65 multiplied by 0.68 and then multiplied by 22%, which is about $8400 billion, which is probably the whole of us will be affected by exchange fluctuations.

That's why we only received about $81 billion in April, and that's why we only received about 305 million in the month of April. That's why we only received about 3050 million in the month of April, and that's why we've added about 3050 million in the month of April. That's why we've added a total of 3050 million in the month of April, and that's why we've added a total of 3050 million in the month of April. That's why we've added a total of 3050 million in the year to the end of April.

That's basically what I've just said is that we've been increasing our safe place since the beginning of the year to date, and there is an increase in our alternative safe place, as well as our entire NDF safe period. So until May, of course, so far, there's more, so far, so far, to yesterday, there's a significant increase of 6.1%. The main contribution is, of course, May 2 and May 5, the three percents of the day, about 6 percent are gone, the rest of the day in general, but it presents a relatively continuous appreciation of the state, of course that the magnitude is still within control.

And there's still the balance. So for our May earnings statement, there's no such thing. So far I think it's relative to the situation, and of course the future part I think it's more difficult to determine. What this gesture will be like in the future, but I think we don't want to focus too much on the short term, and I want to talk to investors about the idea that we've been communicating with.

So even if the value of the currency is depreciated or the depreciation of the currency, most of our company performance compared to other companies will be a little bit better, because there will be some damage, so the performance will not be good, but also good. However, especially in Taiwan, the value of the currency will be greatly appreciated, like the 2017 year, it is also a considerable year, but we also because of the alternative risk, other major coins such as the Korean Ring New Dollar, etc., are actually very large appreciation, which is very similar to the current situation. So I want to say that not too short-term fluctuations, of course, to accumulate a little bit of foreign exchange preparation to absorb, but for a long time, I believe that we have passed this tear of 20 years.

In fact, the stock is back on the water. But so far, in fact, our stock is back on the water, about 10 billion billion dollars of this stock has not been realized, and the entire domestic and foreign stocks have been added together, which is about the whole unrealized part. That's part of the land rate, because it does not have much impact on the up and down, the unrealized impact on the ETFs that are priced in our currency, is that the sharp part does not change, it has little impact on the relationship, but it does not affect the greater value of the currency.

That's because the RPC object at the end of last year was about 359%, the net value was about 8.98%, so this is really mine, that no matter the exchange rate is further volatile, that we have a lot of buffer to withstand these fluctuations, this is probably the main part I think is probably so. The reason why we cut down, mainly because last year, we were in the order of this assumption is to restore it to some normal situation, last year 338 billion, but last year there is actually a suspension effect, those especially the times of the health insurance, its suspension effect is very large, so this part of this, we're going back to normal, the part of the contribution of the VMD is about 400 billion, about 45 billion, so basically we're deducting it, and then reacting to our normal level.

The second question is to ask the wealth management business, because the April market is relatively volatile, and it is not known how much we expect to grow or double-digit in the fiscal business in April. The entire fiscal business is expected to grow or double-digit in April, the above two questions. Regarding the credit cost, our first quarter of the credit cost is actually a good 20 BP, so the future, as we all know, this year's market uncertainty is still very high, so we still maintain the last report of the year, 30 BP, now look. The second is the wealth management part of the first quarter, the process is or very good, the April part, April, we are really affected by the market volatility and the whole market is not only in the market.

The forecast of the year is really like what we just mentioned, this year's uncertainty is really high, the last year of financial correction is high single stage, we still maintain such a goal to try. Well, please ask which of the advanced to ask again, come here. Hello, here is a group of lines, then there are four questions I want to ask. The first is about the bank.

<think> Ok, I need to organize the user's sentence records into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read each record carefully, understand its contents, and classify the relevant content in logical order together to form a coherent paragraph. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that no word is deleted and no rewrite or condensation is made.

First of all, the user's questions and answers are alternate. The question section includes questions about virtual asset custody, Taiwan stock market positioning, Taiwan currency-denominated bond ETF allocation, and the distribution ratio. The answer section corresponds to each question, respectively. Therefore, the answer to the same question needs to be put together in the collation to form a paragraph. For example, the user's question section is divided into four questions, and each question has a certain interval on the timestamp, which may correspond to different answer sections. I need to find the answer section after each question and organize it consistently.

It is important to note that answering fragments that may contain multiple timestamps needs to be arranged in chronological order, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original. In addition, some sentences that may involve multiple timestamps need to be checked to see if they are part of the same paragraph. For example, a sentence that can have multiple timestamps in a paragraph about virtual assets custody needs to be checked to see if they are answering the same question and keeping their order connected with the appropriate punctuation. It is also important to note that some sentences may be duplicated or need to be supplemented, such as discussions about Taiwan stocks as emerging markets appear in multiple timestamps, and they need to be integrated into the same paragraphs to avoid repetitive or disconnected information.

[3188. 24-3196. 24] This statement is observed. [3196. 24-3200. 24] It is not known how the city of Cathay has seen this. [3200. 24-3203. 24] The second question is the third question. [3203. 24-3205. 24] It is a relatively biased part.

[3205. 24-3208. 24] is part of ICS2. 0. [3208. 24-3211. 24] There is a talk on the slide. [3211. 24-3213. 24] Taiwan stocks are emerging markets. [3213. 24-3215. 24] What we see now is the investment market in China. [3215. 24-3217. 24] One of the things we see is [3217. 24-3219. 24]

[3219. 24-3221. 24] The investment market in China. [3221. 24-3223. 24] One of the things we see is that [3223. 24-3226. 24] We see that Taiwanese stocks are still of emerging markets. [3226. 24-3229. 24] So this part of the ICS trial is really bad. [3229. 24-3231. 24] This part of the connection. [3231. 24-3233. 24]

[3233. 24-3235. 24] The ratio of fruits sold is relatively high. [3238. 24-3240. 24] This long-term connection is followed. [3240. 24-3242. 24] A layout of this emerging market of Taiwan stocks. [3246. 24-3249. 24] The third part is said.

[3259. 24-3252. 24] It is as mentioned by the newly announced sister. [3252. 24-3255. 24] The Taiwan Dollar has not changed this structure. [3252. 24-3259. 24] The interest rate level is also a relatively high level. [3259. 24-3260. 24] Let's ask. [3260. 24-3264. 24] The current Taiwan Dollar-denominated bond ETF. [3264. 24-3267. 24] What is the current allocation ratio?

[3267. 24-3270. 24] How much space can be seen. [3270. 24-3273. 24] Whether it is the level of interest rate or the level of exchange rate. [3273. 24-3277. 24] is a relatively favorable part of the long term. [3277. 24-3279. 24] How much space is added. [3279. 24-3281. 24] The fourth question is [3279. 24-3286. 24] The current board of Cathay Financial Holdings has said.

[3286. 24-3299. 24] The amount of the distribution is $3.5. [329.1 24-3291. 24] The proportion of the distribution. [3291. 24-3294. 24] In fact, it is more than a profit in 2021. [3294. 24-32964. 24] Thank you very much. [3296. 24-3297. 24] I just want to connect with it later.

[3300. 24-3303. 24] Is there a chance that this pair ratio will rise again. [3303. 24-3306. 24] Or this year's pair ratio will rise. [3306. 24-3308. 24] There is no special consideration. [3308. 24-3308. 24] Or more. [3310. 24-3303. 24] I first answered the section about the custody of this virtual currency. [3314. 24-3306. 24] That first we looked at the entire Asian market.

[3316. 24-3318. 24] Around Singapore. [3318. 24-3321. 24] The speed and amplitude of opening up is a bit larger. [3321. 24-3324. 24] The virtual currency is currently being held tonight. [3324. 24-3326. 24] When we look at the virtual currency, [3326. 24-3329. 24] We will feel that the whole society is young. [3329. 24-333. 24] The participation of these virtual currencies is very high.

[3333. 24-333. 24] That we are now going to be open tonight. [333. 24-333. 24] Starting from the conservatory business circle that will be open tonight. [333. 24-3342. 24] The future part will look at the attitude that will be here tonight. [3342. 24-3334. 24] We decided again. [3344. 24-33341. 24] It's good to answer two questions just asking. [3351. 24-3334. 24] I just forgot about that before.

[3354. 24-3356. 24] Part of CSM. [3356. 24-3361. 24] The draft of our first quarter of the CSM is about 24 billion. [3361. 24-3366. 24] I talk about our minimum is about 700 billion jumps. [3366. 24-3369. 24] So we do about 175 in the first quarter. [3369. 24-3373. 24] This is also significantly more than our budget. [3337. 24-3377. 24] Because it is mainly the first quarter.

[3377. 24-3380. 24] Of course, the first part of the ANH was slightly lower. [3380. 24-3385. 24] Because last year this was already expected to change that decree. [3385. 24-3388. 24] So in fact, the whole first half of the year. [3388. 24-3391. 24] ANH's growth was very large. [3391. 24-3393. 24] That was the case this year. [3393. 24-3396. 24] ANH had no such growth momentum.

[3396. 24-3400. 24] But we include the part of the US dollar policy. [3400. 24-3403. 24] Actually, we have grown especially in the US dollar. [3403. 24-3406. 24] That growth is quite large. [34064. 24-3409. 24] Of course, the investment policy we grew very large. [3409. 24-3413. 24] But the contribution to the profit is relatively mined. [3413. 24-3416. 24] So we have about 24 billion CSM in the first quarter.

[3416. 24-3421. 24] is also a good number. [3421. 24-3424. 24] The relevant Taiwan stock market to emerging markets. [3424. 24-3428. 24] But Taiwan stock belongs to under ICS. [3428. 24-3430. 24] It belongs to emerging markets. [3430. 24-3435. 24] Therefore global is probably 49% of the risk charge for emerging markets. [3435. 24-3440. 24] Very high, but because Taiwan we are.

[3440. 24-3442. 24] Of course we don't think that Taiwan stocks are emerging markets. [3442. 24-3445. 24] We divide it into developing markets. [3445. 24-34451. 24] This long-term Taiwan stocks will eventually be raised to only 35%. [3451. 24-3456. 24] The same is from the current RPC21 points for 15 years. [3456. 24-3458. 24] Slowly raised to 35%. [3458. 24-3460. 24] That's what you asked me for a long-term layout.

[3460. 24-3464. 24] In principle, we are already on the layout of this above. [3464. 24-3468. 24] In principle, we do not make much changes to the present. [3469. 24-3472. 24] We are about the entire stock position. [3472. 24-3475. 24] It will be the same as the current situation. [3475. 24-3478. 24] It will change or be the same as before. [3478. 24-348.1. 24] For a long time, we will have a part of our core holdings.

[3481. 24-3483. 24] This section will continue to increase. [3483. 24-3487. 24] This comparison taxical position. [3487. 24-3490. 24] Of course, we will make some changes as the market conditions change. [3490. 24-3493. 24] The entire stock position of our past is probably [3493. 24-3493. 24] maintained 10% to 15%. [3495. 24-3497. 24] For future consideration.

[3497. 24-3499. 24] Although this risk capital will continue to increase. [3499. 24-3501. 24] But we feel that Taiwan stocks. [3501. 24-3505. 24] It still contains Taiwan stocks with foreign stocks. [3505. 24-3509. 24] It is possible to cover its long-term excess returns. [3509. 24-3513. 24] It is the whole value that we feel long term. [3513. 24-3517. 24] It deducts the charge of these capital.

[3517. 24-3520. 24] It will be in our current total capital. [3520. 24-3523. 24] Because our capital city is relatively high. [3523. 24-3526. 24] So the percentage of our current total configuration is still the same as our past. [3528. 24-3532. 24] This long-term strategy will not change. [3532. 24-3533. 24] It will not change.

[3533. 24-3537. 24] The second issue is about the part of the Taiwan dollar ETF. [3537. 24-3541. 24] At the end of the first quarter, we denominated the ETF in Taiwan dollars. [3541. 24-3545. 24] It is estimated that $520 billion is worth it. [3545. 24-3548. 24] But now it is probably worth it. [3548. 24-3550. 24] It is worth more than 3%. [3550. 24-3553. 24] From April, of course, it is worth 50 billion.

[3553. 24-3556. 24] If that is the case, then it is another 6%. [3556. 24-3558. 24] Of course, there are four thousand billion remaining. [3558. 24-3563. 24] It is probably the area of Rafi now about 4600 to 4700. [3563. 24-3565. 24] This is our area. [3565. 24-3568. 24] This is the proportion of our assets. [3568. 24-3568. 24] We still have space.

[3569. 24-3571. 24] So the ETFs in Taiwan are denominated. [3571. 24-3575. 24] Of course we take into account the whole market factor. [3575. 24-3577. 24] Including yields, etc. [3577. 24-3579. 24] Also contains the composition therein. [3579. 24-3571. 24] Credits, etc. [3581. 24-3583. 24] These are long-term.

[3583. 24-3587. 2

In fact, it is a positive view to improve. Is there no more questions to ask about the advances in the scene? Is there any adjustments to the asset allocation that we have endured after the Trump tariff policy has been released online?

What if we don't want to change the way we do that? Well, since the first quarter of the year we've all been through a long-term relationship with Mr. Trump, in principle, the asset allocation hasn't changed, including the avoidance strategy, including because after all, we're still ALM, so this basically includes fixed income assets, etc. These strategies haven't changed at all. But in a short period of time, we do increase liquidity, and we do feel that the entire liquidity is improving, so we've got a lot of cash levels that we've been up to yesterday, so we don't really like the bank cash level, the bank water level is about $4400 billion, it's a very high, that's probably a relatively short measure of liquidity, and that all the other long-term strategy principles we're on is a long-term asset management, so long-term strategy we don't change.

I think this part may be official, because a lot of things are just at the stage of discussion, so what will it be, I think it will be discussed in the final version of the plan announced by the HKMA. At the moment, because we don't know which plan you're talking about, it's caused a lot of ideas from a lot of peers, then some discussion, but this may not actually be the last stage of the case, so now I'm on this part, I think there's a lot of effort, I want to let everyone be able to cope with these fluctuations, regardless of the exchange rate on the capital market, so there is a lot of volatility, so there is really a lot of proposals, I want to be able to stabilize some measures for this exchange rate, but I want to announce the final version of the money. If we are ready for foreign exchange, we can convert to about 146 billion dollars, so we are going to the end of April 305 number plus 146, that is, if we apply for the new system, we have about 45 billion of foreign exchange preparation can be used, this is the first, overseas investment I think I just mentioned that this long-term strategy in our entire overseas investment did not change too much, but still focus on asset liability management, that is the part of the exchange rate, because most of us are now the part of the new contract, our main source of cash flow is the US dollar policy, we are gradually reduced, because we are actually the new money is completely currency match, that part of the currency policy, in fact, we are in the new contract, especially like these changes in savings, we basically have very little amount, the amount, the main of our main currency is from the ANH or the protection type of these lifetime, there is no savings or type of protection, because we want to reduce currency.

** Paragraph type transcript**. [4988. 80-4995. 48] This will only be the case until the end of the year, and this is the first one. The second is asked: [4988. 96-4998. 36] The second, you ask is... The answer to the part of the stock: [4988. 72-5001. 48] The part of our stock because we are our company.

Because there is no overlay, we do not put most of the stocks in the majority of the stocks in FBGPO. They will be put to FBOCI, so the result is that you receive the cash dividend: [5017. 80-5019. 72] Only the cash dividend will gain the profit statement.

As a result of this, the high dividend portion may be more concerned about: [5034. 24-5038. 16] Because of this Gazette's implementation of the relationship, so everyone will be more coded. However, this is not what is happening now: [5038. 92-5042. 76] I think this part is not only happening now.

[5051. 40-5055. 04] It should be that every company is actively provisioned. This is because these assets will enter the income statement in the future, so we all have a high dividend allocation: [5055. 44-5060. 80] Because this is the future income statement, so the part of this part of the thing is all in the past. You will see that the damaged company actually buys a lot of this stuff that has a relatively high dividend. This is not a new phenomenon, but has already existed in the past: [5072. 24-5076. 76]

That's right. Everyone buys this or is still going to take a look at it in a robbery, but there is a need for it in comparison. When it comes to improving the fulfillment of the Academy. Especially in the future, the main part of the return on investment comes from these fulfillment of the Academy: [5089. 28-5095. 00] And then there may be the remaining part that you just have to classify those assets into fbtpl.

This includes the fund, if not stored, he can only let the part of the fbtpl go in. Capital gains or he has been washed, etc. But the relative part is relatively small: [5108. 00-5115. 28] This capital gains or he has been washed, etc., all will go in but the relative part is relatively small. Of course, most of the investment income is derived from interest income and real estate rental income: [5115. 64-5124. 04] This is a relatively large part.

Finally, this topic has been discussed: [5127. 52-5136. 00] Good, thank you very much to the on-site or online investment friends, if you have further questions, please contact us again.
