<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim text provided by the user in a manner that pays attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence.

For example, content such as company profile, financial information, business performance, etc. should be segmented, while some technical issues may need to be segmented separately in order to maintain the consistency of the content. At the same time, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any sentence" and "not summarize", which means that even if some sentences look duplicated or irrelevant, they cannot be deleted. For example, many times mentioned "adjust your slightly" and "we handle it" may be technical issues, but must be kept in the final paragraph.

For example, some timestamps may break due to technical issues, but they must be retained in accordance with the original, and cannot be adjusted to the position of the timestamp. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph verbatim to check if all the original sentences are properly preserved without omissions or errors. At the same time, make sure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, in logical order, but does not alter the structure and content of the original.

In addition, it is necessary to maintain the oral representation while making the paragraph structure clear, and may require appropriate segmentation and connection without changing the original intention. In summary, the process requires careful follow-up, strict adherence to user requirements while maintaining the integrity and consistency of the content. By step-by-step analysis and organization, ensure that the final paragraph-by-text text is both format-compliant and faithful to the original content.
