The increase in gross profit. And the increase in gross profit is more than the increase in fees. This leads to the increase in our consolidated profit throughout the year. The increase is 18 percentage points year-on-year.

In addition, the combined out-of-bounds revenue decreased by 116 million. This was mainly due to the fact that there were two relatively significant one-off gains in 2023. The first was the acquisition of a shareholding interest in the family welfare of the Group on June 30, 2023.

In 2024, the net profit attributable to our parent company was 206.7 billion. EPS increased by 12.7% year-on-year. EPS was $3.64 year-on-year. EPS increased by $0.41 year-on-year.

YOYO grew 19%. Including Taiwan's unified supermarket. Philippines.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. The top ten investment income subsidiaries contributed a total of 174 million. Finally, with you to explain our dividends. The company maintains a steady distribution of cash dividends. The cumulative distribution of dividends is 85.3 for 42 consecutive years. The cumulative distribution ratio is 102%.

Next, let's talk about the overall operating performance of Unicom in 2024. Unicom recorded a record high in revenue and profit in 2024. The revenue was RMB30 billion. The company entered a new milestone. The year-on-year revenue grew by 6.1%. The gross profit was also hit a record high of 98.7 billion.

EPS is 42. 81 points. The Board of Directors recommends that the 2024 cash dividend is 42. 81 points per share. The shareholders' meeting resolution is pending. Next, see the operating performance of our department for others. The blue part is our food.

In 2024, food revenue was $9.9 billion. It accounted for 33% of revenue. YY1.5% growth. The annual compound growth rate for 2020-2024 was more than 100%.

The beef noodles have been growing steadily. Delivered through high-market energy media. Delivered through high-market energy media. Increase the brand's weekly performance. Revenue in 2024 has also increased. Food sector's net profit before tax is $27 billion.

YoY increased by 250%. Net interest rate is 2.7%. The highest in nearly 4 years. In the case of orange parts, it is the Division of Beverages. The revenue of beverages in 2024 was 192.4 billion yuan. Net profit before the Division of Beverages was 2.3 billion.

Net interest rate of 12.2%. The highest in nearly 3 years. In the green part is 85.7 billion tea drink. 45% drink. Revenue growth of 13% year-on-year.

Including our unifying green tea with low sugar-free dual product line layout. Unifying green tea promotes product upgrade and optimization. Unifying green tea emphasizes product differentiated competitiveness. Unifying green tea emphasizes product differentiated competitiveness. All have double-digit revenue growth.

Strengthen brand positioning. Build long-term sustainable brand power. And see the orange part is milk tea. In 2024, revenue of 64 billion. accounted for 33% of the total beverage revenue. The unified Assam milk tea continues to expand the product drinking scene.

Achieve results in the lower city. Fourth quarter and began to lay off the sugar-free track. In addition, according to the trend of the market, the Westfield milk tea was also launched. The revenue continued to grow steadily. The blue juice was 3.6 billion. It grew about 6% year-on-year.

Both glaciers, including Sydney Sea Salt, have double-digit growth. Then to the next balance sheet. At the end of 2024, total assets RMB 23,3 billion. Cash and monthly cash are 1.2 billion. Borrowing without lease debt is 200 million. It is lower than last year.

The main reason is that short-term working capital is relatively sufficient to repay bank loans. In addition, we can see that our ROE is 13.8%. It is also a record high. Next, we will explain the cash flow statement. The net cash flow generated by operating activities in 2024 is about 4.4 billion.

The net outflow of investment activities is about 2 billion. The capital expenditure is about 7 billion. Mainly, the continued investment in refrigeration. The financing activities outweigh about 2.7 billion. The issuance of cash encourages 18.700 million. It is an increase of 4 billion compared to 2023.

In the end, we saw cash incentives. Unicom has been encouraging distribution rates of more than 100% for 7 consecutive years. We can also see from the blue trend line that encourages distributions and continues to maintain a steady growth trend. Thank you. Next, let us explain Unicom's annual results in 2024.

The consolidated revenue of Unitech in 2024 was NT$448.59 million. Growth of 27.30% over the same period. The increase in revenue came from the positive operation of our company's main products. Iron products were converted from last year's recession to growth.

In 2024, the combined watermark summary consolidated revenue was NT$448,59 million. The growth of the combined watermark summary iron products grew over the same period. The beverage packaging continued to grow steadily. The two products jointly promoted the overall performance. The combined gross profit and operating profit of 2024 were NT$54,74 million and NT$2,23 million respectively.

Gross profit and profit growth are due to higher operating capacity utilization. Net profit attributable to the parent company is NT$1.532 million. Growth of NT$125.02 per cent over the same period. Overall, we can see that our operating revenue in 2024 has also increased significantly over the same period.

The performance of the two main products of the company is different from that of the main products of the company. First, the revenue of iron products increased by 43.38%. Mainly due to the rise in the number one sales of iron products from the same period.

In addition, you need to pack orders from external customers other than the group's stable orders. Overall operation has maintained a stable revenue growth of 12.84%. Next, we report the sales of the products. We see the same as two separate products. The sales of iron products increased by 50.58% over the same period in 2024. The increase in the total sales was mainly driven by the return of the customer's inventory to the water level here and the temperature of the market.

In addition, the sales of beverage packaging have also increased by 13. 12% over the same period. The increase in order synchronisation among the group and external customers has led to the increase in overall sales volume under the trend of stable growth in the beverage market. The following is the report department's pre-tax profit. We can see from the chart below that the pre-tax profit of iron products in 2024 has improved significantly compared to the same period. While the average price is slightly lower than the same period, the price of iron raw materials in that year is still low.

In addition, the pre-tax profit of beverage packaging.

Meanwhile, the growth of the same period, mainly benefiting from the rising demand for beverages, the Group and the external customer orders are driving each other to grow, and the performance of the profit is further promoted. Next, the balance sheet is reported, and the financial borrowing and total debt ratio of the unified industry in 2024 can appear to be lower compared to the same period, and the overall financial structure is stable and healthy. Next, the cash flow table is also reported, the cash flow statement at the end of 2024 is NT$430 million, which increases the overall cash flow. Next

The company's earnings per share in 2024 were NT$0.97, and the gold shareholder's board of directors resolved to distribute NT$0.97 cash dividend per share, which part of this year's shareholders' meeting resolution. The above is the report of the unified industry, thank you. Next, please explain the overall performance of the United Nations 2024. Next, please report the performance of the large-scale unified 2024. Next, this page, the first report consolidated revenue and profitability in 2024, the consolidated revenue in 2024 is 221, the main reason is a slight decrease compared to 2023.

However, although the decrease in revenue, but the domestic economic situation last year is quite good, then the demand can be said to be quite stable, so that the price of the product decreases in the amount of money compared to the raw material cost, the final gross profit is increased, coupled with the profit performance from the transfer investment company is also superior than last year, so our business profit growth has reached 1.63 million million growth of 7.1%. So summed up in 2024 a financial performance, whether it is the business gross profit in the digital to the ratio is better than the previous year, the overall net profit of the merger increased by about 9%, reaching 170 million. So this number can be said to be the highest profit record since the company was founded, where the net profit attributable to the parent company was more than 3 billion, then EPS 8.24 yuan. Next.

Next, look at the combined cash flow statement, because of the stable profitability, so we can maintain a stable cash flow, in 2024 net cash flow from operating activities in 2024, net cash flow from investment activities in 2024, including the net cash flow of 200 million, capital expenditure in recent years because our company does not have some significant investment projects, so the number of changes in the number of words compared to the earlier investment activities in recent years is not large, and the investment activity is mainly used to release cash incentives, net cash flow in 2024 is 160 million, the amount compared with the earlier is slightly increased, mainly because we issued cash in the previous year 6 yuan of 6 yuan to 6 yuan per share in 2024, so the consolidated changes in the end of 2024 of the year increased the amount of 600 million to 2.2 million.

From the green pillars above, we can see that the earnings per share from 2015 to 2019 are maintained between 5 and 6, and from 2020, we have steadily increased to more than 7 per share since 2020. In addition, we have always adhered to the principle of encouraging a steady distribution of cash from the past 10 years, and we have given a five-year cash reward from 2015 to 2019, and from 2020 to 2022, we have achieved a continuous improvement of 6 per share for 3 years.

In addition, the chart below is a temporary dividend distribution rate that shows that our dividend distribution rate has remained above 70% for the past 10 years, with an average of 85% in 10 years. Next page. The last page shows how our consolidated shareholders' equity returns were 24% last year, slightly higher than the previous year.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

For example, in the question section, the user repeatedly repeats the "has not changed the pace of growth for the future food business in Southeast Asia", which may be because the speaker repeats several times, I need to make sure that the corresponding sentences are kept, even if they are repeated. Next, I need to sort the timestamps and the corresponding sentences in order and organize them into natural paragraphs. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic, should be merged into paragraphs, while others may belong to different themes, which need to be handled separately. For example, the question about the development of Southeast Asia and the retail should be separated into separate paragraphs.

For example, beginning with [1857. 66-1859. 34] and ending with [2294. 32-2296. 32], each timestamp corresponds to a sequence of sentences and remains the same as the original. In addition, the user mentions the phrase "sequentially separated verbs" may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence, so it is necessary to ensure that each sentence is independent of each sentence, but to form paragraphs by appropriate punctuation and concatenation. For example, using periods, commas or concatenation words such as "Then", "So" etc. to make the paragraphs smoother, but not altering the original or adding content.

If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the original verbatim again to ensure accuracy. </think> [paragraph verbatim]: The portal. It is just a coin concept. So the more convenient it is to use, the smoother it is to use, the more willing the consumer is to use. And more importantly, like the currency of the entity, it is not restricted to certain occasions or opportunities, but can be used anytime, anywhere.

That's what we're looking forward to. That's what we're talking about, and that's what we keep a certain principle of growth, and that's what we want to keep an 8% to 12%. That's what we see now, and that's what we're talking about, and that's what we're talking about, and that's what we're talking about.

So the challenge is that we want to be able to make products that consumers can't do at home, so he has a reason to buy from us. If consumers can do it at home, and it's better than we do, there's no reason to do it. So this part of the talk is endless, and there's always a challenge, there's no ceiling, anyway, it's a breakthrough. Thank you.

I am the Chief Financial Officer of the State Department of the State of California. I have three questions to ask.

The first question is about Southeast Asia, our food business has been in Southeast Asia for a while, which is just curious to see how the growth rate of Southeast Asia's future food business has changed? Has the growth rate of Southeast Asia's future food business changed? Has the growth rate of Southeast Asia's future food business changed? Does the growth rate of Southeast Asia's future food business has changed?

This is a question about Southeast Asia. The second question is about retail, that is, the environmental costs of domestic retail in recent years have risen quite a lot, and investors are also concerned about whether the profit margin of unified supermarkets is a little pressure. So I want to know from the perspective of the group, what do you think about the development of the whole Taiwan retail industry, and what kind of response to environmental costs.

So we also changed an idea from last year, and we started working very actively to build a local team. This part I always felt that as a consumer product, our so-called expatriate colleagues basically can't get enough ground. So the role of our people is not to run there, but to do management there, and the operating part should have external team. Of course, the outside team is there, the outside team should also be lucky, but this is not a thing, this is not a thing, we must first seek the amount of work from the job. So now we're in Southeast Asia's operation about every week, we's general manager only do one thing, not manage the business but hire salary, each week to regularly report the headquarters, this week the number of people who hired this month.

So this part of my personal or optimism is to assume that we change some methods, should have some considerable breakthroughs. The development of the retail industry, in general, is not a problem, because if we just talk about this problem, is actually a so-called systemic problem. Systemic problem, like what we say about the electric bill increase, the lack of people, this is not a problem, because this is the problem we all face, the problem we face is basically not the problem, the test is our response in this environment. So this part of the talk, I think that our retail industry, basically there is still a space in the process of innovation, it can continue to breakthrough.

So we now expand the scope, and put some small supermarkets together to calculate, so that we don't have to highlight this amount, so the average down and then there are 60 percent. So in this case, our life operation in the Philippines' current development is speaking, it is its policy to cut electricity quickly, so because there is a lot of space, a lot of space, a lot of space, such as Taiwan's many innovative retail models, in the end is the right opportunity, it is just a tunnel to take, that you can so much choice, casually go into a few stores, to set up some of our other stores, or next to their stores to set up some of these retail, which is very not difficult for us to talk about.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. That's what we're going to do to prepare for this, and we can see a very core team of our retail team. That's what we're adding to, and that's what our stock management teams are all about. This is where we're going to start business this year, and that's where we're going to start our future retail business.

This is the purpose of hope for our future retail diversification in the Philippines to begin to make a necessary preparation. In addition, you mentioned a part of the information to talk about, now can also speak, practical, populism in terms of the fact that some AI seems to be a little unable to keep up with the times, but how much AI can play a role on the commercial side, we are constantly exploring. But we have a relatively cheap place to occupy our own group, it has a lot of business. So we unified information about this, it can start from our own internal business to do experiment. Let's take a look at this part, because today assume that we are looking for others to do this, there are a lot of things that are not convenient. But in our group, we have enough of our own business.

So that we can unify the information in a good and powerful condition to get the most out of it. Once we can create a pattern, we can start doing these promotions outside the business operation. Well, that's a simple explanation thank you. Well, let's ask the guests online now. If you want to ask a question, please press m1 star 1 and cancel the question by m2 star 2.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your wonderful sharing. I have two questions here. The first one is to ask if the pattern of the industry is improving because the noodles may be the whole pattern or the two oligarchs or the one that is too strong. We see that other industries may go to a certain stage, and the competition may slow down. For example, like Coca-Cola and Bethsco, I don't know what stage of the competition we think we're going to slow down, which is the first question.

The second question is, what is the problem with our market strategy and promotion from this point of view? We have been relatively stable in the past in terms of the promotion of new products, and in the past it has proven to be very successful, for example, the convenience of the sourdough we used to push. On the other hand, we are also very good at some of the emerging circuits that are rapidly growing, such as sugar-free tea and electrolyte drinks.

I am very grateful for the two questions above. Your question is very interesting, I have been talking about the industry so-called competition, we have always encouraged ourselves not to compete, because we have been in China for 30 years, we want to compete every day, so it is also funny to make ourselves.

So it is a very interesting question to know who is competing in the end. So I want to emphasize that we have been avoiding this so-called competition for two years, that is, our current competition, because the market really doesn't need to compete with people. So we have our own pace, our own pace. So we raise because we are ready, we can raise prices, we don't raise prices because we have other special considerations. So what our peers do, we don't want to follow up.

So what we do, what we do with our peers should be just fine-grained coincidences, and that's not what we care about. So it's a bit of a philosophy, so I don't know if you hear or don't hear. We're really working in this way, so we're back to a word, which means that our operations are relatively stable. My personal brain is dying, and I never believe there's nothing to sit on in the phenomenon, like fireworks, it's going to be boring, but time won't last long. So we still feel that a product can have its success, and it's time there's still a considerable effort to keep working on this business for a long time. As I just said, we're still very small in the market.

So this is what we call a new product, many of our 30 years old products to this market, in fact, it is a new product in most places. Because they never see or need to see again. Because there are many products in its choice for new consumers, we also continue to work hard.

So we have been continuously improving our products over the years. Let consumers have a better, more basic and choice of choice. So basically speaking of the operation of the whole market, we are going our own way. In the past, we might be curious to say that this is going to work? We are all in a market in pull competition, how can we not compete? But in fact, it has proved that over the past two years, we can do this, because we find that the market likes to fight, so if you do not take the initiative to challenge the home, people with conscience to say to find us on the radar of the home, with conscience is not easy.

So this part or we look at ourselves, we do our own things well, this market is big, potential, there are many people, there are many mouths, so we have selected the route, selected the direction, selected the market, or there is a lot of space and opportunities to do what we should do. The above simple reply, thank you.

This is a very interesting question, now there is a very popular word in the market called waste action, waste is a waste action, the direct explanation is oh, this action is waste action, you January 1 began to do things to December 31, you will find a lot of things are white labor, so why is this? On the one hand, there are a lot of outside temptations, stimulation, seduction, persuasion guidance, etc., so you just understand to do these things, so you just mentioned the questions, I can say, not only our company contains a lot of industry, its costs are doing waste action, is the more difficult this concept, very busy, you will find this busier, but you do not know where to go, but you feel like the past, this is a big retirement problem, this is training, this is the way to our operation, we will be able to make things more reasonable. Hello management, I would like to ask the main control of this problem, mainly in the tea drink last year, because last year's tea is very bright, there is a double-digit growth, not only sugar tea, sugar-free tea last year began to have a good contribution, that this year's words we have here, there are some kind of strategy, and then how to grasp the investment, including resource allocation, may have a balance between sugar-free tea and sugar-free tea, to the management to answer our thank you. This year's start, probably two years ago, the so-called so-called sugar-free tea, sugar-free tea in the process of tea, because added sugar will distract your attention, you will be burned, like chicken soup, good chicken soup is not able to see chicken, it is very difficult, so we think of all marketing activities, all the product is the word of your product power, so the same line of sugar-free tea, you can drink, but still drink, but can still drink, but still drink, but these taste, but these taste, but these can be able to develop these taste, this, this can be a lot.

In the end, you have to rely on word of mouth, and there is a consumer experience. It is not like we go to the physical channel, sometimes next to the miss to give you a stimulus, you buy a doll head, you accidentally buy something you don't want. E-commerce won't have this, e-commerce there is also a return mechanism, so you can't survive the long-term, if you can't stop the test, so in this case, only continue to work on the product research and development, and continue to work on it. So you just mentioned that in the past two years, we have some achievements in tea, that is our group on the tea drink, its own basis is good, so in these developments, we can have a very good condition.

Yes, we have the next Haitong Zhang Yifei. Mr. Luo, Mr. Guan Lichang good, I am Haitong Securities pilot Zhang Yifei, is also happy to have such a question opportunity. Then, mainly to ask a few questions about we control the beverage business here, but also very much want to listen to the chairman's wisdom and insights. Then the first question is whether it is that in the past years also met the tea drink this piece, in fact, in the last few years, the sugar-free tea in the mainland is really very fast, like the chairman of the last year also mentioned this thousand ceremony, and then we control here last year was also hard to mention the problem, but it also achieved a good result, including the whole year of sugar-free tea product line is also some expansion.

In the past year, we have been trying to sell sugar-free tea for a large part of the year. This year and next year, we want to see how this pace is going to be, is it hoping to be smoother or a small step fast, or want to say a big popular? Then just the chairman also mentioned that this sugar-free tea is a product that can be said for example, can not ask the chairman to share, is this the first question is whether or not to introduce the chairman, and then I put forward a few questions later. I just answered the question that you are about the tea, now the tea is really, it is a light rain under thunder, so I remember to report you, in fact, in the market, we launched in 2006, but the problem is too lonely.

In this case, we are talking about the basis of Taiwan's tea drink, so it is never too late, now in the effort to pursue. Of course, in the sugar-free tea like I just reported, before the process to cover some of our technical deficiencies, there is no such thing as real gold silver, like not makeup is terrible, that is really good to be born straight, it really needs to be good to practice. This part of the word, we have a very good advantage, but we find a lot of deficiencies, so this part of us will continue to develop.

If we are really healthy, then we are going to process the project, and under normal circumstances, we will maintain it in this very robust progress. Because our branch is going to grow bigger, assuming that we are very strong growth, even five percent, the absolute value of the year can create is also considerable, but more importantly, you create this branch, it is not good quality, this is more important, so this is what we are trying to do. I do not know whether this definition is consistent with your expectations. Well, thank you.

So we have always had this 100% NFC juice, and then we have this bear-based health tea in our group, I don't know how the chairman thinks about the development of this phytochemical machine, and then includes that we will not introduce health tea in the future. Well, the other is that in the past few years, we seem to be worried that this sugar-free tea will break down a growth of this sugar-free beverage, but it does not seem like it has been that way since the last two years, including that we have our own sugar-free tea, and carbonic acid is also recovering quickly, so I also want to listen to the chairman's opinion of the future of this, including the future we have the sugar-free beverage further to maintain a better growth space, thank the chairman.

The following is a re-examination of the passage type transcript: But let's look at the whole amount of sugar. Now everyone is talking about what is healthy, but you won't be surprised that the amount of sugar in the world is constantly increasing, where to go. So that's why we often have a blind spot to talk about the amount of sugar we have. One blind spot is that when we discover something, we'll put other things in place temporarily to kill. So I personally think that there are some substitutes in the middle of it, but at least until now it looks like it's not conflicting, it's still going to grow.

So I also saw a lot of people in the industry who started a little bit of fire and even saw chocolate companies doing sugar-free, I don't know how to make ice cream without sugar. You don't have to eat well, so it's kind of a pain to do it yourself. So I think there's still a so-called abdominal desire. You can't make it too sweet and you can't taste sugar-free today, and you can't because it doesn't get better.

So I think it should be possible to merge into this part. You just mentioned some of the health drinks, you just have a bit of a contradiction. You asked me if the unity will not develop this product, but you just said that there is a unified product, so the problem seems to be no longer there. But in terms of resource allocation, I can only say that we have this product, but at this stage we won't spend too much money, we will make it normal to grow.

So this is a very simple calculation problem, in a year with hundreds of billions of categories, this is no need to go to education, is already in the existing market. If you work hard, you can be a little bit from the market, even a percentage of two percent, then the absolute value may be more than you at this stage to educate consumers this so-called health products, I think more pragmatic. Because these things are supposed to be production products, these things assume that if the time can last for a long time, you will never have the so-called slow things. At the end of the brand, your organizational ability can make up for this disadvantage of your time. So for our company, we still want to say that green tea has made a very good market position, tea we are full of potential, flower tea we also have products, oo tea we also have products, and we start in the layout.

But in terms of resource allocation and company priorities, we still have a rhythm. Good thank you. Well, if there are people who have questions online, then ask the online host to access it. There is no lowest price, only lower price, that capacity? There is no largest, only a lot more. So from a business logic point of view, we see that the more we sell, the more we sell, and the lower the price.

So we thought, in different scenarios, what is the most suitable amount for a consumer to eat, and we wanted to think about this problem. So even if green tea, my colleagues told me that China is popular to drink a litre of water now, I just started to object, because doctors also advised us to drink 1500cc a day, I drink two-thirds of my tea, then I have to drink something else.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request, sorting out a paragraph by a paragraph. First, I want to read the user's example carefully to ensure that they understand their needs. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly according to the original text. Next, I need to check the user's text fragment. Each sentence has a timestamp, but the user may want to remove the timestamp, only the content.

For example, the first few sentences may belong to the same paragraph, discuss the importance of positioning, and the next few sentences may discuss the performance of the goods in different scenes, and then the part of the marketing challenge, and finally summarize the importance of positioning. I need to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are logically coherent and transition to nature. At the same time, it is necessary to keep the order of the original sentences and cannot adjust the order of the sentences. Also pay attention to the use of punctuation symbols, such as adding a period or commas to make the paragraphs easier to read.

In addition, the user mentions "do not delete any sentences", so it is necessary to ensure that all sentences are included without omission. At the same time, no additional content can be added and can only be arranged in the original order. There is a need to check if there are duplicate or redundant sentences, but even if there are duplicates can't be deleted according to the user's request. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read through to confirm that each sentence is correctly located, paragraphs are logical, there are no grammatical errors, and all the requirements of the user are met.

So this is what I want to talk about, in this position, to be clear, is different scenes, different moods, the same product, he may have a different way of expression. This is actually the most challenging way for us to do marketing people, the most challenging way we want to do it. So sometimes, not to say the product itself is a problem, but the product, run wrong place, run wrong time, he has no way to show.
