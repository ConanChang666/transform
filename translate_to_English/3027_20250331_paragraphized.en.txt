Here is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph type: Good morning, all of you. It's really heavy today, and I'm thankful for all of you. Today is our first quarter of this year. Here we're going to divide it into three parts. The first is a brief overview of the group's operations.

We will explain to you the three core business layouts of communication power supply and energy. The second is to just talk about Taiwan's energy business layout and Taiwan's energy market layout will be explained by Elaine. First of all, I would like to make a report on the report before we start, which is part of the operational overview.

This year, January and February is 401 and 41 billion. Although growth is not so big, we are in fact maintaining a growth trend of 10% to 20%. In particular, the sales of renewable energy equipment also increased by 1%, which means the group has been in the past two years.

The layout of the entire renewable energy market is gradually showing its effect. The second in the last two years of the communications business does not perform well in the past two years. This is mainly because the stock left behind at the time of COVID.

In the fourth quarter of last year, we communicated here. We independently developed a cloud monitoring system. There are positive numbers of companies involved in this power company. It is the market of grid modernization and enterprise IoT. There was a small fortune shipment in the fourth quarter of last year. There was an order for a 5G router and cloud management solution.

So we believe that the revenue of communications will gradually grow this year. Because the software part is self-developed, the gross profit margin of the software part will also increase. The third part is in our traditional power business.

But because of the power supply here, we focus on so-called industrial and commercial and security equipment. These highly customized markets. So, in this section. We use our own design. There is also a flexible production solution that we are all a small number of diverse.

In fact, in the last two years, it was also a stage of layout. That was the last year we could see the gross profit margin of the entire power supply. From 26.8 to 34 percent in 24 years. So this competitive advantage I believe will continue this year. The fourth part in the energy business.

We just started our energy business in 2017, and then into storage two years ago. Until last year, the group began to integrate into the EV charging pile and the management of smart energy. That's an integral part of the whole process.

That said, we will also show you some of the hidden secrets of the entire island after our table. And it's a different area. The limitations of these EMS SCADAs in large photoshops. There are also some quick expansions of the EVEMS platform.

So we see these items of the luminaries. In fact, it is a large block of business in this period of time. They are a prosperous period in this period of time. A market position in the energy market in Taiwan.

The last point is just a strategic partnership with strategic partners with US-China confidence. In addition to continuing to strengthen the energy storage layout, we will also do the integration of the site's operations and maintenance resources. There are also hidden development and green electricity sales.

First we see the part of the combined sales and gross profit margin. Last year's combined sales just spoke 20. 2C YY was 10%. 1 to 2E. February 4.1.5 billion. YY was 10%.

The overall gross profit margin fell slightly over the course of 24 years. Just a report said. Because the communications business had some lags. But the gross profit margin has risen in the fourth quarter of last year. That was the part of the overall water-benefit. Last year was negative 0.22.

You just talked about the communication. We also have an asset loss. The asset loss is the secret we hold. Because of the security. In addition to this section. It is a prerequisite in accordance with the principles of technology.

We are currently in the process of making claims. But in Q4, we have eliminated these non-operating factors. We have also turned to hard at ETS0.13 in the fourth quarter of last year. That's in the balance of assets. It can be seen that our contractual liability is linked to the contract cost of the trip.

Therefore, it is said that this part of the hidden is still going well. That in general. The 24-year cash position is about 6,6 billion. From or 2.87 billion. Total assets of 38.81 billion. So the current ratio is 179%.

The debt ratio is 36. So it is said that the financial structure of the whole is solid. This is a letter with you to report a working overview of the entire group.

In the gross profit margin section. As you can see, yellow is 24 years. Green is 23 years old. Just say, yellow is 24 years old. The communication part has just mentioned that the revenue is slightly lower.

And then the gross profit margin went a little further. The power portion was just from 26.8 to 34. Then the energy equipment was from 17. 7 to 18. 7. So the middle of this is why it is so poor. In fact, we sold a solar power plant last year. The electricity bill was relatively high.

Of course, we also have a storage dark factory that supports small-scale DREGs. We all know that now is a negative gross profit. But we own this storage dark factory. In fact, there is a market that has turned to EDREG.

The other factory just said that security is in the process. In fact, both of us are doing an improvement plan for performance improvement. But the impact part is very small. I don't say much when I just read the part of the comprehensive table.

Our organization has been changing for the past two and a half years. In principle, blue is our network. Networking is just about producing this communication product. And then BEC.

The factory is in Taiwan. The part of the energy is from the traditional power supply. Then the Yilan assembly plant is increased. Then it is from Sheng Kaili in 2017. It is a real energy business of one of the main.

It's a charging pile. It's that solar current. It's a solar current with a second-line brand. Then the project companies on the far right. In fact, it's part of our asset management.

At the end of last year, we talked to our investment friends. They will start to enter the overseas market. So we have set up this company in Japan and Australia. And it belongs directly to the bottom line. That is, we are going to 20 years this year to next year. An overseas expansion plan for the next three years.

The main market currently designated is in Japan and Australia. Well, I'm going to talk about the part of Netcom. Just mentioned the part of Netcom. In fact, we see the three development trends of Netcom.

The traditional part of the power supply has just been reported to you, that is, we focus on the industrial and commercial and security equipment of some high-performance solutions, of course, we also strengthen the high-power, in addition to the traditional comparison of small watts 60 watts or less, we actually started to develop from 120 to 330 watts in the past year, that goal is to 400 watts, and then from the original line we started to focus on the insurance part, and then we found a good supplier way to do this development, so our ODM business is very competitive, so our product is the traditional power plant table type, and there is just talk about the powerboard, so we talk about the energy machine, the part of the energy machine is actually really you can see that we are the performance of the project, I jumped the next page, that last year, the largest central Yunlin region of the EDREC dark field, so you can see it before it, so it was built this, so it took about about about 15 months, the whole project, it took about 15 months, and that is the most in the middle of the middle of the most EDRC. 50,000 household electricity for the whole day, that is also shows the strength of the whole transmission gene with a storage package, which is not easy, then next is some grid energy storage is in the construction of the dark field, because the previous said that I am the border three is the dark field of EDREC, this is our own dark field, then the Tainan this all customers, then the battery is actually using SAT or TESLA, then the right just that is the operation of our cloud field, this is the real machine, then the energy storage part of the outer island is the outer island, the outer island of the outside of the island of the island of a lot of rogue energy storage, we can use the grid to carry out a case of this association, Palau, Tuvalu and Marshall, where we have to help their isolated to operate the grid, and then these are already built after the energy cases. 2MW, the part of the EMS SCADA of that light kitchen is expected to be completed 4 times this year, because of the relatively large amount of darkness, there are four other events in the discussion, and the other is the shipment of Taichung Chengrui electromagnetic module, from last year began to pick up, but the electromagnetic module shipped in last year has 11.8MW, the negotiation is also 66. 0MW, then the right part is our Japan and Australia real machine, then the last is the whole development trend, I think in addition to the business part, we continue to maintain the leading position in Taiwan, that the table after the table, we apply a variety of scenes, highly customized with local after-sales service, then we also cooperate with Exco and actively expand the whole case size, the supply chain and manufacturing capacity, the company has become a silver-sand-s Sanda has completed the artist electromagnetic module, and we hope that we can continue to seize the Taiwan's the OEM TV of Taiwan's EMS security business opportunity, and operation, and operation, and operation of Taiwan's.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the script fragments provided to see if there is a timestamp or other format that needs to be processed. In the example given by the user, each sentence has a timestamp, such as [937. 26-938. 26], which may need to be retained, but the user wants a paragraph type, so it may need to remove the timestamp, only the sentence content. However, the user does not explicitly specify whether the timestamp needs to be retained, but according to the output in the example, it seems that the timestamp is omitted, so I will assume that the user wants to remove the timestamp, only the sentence itself. Next, I need to reorganize the sequential paragraphs of the phrases.

It is important to note that the user's transcription contains some non-Chinese content, such as "Modi truck", "igna is the first financier camp", "чубы", "чаы", "informal", etc. These may be speech recognition errors or mixed language, which need to be retained as long as it is not modified. At the same time, some sentences may have a large interval between timestamps, such as [1005. 26-1006. 26 to 1034. 26-1036. 56], but the user requests not to delete any content, so all sentences must be kept, even if there is a non-consistent part of the middle. During the processing process, I need to make sure that each sentence is arranged in sequence and without omission. For example, after timestamps [1005. 26-1006-1006], there are both of our technology strategies, these two, these words may be in the same paragraphs, but the same sentences, but the same paragraphs are based on the contexts, but the contexts, but the contextually, which need to determine whether the context.

In addition, some sentences may result in semantics not being coherent due to speech recognition errors, but they must be kept as it is. Finally, I need to check if the converted paragraphs meet the user's requirements: do not delete anything, keep the original sequence, and merge them into natural smooth paragraphs. At the same time, make sure that there are no additional explanations or summaries, just rearrange the sentences. After the initial draft, I will read through to make sure that all sentences are placed correctly and there are no omissions or errors.

The last part of the overseas market is Japan and Australia, and that part I have reported here first. Thank you for your investment, and I will introduce you the layout of the overseas energy business of the Santa Group, with the international green energy trends and industry outlook. You can see this brief, in fact, we can find that the global energy structure is a drastic change. Since 2020, our main energy resources are all dependent on fuel gas and coal, so you can see that from fuel consumption to 9170 tons of such oil has been dropped to only 5500 tons, in 2050, such a goal.

In the Middle East, it is also said that the main exporter of Saudi Arabia is oil, the exporter of oil, the exporter of oil, and the total GDP of Saudi Arabia is 40%, and you can imagine what it would take to support its country's revenue if there was no oil.

It is also a very interesting place in the Philippines, it is Asia's electricity base is the most unstable, it is a very high country, each electricity can reach 7 to 8 dollars, especially in the household electricity, the people of Taiwan's electricity is about four such base. Then its grid is unstable, so it must be developed a broken microgrid system, so that it can be used spontaneously, to build solar energy storage and diesel generators, to achieve its regional grid stability.

In Australia, BioNed Energy is in fact our factory in Australia, with a project of three to five years, it is expected to build 70MW of photovoltaic 50MW energy in Australia. In Australia, it is very popular, because the current generation of photovoltaic production in Australia, there will be a negative electricity price in the afternoon, that is, we charge it at a negative price, and then in the evening when the sun goes down to the mountains in the evening, we discharge it as an energy package. In Australia, our Diamond Energy is also a license for the receiving industry, which is also an investment solution for our plant.

This kind of cooperation structure, just mentioned Japan and Australia, Japan's word for us to participate in its adjustment market and its capacity market, which is Australia's word for us to do the power arbitrage and its adjustment. It is usually through a project company, and then in the face of the notification party to hold our case, some of the related engineering Ayokan, whether through popularization or sales of electricity companies to return to its local trading platform, such as Australia's word for AMO, Japan's word for OccTO.

The following is a re-examination of the paragraph type transcript:. It must reach 100% of the market for electric vehicles by 2040. [1439. 46-1442. 46]. It must generate more than 60% of the renewable energy. [1442. 46-1446. 46] It is the current generation of renewable energy that accounts for only 12% of our country.

[1446. 46-1449. 46]. In fact, there is also a very large space for growth. [1450. 46-1452. 46]. Under such a blueprint, solar photovoltaic is expected to cover 40 to 80G high. [1452. 46-1445. 46].

[1448. 46-1660. 46]. That offshore wind is 40 to 55G high. [1460. 46-1464. 46]. The companion is the regenerative energy of the ocean. [1464. 46-1646. 46]. We also see that under such a space-time context, Haidian still has a 25% increase in electricity prices last year.

[1468. 46-1473. 46]. And with such an over-the-top user clause, that is one of our current legislatures. [1477. 46-148.2. 46]. If your plant has more than a certain load, it is necessary to install energy storage or solar power market, and the electric power law of the previous week has been officially amended. [1485. 46-1491. 46].

[1491. 46-1494. 46]. Then there is a specific electric industry that can join our power trading market. [1494. 46-1500. 46]. It may also be possible to enter the transition work in the middle of the energy storage dark factory under such a structure, which is actually popular with the Sino-U.S. dollar group. [1500. 46-1508. 46]. But there is also such an interest and willingness to join the power-hungry cooperation plan.

[1510. 46-1514. 46]. The current electricity price difference of the radio station has actually been reduced to 6. 86. [1514. 46-1521. 46]. It is a pity that it was originally expected to increase the electricity price in April, but it is still the case. [1521. 46-1526. 46].

[1526. 46-1528. 46]. But we see that the loss of power is near 5100 yuan, its current plan, or the Ministry of Economic Affairs to continue to make such a budget. [1531. 46-1538. 46] But it is not a long-term estimate that we see that if it does not increase the price, the loss will continue to exist. [1538. 46-1544. 46]. So we still look at a future development of such a rising price.

[1544. 46-1554. 46] That last point was to say that our group mainly made vertical and horizontal integration. [1554. 46-1561. 46] In the manufacturing end, we provided energy storage equipment and OEM assembly equipment sales part, in addition to the storage of our solar energy and charging installation. [1561. 46-1572. 46] The subsequent coupled with the integration of the system maintenance and asset management platform, a service to build a very close connection with our investors.

[1572. 46-1604. 46]. The cloud management system that we provide on the basis of the propositional equipment is integrated with all AI monitoring from storage to photoelectric systems to charging. [1584. 46-1697. 46]. Then here is the story of our photoelectric system products from 40kW to 320kW such a large fish and electricity dark field, we have all passed the BTC certification. [1597. 46-1606. 46]. The part of the charging installation that we have provided to our CPU operators from glue from 7kW to 120kW or 480kW.

[1606. 46-1617. 46]. This section brings us to the factory in Yilan that it is a processing plant near a short period of time is $3800. [1617. 46-1627. 46]. Then there is a complete laser point welding and testing of a production line of the machine and then you can reach the photoelectric inverter with a maximum capacity of 150MW a year. [1627. 46-1636. 46]. The 6000 charging units of the 7kW AC unit that we can actually see the energy storage mentioned above.

[1636. 46-1643. 46]. In fact, it is very customized so that we can help our customers to analyze its load conditions and then provide a design that is optimized for its energy usage. [1643. 46-1656. 46] The energy storage is actually the one-way interchange, such as Tesla's Powerwall, to a very popular storage liquid, to integrate the battery cabinet with the PCS in a container, or a textile or even steel plant to help it discharge the wind during the wind-free time to reach the 7-pound price arbitrage. [1656. 46-1647. 46] This is our latest product, which can be used directly to charge our storage cabinets with solar panels, which is much like some of the mall we just recently picked up a 2MW 7MW.

[1677. 46-1693. 46] It is said that the PCS external, but there is a coal-fired storage cabinet to help it do the Union, if it goes further to the light storage such as our dark field, or 22MW, I am the one-man cabinet to provide such a 5MW so that it can be installed. [1693. 46-1710. 46] All of these products are MIT's products, no matter what the tariff is, I believe MIT's products will be competitive at a time when such a relatively rapid change in tariff. [1710. 46-1725. 46] In Taiwan, we look at Japan and Australia to see Taiwan's business model.

[1725. 46-1752. 46] These energy storage equipment will be owned by the project company, and then put the work down to the prosperity rate to help it do 15 to 20 years of operation, which is the only thing mentioned in Chengrui's production line that we have a fully automated process of assembly of a battery cell is in line with the certification of the international major manufacturers. [1752. 46-1766. 46] The output of each year is 1.2 go to Gaovaouer to finish the summary. [1766. 46-1778. 46]

[1778. 46-1795. 46]. My report is here if you have any questions, please feel free to ask as much as possible. [1795. 46-1802. 46] Thank you very much to the company for your very detailed report. We can raise our hands if you have any problems with investment in advance. [1802. 46-1815. 46] If there are any problems with investment in advance, then our legal statement today will come to an end.

[1815. 46-1828. 46].
