<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the original sentence must be preserved completely.

First, I will check whether the timestamp correctly corresponds to each sentence. For example, [0. 00-20. 30] corresponds to "all gays advanced everyone in the afternoon," followed by [20. 30-23. 00], "that welcome to participate in the Zhaofeng Securities Election". It is necessary to check whether the sentences at each point are coherent, duplicated or incorrect. For example, between [176. 94-176. 98] and [177. 08], there is a duplicate "because of electronic electrification", which may need to be retained, but the user requests are not deleted, so all must be retained. Next, I need to reorganize the sentences separated by timestamps into natural paragraphs.

At the same time, pay attention to the convergence between sentences to ensure that paragraphs are smooth but do not change the original intention. During the processing process, you may encounter some duplicate or redundant content, such as duplicated content, such as [275. 64-276. 70] and [276. 70-278. 28] duplicated "so basically achieved a strategic position in ESG" in terms of ESG."

For example, when introducing a production site, start with [209. 68-211. 12], followed by [211. 12-215. 18], and then [215. 28-220. 08], etc., these need to be arranged in order to form a coherent paragraph. During the processing process, also pay attention to the correctness of the punctuation and formatting, such as whether the format of the timestamp is uniform, whether the sentence ends with the correct punctuation. For example, some sentences may end with a period, and some may not, and need to remain the same.

In summary, the process requires careful handling of each timestamp corresponding sentence, maintaining the integrity of the original intention and content, and organizing fragmented sentences into a consistent paragraph to meet the requirements of the user.

That's what we're talking about today, and that's what we're talking about.

First of all, I would like to thank Megan for the invitation, and then I would like to welcome you all to join us. The first meeting of the first season of Lee Jung. I would like to explain to you about the company briefings first.

First of all, let's look at the founder of our company, the chairman of the board of directors of Wu Dequan Wu. That is now given to his son, Wu Zhiming, who is the chairman and general manager. That is now our capital of 16.4 billion and the capacity of that month is about 6.08 billion grams. We are doing aluminum capacitance, but our whole direction is doing aluminum capacitance solutions.

We believe that the next 2025-2026 is a very positive development for us in the future. That first look at our December, the end of December is 2025. So the entire 2024 revenue reached 100 points, 104 billion. This figure is very rare. That is a lot of growth compared to 2023. Of course, because of the merger of reports, we also have Leeton's revenue.

So this part of the Ludz capacitor is part of our Ludlow, which is about 63%. Ludlow is part of Lidton, which is about 37%. So this is the appearance of the consolidated report.

This is the first half of 2024, so let us explain again to you whether it is the second half of 2024 or the full year of 2020. This is the first half of 2024. This is the statistics. Part of the automotive electronics accounted for 31% of revenue, industrial equipment and green energy accounted for 18%, that consumer electronics appliances, because of the addition of electronics, because of the electronic energy, because electronic energy, because electronic energy, because electronic energy, because it is relatively low, we have to press down, now it is 11%.

So the agency and the EMS factory accounted for 28%, so this comparison is not a way to classify where it is applied. So our headquarters is in Taiwan, where the production site has Lilong Huizhou and Lilong Suzhou two factories. Lilong Electronic Technology Suzhou is our new factory in Suzhou, and our old factory is closed, which is in the new factory.

In addition, in response to some of the reasons for American trade war, there are customer requirements, so in Thailand, we built this place. Currently, it is in the spring wu yi building, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025. After the completion of the building will be a small amount of production, starting from the factory is not much, but in the future the amount of this plant will gradually increase, slowly increase.

Since many of China's aluminum foil plants are in Mongolia and Xinjiang, they are coal-powered, which means that coal-powered power is basically facing some obstacles to carbon emissions. We are in Aba, which is a very good niche in terms of hydropower generation. It is also our staff's human hydropower generation, and the total number of people is currently 2268. Of course, the proportion of QA and R&D are mainly in the middle of the lift.

In addition, we also cooperate with the park, especially material development is very important, so we and the material manufacturers in this area are also in development. Of course, the relationship with the customer also needs to be very close, we do not exceed 10% of our revenue, so the customer line can be said to be very wide. This is because the customer line is so wide, so we will not be affected by the fluctuation of the atmosphere in the cycle.

We are also planning a strategy to implement sustainable development. Corporate governance is also doing very well here. And that's what we just talked about about about some of the work we do in sustainable development, including the ESG part, and all three of us are in the planning process. And that's why automotive electronics are particularly emphasized here, and automotive electronics is a major focus of our development in recent years.

In other words, it was only a reverse radar, so now the reverse radar, the tire pressure display, and then the LCD instrument board, etc., all of them need automotive electronics, and the future self-driving parts also need automotive electronics. It is not only high-end cars, the more low-end cars are used in the future. So this is the strength of convergence, and we also have a lot of customers support. We have our own special line, which is to produce automotive electronics.

Another important aspect of automotive electronics is vibration resistance.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Because of the vibration resistance of the car during the moving process, it is very important that we have customer service in this place to help. Then let's take a look at this, this is our award.

We are also actively working with suppliers of new materials, especially in mainland China. The complete testing of the characteristics of the material is also designed and the selection of the right material is not the best material, but the right material is put on the right product. This is the quality of the design. So the verification of the entire rigorous trust, this is basically done. This is the product line of our products.

This type is actually a lot, because the passive components carry the kind of capacitor, in fact, quite a wide. We are a way to provide customers with a one-time purchase set, so we are not focused on which specific product, so we are a one-time purchase set. So from the guide sticker to the lock screw, until deliberately mixed and solid state, we basically all have. That's just growth energy, of course, intentionally mixed and solid state is a goal we pursue.

It was previously not for the customer, and now it is also for the ability to select the customers we want. So our product portfolio can be said to be more and more optimized. Also, this is our capacity planning. At present, our factory has Suzhou and Huizhou plant, but due to the fact that the factory in Thailand has not come back, it is now all about 6. 081. Of course, radio and SMD their capacity planning is 6. 081.

SMD is 3 billion and Radio is 2 billion. There is another Scoop. We have always emphasized that Hybrid and Polymer are more and more, and one is 0.2 billion is 0.2 billion. This is probably the case.

In addition, automotive electronics is our focus, so we have always emphasized that automotive electronics is a strength in the development of 2025 2026. Therefore, in the future, everyone should be able to see that the proportion of the entire revenue of automotive electronics in Leerong will generally be more and more high. This gross profit will also be higher.

There are also electric vehicles. The part of the electric vehicle is the Unboard Charger, and the scope of our application is quite wide. There are also electric charging piles, and the part of the charging pile also needs aluminum capacitors.

In addition, the part of Lee Rong's power supply is basically a fan, wind power and solar power, wind power and solar power also need PV inverter. Then, this Charger, which needs aluminum capacitors, so there is also teaching.

In addition, the part of industrial design includes the capacitance used in the robot arm, the robot arm, and then it is a special specification. Because it has a speed problem, so industrial design is also our focus.

In addition, the part of the telecommunications network is also, including the construction of the 5G machine platform, and the part of the machine room, so we all have the same. In addition, the consumption of electronic and household appliances, because the gross profit is relatively low, so basically we are to let customers buy one at a time, so it is not our focus. But we still want to produce, or we have to produce.

In addition, some of the information operation is more concerned about the server part, the server part is already in history. Therefore, as the server and the demand for AI servers increase, the order of our customers is basically more and more. In addition, the medical security part, especially during this period of the epidemic, we are very efficient into the medical equipment, and the medical equipment also used many capacitors.

The product line includes SMD, Ecap, and Hybrid. The application field is the graphics card in AI, high-speed computing. There is also the part of the test, which is also part of our AI, we also have to cross. After all, the hardware of the AI is still in need of capacitors, so we are actively introducing it.

At the end of the day, this is our advantage, and the first company we are a 48-year-old electrolytic capacitor company. And the financial capacity of listed companies can be said to be very stable. The part of the production capacity is currently 60,08 billion. Mainly in mainland China, including Vchip Ecap, then polymer solid state capacitor or polymer solid liquid mixed. The main production base is in mainland China. Although it is in mainland China, but just talked about the relationship between the US-China trade war, so we set up production in the spring lily in Thailand, which is likely to have a small amount of production by the end of the year.

In addition, the economic scale has also reached, aluminum capacitors will all do, but it is very important to know how to control the quality when the capacity is large. In addition, in terms of technology, we especially our polymer solid liquid mixed Vchip, and this Vchip and flame retardant capacitor. The most important thing about aluminum capacitors is that there is a problem of drowning or burning, we have a patent for flame retardant capacitors, and the quality is also in line with the market's main specifications.

Finally, the delivery of our service is very flexible, we are not like the Japanese manufacturers, Japanese manufacturers after the order, we are about seven months after the delivery, then we can deliver the order immediately after about a month. If it is a general product, then we have the stock can also be instant delivery, so we got the customer's recognition on the service. So we have the ability to provide global supply.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Thank you.

We will be visiting today. Thank you very much for your continued investment. It is a great time to celebrate the smooth investment and the company's success. Thank you.
