We see 2020, we see 2020, we see.

What we see in 2020 is what we see in 2020.

And it is a multi-national expansion of USSR, our product deployment in Wuhan did allergen, this Let's Get Out! venue, there are a lot of merchants to choose from, give us energy, we have filled up now We ihrem, also said we are small, now we are behind Horny, lead finally, here we want to show Standen, and 25% of our customers' re-operation. Now our aircraft and production material structure, and Singapore's production material structure, we will definitely continue CAPEX, our CAPEX rules are 35%-40% of the IAR level, our first phase is on these resources for short-term appreciation, the second stage is we will have the future five-year investment plan. Next, I just wanted to mention about our San Diego purchase, or the strategic investment of TAMX, now renamed BORABIO, and we definitely see that in the last five years, there has been an increase in demand for the bodyguard for MonoClona, especially for the bodyguards and Multi-specific, MonoClona, Bi-specific, or Tri-specific bodyguards, so our San Diego purchase, not only in Taiwan, development projects, there are also several large cell, mall development projects in the United States, I said, there are many, CDMO, large cell, single-use research projects, development projects, we have one in addition to this project, so we also in the United States, we also increase our share in the current, bodyguard trends. Next, I said, we have our interests in this place, we want to be the most important partners, we want to become, we have to become, the customer subjects, we have just announced, we have received the best products, the best products in the best products in the best products, we will get the best products in the best products in the best products in the best products in the best products in the best products in the best products, and we will get the best products in the best products in the best products in the USMO Smith.

Next, continue on the name of Upshur Smith, as you know, we are still refocusing on the work of the special virus industry and special brands, so in these two projects, the two things to focus on are in our business, in high line, separately set up, as well as brand IP protection, special virus industry and special brand work, well. Hello, CBD Ants also have a lot of attention on GENERICs, Shining, as well as hair, legend, for Genex, and maker, what label is Vigafide, Vigafide is an improved drug, I think many people have heard, concluded that it is the only brand in the market, with liquid formed, and the original brand is the liquid formed, what it means.

It's the only one in the market, so, we did this study here. Vigafide compared to powder. It's.

It's more clear, easier to use, safer, patient-friendly, and more secure.

The guardian is the parent, the patient is, one to two years of age, so you can see.

Right. Test. Security. and Vigafide accuracy. Yes.

Very very very very very high compared to the original Vigabitrin, so we saw, some of the main market.

In fact, it is a different product, in the market, in the market, in the baby pneumonia, and.

pneumonia pneumonia in the center, so we will continue, in this.

The pneumonia market. Re-adjust. You can see. We have a mix. Vigadrone is the original powder. We are in this market.

We have one. I would say. Market mainstream brand awareness. Brand awareness. Written name.

Ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours, ours,

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I agree.

We are now in Vigafide, the pneumonia, the center of the pneumonia, we are absolutely.

We believe we can do it, most of it.

We also see that this is an investment, a platform, a pneumonia.

In the area, yes, it is possible. $20 million. Market size. We have three.

In this area.. made up.. three.. made up.. pneumonia.

In. 2026. And. 2027. Next. In Promise.

In the area. We are also there. Continue to commit. In the high-value area. If.

Right. We have. 64.1% of the stock market. And our stock market. Is 49.1%. You can see.

Our stock market. And our stock market. Relatively high. Our stock market. Focus on. High value.

High-value products, and we, the train flow, we are looking forward to it.

The future of the train process, defrasco, in this year, development, we.

This year. Also, 2026. And, 2027.

We are looking forward to seeing you again in 2024, but we are looking forward to more.

We. In 2025. Able. Advanced. And Smarter.

Product. Going. Going. Going. Going. Going. Going. Going. Going. Going.

Here are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts:. It will be in CDMO or commercial, [1875. 62-1877. 62] and the overall highest and lowest lines. [1877. 62-1879. 62] I think you will definitely see the growth of businesses from both sides. [1881. 62-1883. 62] In terms of CDMO, we will see the purchases we made last year. [1885. 62-1887. 62] Especially on CDMO, we are very excited. [1889. 62-1891. 62] We are very excited about all the development projects we have invested in for three to seven years.

[1893. 62-1895. 62] A lot is commercialization. [1895. 62-1895. 62] As you know, development is the biggest project for large commercialization. [1897. 62-1899. 62] We have many development projects and we have many development projects. [1901. 62-1903. 62] Our commodities will be approved from development two to three in three years. [1903. 62-1905. 62] We see a commercialization of our commodity development projects in the last year. [1905. 62-1907. 62] Therefore, in terms of CDMO, we are grateful to our commercialization for many years.

[1907. 62-1909. 62] We also see the USL resources we have acquired as well as the abundance of those resources. [1909. 62-1911. 62] As well as the revenue we continue to grow and annual, we also have growth in the resources we buy non-oxidative materials. [1911. 62-1913. 62] In terms of business, we are absolutely excited about the growth of VIGFIDE. [1913. 62-1915. 62] Very few drug companies have the ability to have a single most advanced drug-only use. [1915. 62-1917. 62] On the level of drugs, even pneumonia also has the ability to grow on TSC. [1917. 62-1919. 62] I have not mentioned previously, but we are signing instructions from TSC.

[1919. 62-1921. 62] It is a very large market, and we will be the only liquid in that market. [1921. 62-1923. 62] It is very exciting, but there is also a platform for sales and market. [1923. 62-1925. 62] USL provides support, and we also have a lot of support in the pharmaceutical industry. [1925. 62-1927. 62] In the medical industry, not only pneumonia, but in the medical center, we also have a lot of support. [1927. 62-1929. 62] We also have a lot of support, and we are also in the calculation of our production products and the calculation of large-scale production products. [1929. 62-1931. 62] We also produce a number of new products and produce new products.

[1931. 62-1933. 62] and made farmers, and this pencil turned to 160. [1933. 62-1935. 62] pension is more than enough, one send, I. 62-1937. 62] We Enterprise is a small partner and is correct almond. [1937. 62-1939. 62] will the size can not be compared with the acquisition of the whole plant company in order to yeah, I think it's yeah, it's'overall capacity. [1939. 62-1941. 62] I mean, it's an injectable facility is a different facility. [1941. 62-1943. 62] So it affects its capacity basically.

[1943. 62-1945. 62] So when we bought it, it was 60 to 70% full. [1945. 62-1947. 62] We knew that we were adding FlexPro lines. [1947. 62-1949. 62] This allowed another 30% of us to see a lot of potential. [1949. 62-1951. 62] Filling the site will only increase our gross profit. [1951. 62-1953. 62] Also increases our productivity utilization. [1953. 62-1955. 62] and reduces our operating costs.

[1955. 62-1957. 62] In that station. [1957. 62-1959. 62] There is a problem. [1959. 62-1961. 62] From your investment. [1961. 62-196. 62] Can you describe your 2025 KPEX plan? [1963. 62-1965. 62] On a larger scale our KPEX plan. [1965. 62-1967. 62] We will definitely reinvest and focus on three main areas.

[1967. 62-969. 62] This does not include macromolecules. [969. 62-1971. 62] We can discuss on the phone at the Boro bio Tambex shareholder meeting. [1971. 62-1973. 62] But in one way, we will definitely invest in a high-speed. [1973. 62-1975. 62] Larger packaging line. [1975. 62-1977. 62] At Mississauga facility. [1977. 62-1979. 62] We are upgrading and adding new technologies.

[1979. 62-1981. 62] For our customers. [1981. 62-1983. 62] We can't disclose. [1983. 62-1985. 62] But in Maple Grove facilities. [1985. 62-1987. 62] We are investing in more production lines. [1987. 62-1989. 62] For injectable facilities. [1989. 62-1991. 62] We see a lot of high demand.

[1991. 62-1993. 62] It will be equivalent to about $300,000 KPEX. [1993. 62-1995. 62] In terms of maintenance, each site has its own maintenance plan. [1995. 62-1997. 62] It is the same as the industry standard. [1997. 62-1999. 62] I will not be detailed here. [1999. 62-2001. 62] We have not seen any exceptions.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, converting them from a verbatim format to a paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original text must be maintained.

I need to make sure that no sentences are missing from the conversion process and that the original sequence of time is maintained. Next, I need to do a sentence analysis to see which sentences can be merged into a coherent paragraph. For example, a few sentences at the beginning are about facility maintenance and should be merged into a paragraph. The discussion about FDA requirements and new production lines can then be made into another paragraph.

For the release of the new drug, the user mentions multiple products that should be handled in paragraphs, each of which is separate from a sentence, but maintains overall consistency. It is important to note that the user mentions "do not delete any sentence", so it is necessary to ensure that all content is retained, including duplicated or seemingly redundant parts. For example, the recurrence of "this year" must be retained in the converted paragraph and cannot be merged or omitted.

For example, the interval in the timestamp may indicate a pause or change in the speaker, but the user does not specify how to deal with these situations, so it may be necessary to maintain the same as, only the continuous sentences into paragraphs, while the content of different speakers may need to be segmented. However, depending on the material provided, it appears to be the same speaker, so it can be combined into a continuous paragraph. During the process, I also need to check if there are any formatting errors or omissions. For example, the final thanks section needs to be segmented correctly to ensure that all end words are included. At the same time, note whether the connections between the spaces or formatting issues in the timestamp are correct, such as [2237. 14-2238. 04] and [2238.-04-2238. 98].
