<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the content corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that no word can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I check each timestamped the corresponding sentences and then group them according to the logic and context. For example, the part of 2023 and 2024 may need to be merged into paragraphs, while the financial data part needs to be presented consistently. It is important to note that some sentences may be continuous over time, but the content belongs to the same topic and should be put together. Next, I deal with the financial data part, such as gross profit margins, EPS, dividends, etc., which usually need to be arranged in chronological order and may involve data over different years.

In addition, the user mentioned ESG-related content, such as ISO certification, sustainability alliance, etc., also needs to be segmented to ensure that the description of each certification and activity is clear. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of timestamps, such as 2023 and 2024 different items should be segmented. During the processing process, some sentences that are duplicated or need to be adjusted in order, such as about 2023 and 2024, need to confirm that the order of timestamps is correct.

After completing these steps, we should be able to generate paragraph-based transcripts that meet user requirements, both maintaining the integrity of the original text and improving readability. </think> [ paragraph-based transcription]: The part of the certification that maintains pre-pressive hygiene. That in 2023, we officially joined the Bicycle Sustainability Alliance. That is, before the bike industry, we launched an A-Team organization from Giant in order to transform the entire bike industry, probably in the 2020s.

Mr. Cheng is also a member of the Board of Directors. That was the part of last year, in 2023, when we formally established our ESG Committee. In 2024, he also appointed our Associate Li Tianyao and Associate Li Yenlin as our CEO. He also invited him to come to the Board today to interact with you with your investment mood to communicate with you, all of our existing ESG aspects, and a relevant aspect of sustainability.

This year, we will continue to do the part of the certification of this department will be more updated to the latest version of ISO27000. In fact, we have already managed the part of the requirements of the group, and there is also the part of the capital of the listed companies, at this stage we have not been forced to do this experiment is not required to be certified, so I also in order to make the majority of investors feel safe about the part of the certification, these relevant certifications we will get first, first to get first. In that part of that part, in 2024, we officially got the part of our ISO14064 organizational carbon check report, which also released the first version, the first version of the 2023 of our sustainability report, which is the part of the so that we can now have links to all investors to know what is being doing the ESG part of the program.

In the first quarter of last year, we were in the relative industry last year, the situation did not respond to the situation, we have a growth state, last year the first quarter EPS was 0. 57, then the operating gross profit rate was 43. 0, you see that this year's first quarter of this year is relatively large, that is the entire growth under the chairman of the board and the leadership of the board of directors, representing the management team reached a team together to achieve the results. In the second quarter of 2024, just this year, our spokesperson also with you, we reported that the last year's EPS 13. 01, we expect the dividend of the year is more than the two years, the growth of the third quarter of this year is roughly 70%, the first quarter of our revenue is nearly 26%.

In the last year of 2023, although we had a very good relationship with our overall environment in 2023, then our EPS was 1.88, then we adjusted our retention benefit to give back to our shareholders, and we had a share of 2 dollars in the last year. In the last part of this year, we just announced that we had 85% of our shareholders giving back to us, the dividend is 2.5 pieces. So the investment policy is the best thing to say, you have to come to our cash index rate, is very very good investment target, and the overall condition of our operations is very solid, just the first quarter of the report, the situation is very solid, good.

Last year we made a donation and a small story, but when we actually donated blood at the blood center, we did not pay for the donation of blood, we did not have enough amount.

This is the time when we have to push this thing, and then add it to the industrial zone. Then the industrial zone goes here to promote the net people, so when we donated blood, more than what he wanted.

More than 40% came out. 40% came out. So like a blood donation center. The blood donation center is very happy. Come with us for this event. At first they were really worried.
