We would like to thank you for your interest in joining us today. We would like to thank you for your interest in joining us today. We would like to thank you for your interest in joining us today. We would like to thank you for your interest in joining us today.

I'd like to share my screen first, please let me play the presentation. Can you see it? Can you see it? Yes. Well, I'd like to start. Well, of course, thanks for everyone's participation, and there are probably a few sections of the law meeting today, and it's probably the five chapters that I'd like to share with you for a report and explanation.

We were founded in 1996, so now it is about 29 years, 29 years is the period of one week, that is one week, that is one week, that is the period of one week, that is the period of one week, that is the period of one week, that is the period of one week.

In the past two or three years, we also actively compared the external investment part, the investment some of the touch, our industry is still very relevant, that includes the part of the Rudder water, and this big data part, and then we also in the past two years, we with Baojin to invest in this energy storage part, that established the treasure cook company, we are probably also accounting for 25% of the equity.

In the first quarter of 2023, we also obtained a share of Taiwan's financial assets. At present, we are the largest shareholder of Taiwan's financial assets, and the shareholding ratio is about 22%. Here, we also added the Taiwan financial assets, which is actually the first two days, March 25, he actually listed on the cabinet, then this amount is probably less than 300 million, which is mainly the consumables of some semiconductor equipment, including some possible ceramic nitride aluminum, quartz and silicon-related parts of some equipment consumables, of course, after the listing of the current price is about $60, then we hold a lot of 6000, but at that time the holding cost is very low, so there are also some potential benefits, but for Taiwan financial assets, we are called a strategic investment holding, there is not to sell one stock in the short time.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user request, sorting out the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the user's rules carefully to make sure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed. The user specifically emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them one by one to make sure that nothing is missing. Next, I look at the transcription content provided.

I need to identify the corresponding sentences for each timestamp and sort them in logical order to form a coherent paragraph. First, note that there are obvious logical connections between timestamps, such as comparisons of past and present treatment methods, and the evolution of environmental issues. I need to merge these sentences into the same paragraph. For example, from "starting with some dynamic adjustments" to "end with customer needs", it may belong to the same paragraph to discuss past certifications.

It is important to pay attention to the order of timestamps in order to ensure that sentences in each paragraph are arranged in chronological order or logical order. For example, from global electronic waste data to the development of the Cradle's CLGM materials, and to the activation of the production line, these should be handled segmentally. In addition, the English part of the user needs to retain the original, which may involve video introduction, and this part should be separated. At the same time, pay attention to the small error in the timestamp, such as [904. 74-911.] "2 million tons" may be "200 tons", but the user requests do not modify the content, so keep the original.

Finally, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all the timestamps and contents are correctly classified. For example, the final video introduction section needs to be separated and the original English language remains unchanged. At the same time, pay attention to the "do not delete any sentences" mentioned by the user, so even if some sentences may be duplicated or redundant, it should be retained. After finishing the preliminary finishing, read through again to confirm the consistency and accuracy of each paragraph to ensure that there is no violation of the user's requirements.

In the past, we may have obtained two certifications, and one certificate of removal and one level of treatment is likely to meet the needs of customers. Because of the customer's business, he may be required to comply with the processing of clearance and compliance, and the lawful culture of discharge and lawful buried. But at this time, a requirement of transit now will pay more attention to some of the so-called environmental protection or ESG issues.

Because the customer wants us to do not only responsible or properly handle, he prefers us to process the process he is low energy or low carbon emissions, and some more require that we re-use some of the materials we get after the treatment of the ruins. Here, that is, we are going to introduce the grower. We at CLGM a commitment to environmental protection. This is actually one of its origins, due to the efforts we have made to recycle some of the wastes we have received. In fact, this is the fact that some of the 3C items that we are currently using, everyone may have laptops, etc., are very convenient for everyone.

This is some of the information we are searching for, in fact, in 2021, that the global generation of electronic waste is more than 50 million tons. If we expect more than 82 million tons of electronic waste to be generated in a year by 2023, this is a crisis that is absolutely a hindrance to the human ecology. Therefore, we are doing an electronic waste recycling process, and this is a combination of our original business philosophy and core values.

I think this is not only Taiwan, I think the world has matured some of the recycling and reuse of these metals or precious metals in fact. So this part of the so-called recycling is not a big problem. In fact, the bigger problem is that the red part of the red part is the non-precious metal, including our motherboard is the part of the glass fiber powder, the glass fiber plate, and the glass part.

I want to work with our strategic partner in the south of the plastics now, it can get these waste plastics from electronic waste, and it can be recycled about 90% of them, regardless of whether the so-called new material or secondary material is recycled, and it can be reused again into a state of a material. The remaining 10% may not be recycled, and it may go to the so-called "frequency" part of this SF so-called fuel generation.

In 2023, we worked with one of the universities in North Carolina to produce a real glass material, a technology called inorganic polymer. That technology we also developed the so-called CLGM is Jialong's Green Materials. This is also the part of the production line in this CLGM we officially completed and activated on November 7 last year. It is probably a production line that can produce 500 kg of CLGM in batches.

Electronic waste is gradually encroaching on our living spaces. While recycling 3C products seem like a solution. The PCB glass fiber powder generated during the process can only be included or landfilled posing significant environmental hazards. Now Imagine this seemingly useless waste can be converted into valuable green materials.

** Paragraph type verbatim (hold all the original sentences)**. Using in a new chapter for the circular economy. CLGM. Is a geopolymer sustainable material brand launched by Taiwan's SDTI in 2024. With its patented CL molecular blending technology. SDTI.

has fundamentally transformed the molecular structure of glass fiber powder into a highly efficient geopolymer material. CLGM offers exceptional fire resistance. Thermal insulation. And sound absorption. It also serves as an industrial filtration material.

Effective by the use of the material as a material for the production of chemical and chemical products. It also serves as a material for the production of chemical products. It also serves as an industrial filtration material. As a gas filtration material. It acts as an efficient photo catalyst.

CLGM. Finds wide applications in green building materials. From floor and wall tiles to fire resistant fiber cement boards. All produced through environmental friendly. Low carbon processes. With 3D printing technology.

It can also be customized to a 3D printing machine. To create products that meet environmental standards. The first product in this line is the CLGM business card holder. Which also functions as a coaster and paperweight. Its triangular design represents the collaboration between SDTI. Research partner Taipei Tech.

And all stakeholders. Embodying CLGM's core values of waste regeneration. Green circular sourcing. And functional green building materials. After 20 years of research. SDTI is committed to promoting a green circular economy.

Giving new life to waste materials. We are inviting you to join us in shaping a greener future with CLGM.

Of course. The part of the four-stars includes the new environment. Starting with the new environment. A output of a new material. Then we do a so-called new application will have the so-called new environment because we want to use these. A green building of this green material when used in so-called carbon neutral buildings.

The fact is that there is some protection for our environment. That we also bring the so-called quadrant under this so-called more engaged circular economy structure. This includes starting with one of us. This waste first deals with non-toxic and harmless.

Then he turned it into a resource. He was able to create a value for it. So he brought a four-star and four-star part.

Also in this part of our CLGM. That it is called inorganic polymer. Of course, this is a technique that works with one of our industry-academia collaborations in North Carolina. To Jialong is currently holding this kind of technology. It is a technique that he does not only.

It's not just three scraps, it's three materials. We put it. Wasted waste materials. Let's make a reusable combination. Reusable. In fact, what is the process of its production.

He also doesn't need to burn. He has some quick dryness and carbon emissions. It's part of the character. It's mainly ours. A part of a fiber powder on the motherboard side of the e-waste, plus our steel.

The water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water.

This is the part that North Tech has developed for us. A blend of uniformity is actually a constant temperature. It is also mentioned that he does not need to be burned again, and he is fast enough to be able to do so. His hardness after drying is greater than our traditional cement.

The strength is also a stronger part, so he uses a very suitable material on our building materials. He is also. The whole world. The first is a material made of a 5G polymer made with fiber powder for the mainframe. Then he has some of his. Functionality and application.

He was not only talking about a material that can be used for all fire-resistant high temperatures on building materials. He is also a good insulating material to absorb heat insulation with this reduced energy consumption and some properties of the insulating layer. At the same time, he can also use as a absorbing material for some of his formulations. For example, this requires doing some porous parts.

At the same time, he can also act as a catalyst he is an excellent photocatalyst to reduce industrial pollution. At the same time, he can also adjust PH. One of the buffering capabilities of the PH. So this part actually has a number of applications above the development of this new environmentally friendly material.

Part of the product is more than 50% of a carbon-saving benefit. It is some of the scenarios that some of his applications include that we may now mainly or mainly include some of the building materials. Some of the floor tiles 3D printing may be enterprise logo like some of the outdoor. Some of the table and chairs for 3D printing. Some of the parts of this product.

Then he could also turn into a wall tile, which can be transferred through the water, which can be given to some different lines. Some of the applications behind it. There are composite materials that are probably some of the original ones on it. Building materials, such as marble or tiles, are used in our Xiyou Base to make a composite paste, and can also meet some of the requirements of the so-called green building materials.

Here is a list of some of the financial information you can get back to you.

We use this. The board of directors has just passed some of the annual reports in March to make some comparisons. You can see that some of the revenues of Jiarong Technology last year were about 11.9 billion, I think it was slightly increased slightly compared to 2023, but some of his composition is actually not the same. You can see the past, the right part of this table, the past part of our revenue, in fact, the proportion of precious metals, regardless of the sale of precious metals materials and the experience of precious metals, accounted for more than 95% of our revenue.

This is why it is important to say that because some margins in precious metals actually affect our gross profit, because some margins in our industry in fact may be between 1 to 5%, but this non-precious metal is like some of our electronic waste disposal, which includes some of the recycling or refining services we have provided or other related services, his margin rate can be about 30% to 50%, so in fact, these non-precious metal non-precious revenue promotion is a part of some of the improvement of our profitability. This is the last year should be said for several consecutive years and four quarters of our profit table, but last year I think we see a last number of losses like last year is more than the previous three years, I think there is a gradual reduction in the fourth quarter of the transition process, in fact we have some of the last year of the year of the second quarter of the second quarter of the year, we want to do a bit of the next year, and we want to do a bit more of the next year, and we want to do a bit more of the next year to do a bit more of the same. In the past two years, we have continued to reduce the amount of money we have invested to increase our subsequent capital expenditure or foreign investment. In fact, this part of our non-current assets has increased significantly, which is part of our equity strategy investment. We have just mentioned that some of our transition investments, whether in the big data of water resources, and in the future, we will continue to do some more investment.

In the first quarter of this year, we have made some adjustments to turn some of our short-term borrowings into long-term borrowings at the end of the first quarter of this year. After the end of the first quarter, I think that some of the relevant parts of this area, including the current ratio or the use of long-term funds, will not be called some kind of short-term branch of improvement.

This is a crucial moment for the future development of Jialong, and we want to make sure that the future direction of the company is correct. [1796. 14-1797. 94] We need to understand the future direction of Jialong. [1798. 18-1799. 98] We need to understand the core values and objectives of the company. [1798. 18-1799. 98] It is possible to lose or lose status, but the cash flow part is completely no problem, which is the key to the future development of Jialong. [1800. 24-1804. 84] The account is a continuous loss, but the cash flow part is completely no problem, which is the key to the future development of Jialong.

[1808. 18-1810. 86] Next, let us report on the direction of the future development of Jialong. [1811. 12-1813. 54] What is the future development direction of Jialong? We need to know more about the core values and objectives of the company. [1813. 80-1814. 58] These two aspects are the key to the future development of Jialong. [1814. 82-1819. 94] It is probably the adjustment of some so-called physiques we have made since 2022. [1820. 20-1822. 76] Because we believe that from quality change can bring a portion of the so-called financial statements above.

[1823. 02-1824. 82] A portion of the financial statements above is the key to the future development of Jialong. [1825. 12-1825. 62] Part of the financial statements is the key to the future development of Jialong. [1826. 14-1827. 42] We started a so-called deep learning project from the 4th quarter of 2022 in 2024. [1827. 68-1832. 54] Through this project, we made so-called process combing and inventory degradation to see a continuous drop in the entire inventory just after the project was started, and it also resulted in a decrease in the benefit of the project since the project was started. [1823. 80-1838. 94] Through this project, we made the so-called process combing and inventory degradation to see a continuous drop in the entire inventory, since the project started. [1839. 20-1844. 58]

[1844. 82-1849. 94] At least 300 kilograms of cash flow received by him in advance for us to recover the degradation of the platinum. [1850. 46-1852. 50] The cash flow received by us more than 300 million. [1852. 76-1854. 82] There is also a Maori contribution we have about 30 million. [1855. 12-1855. 62] A Maori profit. [1855. 88-1857. 16] This is the first stage. [1857. 42-1885. 96] The present stage is actually more important than the first stage.

[1859. 22-1859. 72] Because he is a cornerstone of the sustainable development of the future of Jialong. [1859. 98-1863. 30] Because he is a foundation of the sustainable development of the future of Jialong. [1863. 56-1865. 86] includes the advice of the talent development team and the formation of culture. [1866. 12-1867. 40] and the formation of culture. [1867. 66-1871. 50] Here we are building the so-called culture of the company that includes our talents. [1871. 76-1874. 06] The integrity and integrity of innovation must be a characteristic of his work.

[1874. 32-1876. 88] A characteristic of innovation passion and his work. [1877. 38-1882. 76] At the same time, we in the technical part of the team began to develop our new technology. [1883. 02-1884. 56] The new technology we wanted to develop is the part of the material application. [1884. 86-1885. 88] The part of the material application. [1886-1887. 68] includes the CLGM of the non-cast metal just mentioned earlier. [1888. 18-1889. 72] The CLGM of the non-cast metal.

[1889. 98-1893. 82] Part of metal precious metals includes the green crystalline green gold target SLAG with some five-grain five-carbon gold and high clean semiconductor parts cleaning. [1894. 34-1895. 36] Green crystalline green gold target SLAG with some five-grain five-carbon gold and high clean semiconductor parts cleaning. [1895. 62-1896. 12] SLAG with some five-grain five-carbon gold and high clean semiconductor parts cleaning. [1896. 38-1897. 14] And some five-grain five-carbon gold and high clean semiconductor parts cleaning. [1897. 40-1900. 22] This is the part of the technology that we are currently building up and even in manufacturing. [1900. 48-1891. 76] This is the part of the technology that we have built and the product.

[1910. 20-1913. 54] The whole precious metals and non-gave metals are called the whole-cycle economy. [1913. 78-1914. 56] As we have just said, he is from cradle to cradle. [1914. 86-1917. 68] We hope that he is from cradle to cradle. [1917. 94-1920. 24] Any material can be re-used after this end of life.

[1920. 50-1921. 78] Any material can be reused after this end of life. [1922. 02-1923. 30] This end of life is reused after this end of life. [1923. 56-1927. 40] This end of life is reused after this end of life. [1927. 66-1929. 70] So by close loop and value edit the way we work together. [1929. 96-1931. 50] The way we work together. [1931. 76-1934. 32] We develop our all-round economic model.

[1935. 08-1939. 44] We are developing our all-round economic model. [1939. 70-1940. 20] Here we focus on a key cosmetic focus in five industries, including the category III semiconductor aerospace resource regeneration industry and the green materials industry and the Goethe semiconductor industry. [1940. 46-1944. 30] The regeneration of resources industry and the green materials industry and the Goethe semiconductor industry. [1944. 86-1951. 00] At the same time, we define our future development strategy, which he calls a nuclear four-star 40 plus one. [1951. 26-1952. 28] Here we explain briefly what is called a nuclear four-star 44 plus one. [1952. 54-1956. 38]

[1956. 90-1963. 54] The core of this nucleus is that we are developing four new business models under the circular economy, including new green energy cooperation and new business model. [1963. 80-966. 36] New green energy cooperation and new business model. [1966. 62-971. 48] The new green energy cooperation and new business model. [1971. 74-1974. 30] The addition of 44 is that it is one of the four major production lines and a center. [1974. 86-1976. 40] The four production lines are that Galon has built some of the original production lines that we want to upgrade and do some efficiency improvements including parts cleaning. [1976. 66-1977. 94] Some of the original production lines we want to upgrade and do some of the parts cleaning.

[1978. 18-1983. 06] Some of the original production lines wanted to make some upgrades and some efficiency improvements, including parts cleaning. [1983. 30-1984. 08] Along with some efficiency improvements, including parts cleaning. [1984. 34-1986. 90] Efficiency improvements include parts cleaning. [1987. 14-1989. 46] There is also the electronic waste part of urban mining. [1989. 70-1992. 26] The high-end gold part is also a key part of what we are currently developing in the application of materials and wastewater treatment I think are some of the new production lines that were built in the original Gallon. [1992. 52-1994. 82]

[1995. 08-2002. 76] The parts of the material application and wastewater treatment of the Golden will have been built. [2003. 02-2003. 78] The existing production line. [2004. 04-2004. 82] The other four platforms, including our green business and the new environmental protection materials just mentioned in the CL, and the addition of GIDC Internet Data Center, another industry grafting advantage is our four platforms. [2007. 42-2009. 22] The coupled advantages are complementary parts of our four platforms. [2009. 46-2011. 26] The new environmental protection materials and the addition of GIDC Internet Data Center, another industry grafting advantage complementary part of our four platforms. [2011. 52-2012. 80] The coupled advantage is the complementary part of our four platforms.

[2013. 06-2013. 82] The coupled advantage is the complementary part of our four platforms. [2014. 08-2016. 64] The coupled advantage is the complementary part of our four platforms. [2016. 90-2017. 40] injected some new dynamics for some of our future growth. [2017. 66-2018. 94] injected some new dynamics. [2019. 2020-2020. 22] injected some new dynamics. [2020. 48-2024. 82] We also value some of our own R&D centers as part of our talents.

[2025. 08-2026. 62] Because of this, we can bring a technology autonomy and a key talent. [2026. 88-2028. 92] Technology autonomy and a key talent. [2029. 44-2032. 00] So through a core quadrant 44 to add one of our future direction to the focus of a nuclear quadrant. [2032. 26-2032. 76] Our future direction is to the focus of a nuclear quadrant. [2033. 02-2034. 30] The future direction is to the focus of a nuclear quadrant. [2034. 56-2034. 82] Focus on the business of a nuclear quadrant.

[2035. 06-2035. 62] We hope to bring a different transformation to Gallon. [2035. 88-2041. 00] We hope to bring a different transformation to Gallon. [2041. 00-2045. 36] Here we add to the part of our green energy that we have now have five dark fields. [2045. 62-046. 12] Dark fields. [2046. 64-2050. 22] Our Guanyin one of our two Yellowstone plant and one of our warehouses built some of these solar power plants. [2050. 74-2053. 30] Our Yellowstone plant also has one of the above our warehouses.

[2053. 54-2058. 16] The land above has built some equipment for the solar power generation. [2058. 42-2059. 44] This equipment. [2059. 70-2060. 20] Equipment. [2060. 72-2064. 04] That's what we are now saying is that the three dark fields we are given are the parts of this blue house. [2064. 30-2064. 82] That's the part of the blue house that got up. [2065. 12-2066. 14]

[2066. 40-2067. 42] The part of the house up. [2067. 68-2070. 74] The green dark field is where we now adopt the so-called spontaneous use of the BRPB part of the solar power plant in the second phase and the second part of our yellow plant. [2071. 00-2072. 28] The solar power plant part in the second phase and the second part of our yellow plant. [2072. 54-2075. 62] The solar power plant part in the second phase and the second part of our yellow plant. [2076. 86-2076. 38] The second part of our yellow plant. [2076. 64-2078. 18] The second part of the yellow plant.

[2078. 42-2079. 20] The total power generation unit capacity is about 1728 kW. [2079. 46-2082. 52] The unit capacity is about 1728 kW. [2082. 78-2084. 32] This K watt part. [2084. 58-2085. 60] This K watt part. [2085. 58-2087. 38] The whole year of this power generation is true if we turn it into a part of a year-round electricity usage that is larger than our current electricity consumption. [2087. 90-2094. 30] If we turn it into a self-use part of a year-round electricity usage.

[2094. 56-2096. 10] If we can spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously we have reached the RE100. [2096. 34-2099. 16] If we can spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously we have reached the so-called RE100. [2099. 94-110. 98] But here we have a strategy of 5 plus N. [2102.2104. 02] The 5 plus N is the part of the 5 plus we have to continue to add some of our own or develop in the 5 existing dark fields.

[2108. 38-2110. 68] We will also continue to increase some of the holdings or development parts of the dark field. [2110. 94-2113. 50] Some of the holdings or development parts of the dark field. [2114. 78-2116. 58] This is a 5 plus N of this new dark field. [2116. 82-2118. 36] This new dark field part. [2118. 62-2119. 38]

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the provided transcription fragments to see if there is a clear segmentation point. Each timestamp in the transcription corresponds to a sentence, and I need to group these sentences logically and semanticly to form a coherent paragraph. For example, a part of the BRPB concept may need to be merged into a paragraph, while a part of the transformation of the canon may need another paragraph. Next, I need to make sure that the sentence sequence within each paragraph is correct and there is no missing anything. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the converted paragraphual transcription is coherent on the timeline.

In addition, the Q&A section mentioned by the user needs to pay special attention because the questions and answers may be scattered in different timestamps. I need to combine the same questions and answered sentences together to maintain the integrity of the conversation. For example, questions about the precious metals bullish, need to properly correspond to the various parts of the question and answer. During the processing process, I will check every step of the check to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the user mentions the BRPB concept and the "transformation strategy" are two different topics and should be segmented. At the same time, note that technical terms such as BAB, BIPB, etc. are preserved correctly and no modifications are made.

Finally, I will read the whole converted paragraph-by-word transcription to confirm that all sentences are correctly classified, and the transition between paragraphs is natural and fully compliant with the user's requirements. Make sure that no personal opinions or changes are added to the content to keep the original text accurate and complete. </think> Here is the compiled paragraph-by-text transcription: [2211. 70-2212. 72] Probably. [2213. 48-2215. 28] This is what I would say by the next paragraph. [2215. 54-2220. 66] This is the tradition if we were to cover a solar part on a roof above a building.

[2220. 92-2223. 98] It's on the roof and adds it to it. [2224. 24-2225. 52] But the BRPB concept is. [2225. 78-2228. 84] I don't need to cover it anymore I can. [2229. 10-2230. 64] If I build a new plant. [2230. 90-2233. 46] I set up the BRPB directly on the roof. [2233. 72236. 02] I think I can subtract this one from my future.

[2236. 28-2242. 16] The steel plate of the roof above it may be 10 to 12 years to replace some of the associated costs with some. [2242. 16-2243. 96] This part of the operation is troublesome. [2244. 20-2246. 00] And its one service life. [2246. 26-2247. 54] is more than 30 years. [2247. 80-2248. 82] The longest is 40 years. [2249. 08-2250. 36] So this part I think.

[2250. 60-2256. 76] It has a sizable effect on its power generation and I don't want to lose the traditional BAB or BIPB part. [2257. 00-2261. 10] This part is also part of our strategic partner currently being combined. [2266. 36-2264. 18] In the development or even in the promotion part. [2266. 48-2271. 34] I think this is the fourth quarter of the growing process and I'm continuing to make some transformations of course from us. [2271. 60-2272. 12]

[2276. 00-2280. 86] The future may see more clearly the results of Cannon's transformation. [2281. 12-2282. 40] The past may be what we call it. [2282. 66-2285. 72] In this case, whether in some waste. [2285. 98-2287. 00] Clear treatment. [2287. 26-2288. 28] Parts are cleaned. [2288. 54-2289. 56] Some crystalstones or.

[2289. 82-2290. 60] Crystals are raw materials. [2291. 10-2293. 40] Partially or recycled electronic waste. [2293. 66-2294. 68] Fine-grained parts. [2294. 94-2295. 46] We. [2295. 72-2296. 48] Comparative. [2297. 00-2301. 60] is called to provide some customers with a single product and services.

[2301. 86-2302. 88] We would like to take it. [2303. 14-2304. 92] Do an upgrade. [2305. 18-2307. 24] We offer some complete solutions to our customers. [2307. 48-2308. 26] Solutions. [2308. 52-2309. 80] Through the so-called close loop. [2310. 04-2312. 36] And the so-called full circular economy model.

[2312. 60-2314. 40] In industrial customers, I can provide. [2314. 66-2315. 42] Industrial customers. [2315. 68-2318. 50] Whether it is the removal of recycling and reuse. [2318. 76-2322. 08] We get some raw materials for precious metals. [2322. 34-2325. 40] We can do some material such as some of the current developments. [2325. 66-2328. 22] This text or gold target.

[2328. 48-2330. 52] SLAG Goldstone Green Goldstone. [2330. 52-2332. 82] The other part of the electronic waste. [2333. 08-2339. 22] We do some recycling by eliminating the disposal and recycling of some non-metallic raw materials. [2339. 48-2340. 24] Applying materials. [2340. 50-2341. 28] Applying materials. [2341. 52-2345. 12] Including the Western ear area that we just mentioned earlier, we have also developed.

[2345. 36-2346. 40] Filters. [2346. 64-2349. 98] At the same time, we are also about this past. [2350. 24-2352. 80] 20 years in the green side of the one. [2353. 04-2358. 16] This practical experience we also have some related services for some of our environmental professional consultants. [2358. 42-2359. 44] Includes some solid state. [2359. 96-2360. 48] Liquid waste.

[2360. 78-2362. 82] Some low-carbon solutions. [2363. 08-2365. 64] There are solar energy if you want to build a solar dark field. [2365. 90-2367. 18] or other parts of the material. [2367. 44-2369. 48] We also have some related solutions. [2369. 74-2372. 04] In energy storage I want to work with the deposit here. [2372. 30-2375. 88] Get some solutions related to energy storage.

[2376. 14-2376. 90] This. [2377. 16-2377. 68] know how [2377. 92-2379. 46] Another part of the water resources. [2379. 72-2380. 24] So, it is possible to see here that it is said that the grower may. [2380. 48-2382. 80] You know that [2384. 32235. 36] the grower.

[2385. 60-2387. 14] Probably we will consider it as a so-called industry. [2387. 40-2388. 94] A recycling industry. [2389. 20-2390. 48] But now. [2390. 78-2391. 80] We extend backwards. [2392. 06-2394. 10] We go to the so-called material application. [2394. 36-2395. 64] Part One.

[2395. 90-2396. 66] Transformation. [2396. 92-2402. 80] I think the change here is something that everyone can look forward to in the future. [2403. 06-2406. 14] The above report section I would like to put it again. [2406. 64-2407. 16] This. [2407. 42-2410. 48] Organizing bars and returning to a part of our colleagues. [2410. 74-2411. 26] Thank you.

[2412. 54-2414. 58] We are very grateful to the Chief Financial Officer. [2414. 84-2416. 12] Talk about this briefing. [2416. 38-2420. 48] Now it is time for you to invest in advanced Q&A, if you have any investment in advanced. [2420. 78-2421. 80] Questions. [2422. 06-2429. 74] Welcome to use the chat room below to ask questions or to raise your hand to speak for you. [2445. 10-2447. 40] If you have any questions.

[2447. 92-2448. 68] It doesn't matter to you. [2448. 94-2449. 44] Chat room. [2449. 70-2450. 22] Okay. [2450. 78-2452. 82] But raise your hand to solve this problem. [2453. 08-2453. 84] Here. [2454. 10-2456. 16] I will try my best to reply.

[2456. 66-2475. 94] The business is endless. [2496. 28-2484. 62] We are the quick investment here. [2486. 92-2488. 96] The chief financial officer is good. [2489. 22-2490. 00] Hello. [2491. 28-2496. 40] Please tell us that precious metals are not at a price. [2496. 64-2499. 20] I don't know much about this.

[2499. 46-2502. 02] The price increase is for us. [2502. 28-2504. 84] From the perspective of earnings, it does not seem to be the one. [2505. 36-2506. 64] Benefits. [2507 40-2509. 44] What benefits can be derived. [2509. 70-2511. 24] This can be helpful. [2511. 74-2513. 80] Help us explain why.

[2515. 08-2516. 60] I think. [2517. 12-2518. 66] This precious metal. [2518. 92-2523. 00] The price of gold, especially the price of gold, has a certain effect on us. [2523. 26-2524. 80] He has a positive effect on the other. [252525. 06-2526. 08] Negative parts. [2526. 34-2528. 12] Of course, I say negatively what you need.

[2528. 38-2529. 40] Prepare more. [2529. 66-2531. 46] A cash or money. [2531. 72-2534. 02] I can do this. [2534. 28-2537. 60] We use precious metals as a part of the material to buy. [2537. 86-2539. 40] Of course, we say it as part of the sale area. [2539. 70-2542. 76] We actually do a lot of this now.

[2543. 02-2544. 82] The sale of this precious metal. [2545. 32-2547. 88] In fact, we adopt the so-called natural avoidance. [2548. 40-2549. 16] The way. [2549. 42-2554. 04] I said that we are in this part of this precious metal bank that may be with this precious metal bank. [2554. 28-2558. 64] We have a limit of material that we can achieve through this material limit. [2558. 90-2559. 92] We sell precious metals.

[2560. 44-2561. 20] Whether it is the raw material of precious metals or the part of the golden face. [2564. 28-2568. 36] We can buy or sell some of these on the same day. [2568. 62-2569. 40] Possible. [2569. 64-2571. 48] Loss of price fluctuations. [2571. 74-2572. 76] Controlled.

[2573. 02-2579. 42] So it also means that I can control the risk of one of my precious metals so that he is on one of his profits. [2579. 94-2580. 96] This reaction. [2581. 22-2586. 34] This reaction will not be so big but there is another piece of us from it. [2587. 88-2591. 46] The precious metals recovered because of what he received. [2571. 72-2595. 30] The cost is because he turned from the state of waste into precious metals.

[2595. 80-2598. 62] So that part will still be some. [2598]

So, it is clear that we are now in the future, about 1.7,1.7K, this kW, this generation, this year, the capacity of the power generation, the part of the power generation. That just saw the continent about 1.4 or so, in fact, it is quite simple, with this one here in Taiwan, the situation will be very close, but he is now in the construction should be from this year, the second half of the year, he will officially put his investment, operation to contribute, some revenue and profit.

It is said that our precious metals come from a few pieces, one is an industrial customer us, to help the customer to clean some of his precious metals, the workpiece to get some of the precious metals. That is because there are some so-called customers may sell or exchange parts we will get some, the gold can do the sale, just in the course of the sale we have just mentioned through the borrowing of a transaction, the model to avoid the risk of our price. So this is the place, we have to suppress the price risk, that is, we may be able to help customers to do these, some of the services, some of the related costs or services, such as say that we can collect more from customers, called Premium parts, so that part of the electronic waste here presents the margin rate, is about 1-5%.

There are two types of electronic waste, one is the customer, we charge the customer processing fee, and then help him deal with his electronic waste. Another model is that we go to bid or buy, these electronic waste comes in for recycling, then get some of the inside, say waste hardware or waste plastic parts, then some precious metals, then do a sale or processing part of the back end. Yes, that is why we say that with our customers, customers charge processing fees, this should be the trend in Taiwan should be the price is also going up.

But whether it is to pay the processing fee or to buy the part, these, after the disassembly of these, whether it is the waste hardware or the precious metal part of the ownership is actually the part of the increase, we can do some more to make it, such as to say that precious metal, and then do a sale later. The cost of such costs will be relatively low compared to what we normally are now, because the price of the gold now is in constant, up, so, I got these wastes in the past, through a certain amount of time to do the recycling and refining of these precious metals, the cost of these precious metals will be relatively low.

OK. This year, about 10 kg to 15 kg is from, the electronic waste, can be calculated, because the proportion is not high, not much. OK. Thank you.

There are other advanced investment questions. Is that the revenue from that precious metal, which is the most important part. No, it should be mainly from the electronic waste we just mentioned, the revenue, which is the most important part. No, it should be mainly from the electronic waste we just mentioned, the revenue, which is the most important part.

We are talking about the electronic waste we call the waste debt here some of it, in fact, the cost, and after the treatment of some of the spreads we can do to sell, its margin may be maintained, about 4 to 5 percent. So we that, the waste metal, recycled metal is mainly, which is more metal than. Just mentioned, for example, for example, iron, copper, copper may be a bit a lot of a block because of your motherboard, crush it.

The glass is then crushed with copper powder. Then include some of the iron or tin. With the copper part is the basic metal. Well, so if the copper price rises.

It is better for us than for them, for the truth of the copper can be said. There is no cost. From the electronic waste to come here, we can. More copper in the recycling of electronic waste and the subsequent increase in copper prices.

For us, there is a greater benefit. So we now know, for example, a year of recycling bins, or how much aluminum this is about.

I may be able to give you this number for a while. OK, so that's it.

If I had to spend the whole year, I'd say it's going to be a big deal, but I think it's going to be a big deal now.

It is possible to double. For example, now 10 million to 20 million. One of the revenue contribution. 10 million is an example or the real data. Just to mention that about five cases in Taiwan, one of the revenue in about a year is about 10 million. OK That's it.

What is Gross Margin? I just mentioned that it's probably between 40% and 50%. Understand. So if you see it in the coming years, there's no way to say it. What's the revenue target?

Here it should be said that we expect to put the scene in three years. The device capacity is one. The number of devices is probably five to six. Five to six MegaWatts. Now it's about 1.7.

Because the new mainland factory has not been built yet, it should be about 1.7. So it should be possible to flip two to three more times. OK I'm sorry for that. I just understood the error that I said it. The new building material may not be. Maybe not asking VRPB that we don't have the use CLGM.

The CLGM contributes a lot to that revenue. In fact, he probably won't contribute much this year, because he built the industry last year. Good, there will be some. There will be some.

Will be corrected. Duration. Will be corrected. Right. Organized.

What to do. Yes. You want to wheelchair. That is. radial T streams is not what I am talking about right now.

This is the share of revenue from flying. Although we have already said that we may have a chance to pull around 15-20 this year.

His percentage must be effective. I may be less than 1% of the cost of flying. Well. I'm flying mainly or just mentioned. From waste money. Some of these electronic waste disposal fees.

After that, these parts are cleaned and processed. Cleaning service fee experience fee. With the sun here, to form part of this expensive part of me.

So, this year's flying growth, probably a large part of that is from that, flying, that the price of the metal rises, and the amount should be increased.

Increased processing volume. Oh processing volume increases. It is expected to be expensive this year. That is to say, the amount of waste treatment will increase relatively. So it will become this year.

No matter what the cost is, it's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you.

Some of them may not be able to do so, while others may not be able to do so. That is to say, this is where we want to do so, but there is still some with our clients.

It is not exactly the same business. The price of the treatment is the same. It is now some people. Waste treatment. So I don't know what our company is here.

There may not be. It is not easy to scale up like this. Some of them are actually called big clients. Some of them are. I think we want to scale up more positively.

The open source part is added. Add some new orders to ours. Increase some of ours. So some of the prices. Adjust the above may be loosened. That is, of course, if we are in the future.

There is more than one level of productivity utilization. It may be these considerations that you just talked about. Then do price adjustment. Yes, so we now have about how much capacity utilization is. There is a number.

Some of these individual statistics are statistically accurate. The current word is, one of my own opinion is that productivity utilization is still low. OK, so this bottleneck of productivity utilization. He is mainly where it is.

The one who built the house, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, the one who built it, and the one who built it.

The middle of that is through the artificial part. So there are people. The factory part is because we built a new part in 2017. This is a new headquarters here in the building of the factory. Other production capacity is only large. So capacity.

Some of the production capacity of the plant or equipment is not a bottleneck. It may be a part of the person. OK The CFO has that for this year.

I think it's a good idea to do this year, but we've been doing it for years, and we've been doing it for years, so of course we're going to do it this year.

But maybe the first half of the year won't be a good one. Because I want to be the first half or the last part of what we adjusted. But in the second half I think there should be some more obvious. Because include some of the certifications that we're currently passing in the second half of this year, there will be some final parts. So in the second half I think there will be a lot of bets on the revenue of some new customers and new orders.

So in some parts of the profit should be better than the first half of the second half of the year. I think that's bad for that revenue. It should probably be maintained in the present moment. Maybe this year's number is almost the same. OK Just mentioned the new customer.

Which type of client? uh, the third type of client. OK, so we're talking to them about some precious metals to clean these businesses. For the part cleaning, we'll start with the part cleaning. Then the finished precious metals we'll help him do some recycling and refining.

Then they turned it into something else they needed, just like a pre-experience or some related applications that were being used.
