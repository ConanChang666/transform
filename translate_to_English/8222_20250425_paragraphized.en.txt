Welcome to invest in advanced securities to establish first gold securities. Join the legal meeting of Baoyi Technology Co., Ltd. today. The legal meeting will be officially started.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the Chief Executive Officer of today. He is the Vice President of Hu Shuxian. Mr. Wu will introduce you to the investment in advance of the current operation status.

It's our pleasure to be here today to give you an overview of our company. That's a question for the presentation. If you have any questions about the presentation, feel free to ask. We've officially started.

That's because this briefing is actually very basic. I just updated the number of updates every year. So if you've heard it before, maybe I'll hear it again. That's because I just learned. It seems like a lot of people are coming to follow our company for the first time.

So maybe we don't understand our company. So if you've heard of investment friends, be patient. Well, our company was established a long time ago. We started as a small company. We went public on January 27th, 104. It's been 10 years this year.

That's why I've been a spokesperson for 10 years. Our capital is more than 600,8 million. Now you can see the area of our factory. It's probably 4285 pings. But I have to make a small update. That's 10 years ago.

On the opposite side of our factory, we bought a small factory of 632 pings. I will go back and introduce the operation of it. What is the difference? Then the latest progress was on 31 December last year. We bought it again.

We bought a factory. The land plant. It was about 2700 pings. That was because it was closed last December 31st. So it was also in Xinying Industrial Zone. So we are now.

In the entire Xinying Industrial Zone. We are in the entire Xinying Industrial Zone. We have three plant areas. This is the 4285 pings of the factory. Opposite. 632 pings.

We also bought this plant about 2700 pings. So now we have three places. So I want to talk about this revenue in 2024. About 90%.

15% are exports. We are basically foreign engines. We are mainly parts of aircraft engines. The domestic revenue is only about 5%. The revenue is about 2% from Hanson. That is because Hanson is a customer service worker.

So that means we only charge processing fees. There is no material. So its revenue is relatively small. We do fly well. There are engine parts for commercial jets. There are engine parts for that military trainer.

This is a basic introduction. Then this is the layout of our factory area. Our address is No. 1, Lane 18, New Highway, Industrial Zone. The factory next to us is No. 18 New Highway. So it is opposite. It is two minutes away.

We bought the new 2700 ping. It is the engine part of the industrial zone along the new highway. Walk inside the industrial zone. 800 meters away. So it is very close to our company.

So we bought it for later expansion. We went. We all know. I was affected by the pandemic from 2020 to 2022. Three years later, because the whole world was afraid to fly.

Then take a plane to isolate here for 14 days. Then come back to isolate another 14 days. It's about a month that you won't do anything. So that's very unfortunate. Then the epidemic just started abroad. Taiwan is very serious.

The two of them had only a day or two before, so we had to give them a call, and they had to give us a call, and we had to give them a call, and we had to give them a call.

He said the pandemic was over. So no one knew what was going on at that time. So the revenue for those three years was very low. That was a very downward trend.

I think we lost about 100 million in the second year of the pandemic. I think this can be seen in the published earnings report. That 2022 is the third year of the pandemic.

What is an isolated person. Then the parents can start to take leave. Then pay the salary. So it's really sad. It's about the first year after the pandemic, it's 2023.

Revenue began to recover. It grew from 450 million to 680 million. It then increased from 2024 to 2023. It was 1424 million. So it was probably more revenue than last year. It was about 140 million.

So the YY is 20. 52. The first half of 2023. We have already made up for the cumulative losses. So the reported earnings for 2023 are 0. 88. But the cumulative losses are deducted first.

So we can only send 0. 46. We actually send 0. 3. That earned 1. 49 in 2024. So this is in the published earnings. Everyone should.

This is the opposite of our factory. This is the opposite of Highway 18, which has 632 pings. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

Here's a re-routing paragraph-by-word transcript:. Then there's a warehouse for two more three-dimensional inspections. Why? Because we gave to one of the Safran group customers the SAB, the customer in Belgium. The product he gave to him was a bit of a picture after the Tairing, this Tairing thing, the process is relatively simple, he can just wash his car and then ship it directly. And it's a customer service, so we're here to make this product stand alone, because it's only the two processes that make it easier to clean the bed.

This is our new camp in Tainan, and the new camp is north of Tainan, so you have to sit on the north side of Tainan, so if you want to visit our factory, do not sit at the high-speed rail station, because we are very far from Tainan, because we are in the north of Tainan, about half an hour drive from Chiayi High-speed rail station. If you come from Rende, it may take an hour to reach the congestion car.

So we gave to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. I want to give to the U.S. the most recent topic of tariffs is the topic of tariffs, and I often get people to ask me what the U.S. increases tariffs mean to our company, and then we deliver to the U.S. part of our trade conditions are FOB for 20 years, so I just deliver to the airport. So we have no tariffs for U.S. customers at present, so we are looking for some development, so we are still not going to ship to the previous way, so it seems to have no effect at the moment.

So during this period, we also have to take some measures that we will be missing because some employees may leave and then we do not have enough time to fill up, then we ask the staff to work together to complete the special rest as much as possible you can use your special rest, because the special rest is also in accordance with the provisions of the old accounting law, so we ask employees since there is no so much work to do as much as possible and then some employees with poor performance have less than 10 of the previous actions we have done before, so the three years during the epidemic there is no business ineffective working time is about one year more than 20 million, so the unit cost is also relatively high.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how the content of these punctuated transcriptions is rationally segmented to make it easier to read.

First of all, I read through the entire transcription to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses the different processing processes in the manufacturing industry, the certification requirements for special processes, and the relevant equipment and management methods. Users may want to group these content according to logical relationships, such as combining sentences from the same topic into paragraphs, while keeping the sequence of timestamps. Next, I need to identify the subject of each sentence and determine which sentences can be combined into paragraphs. For example, the parts of stamping, hot-pressing, and hydraulic forming can be combined into a paragraph, followed by the certification requirements for special processes, and then a description of processes such as heat treatment, flow testing, sand blasting spraying, etc.

It is important to note that the timestamps mentioned by the user may not need to be kept in the final paragraph transcript, but must be ensured that all sentences are arranged correctly. In addition, the user may want to have an appropriate transition between paragraphs to make the content more coherent, but can not add any new content or rewrite the original sentences on request, only adjust the structure. During the process, I need to check if there are missing sentences and make sure that each sentence is correctly grouped into the corresponding paragraphs. For example, the parts of special process certification may involve multiple sentences and need to be grouped together.

At the same time, check if there are any formatting errors or typographical problems, to ensure that the paragraph type transcription of the output is clear and easy to read. </think> [ Paragraph type transcription]: This is the part that is made by less people in the country. Then the bark processing is a complete piece of metal, by stamping the hydraulic press to form.

But this is a special process, which is your customer's order, and then you only need to use any one of this special process, no matter what, your special process must be certified. Not only are the processes certified, some even the workers who operate the process must be certified. For example, like Han Jian, our A staff has A license, he can only sell A, B this product he can't sell, and B staff has B license to sell. So we have their license in the work area, so the customer once realized that this person is doing this Han Jian work, he is not a license.

The process of spraying is a process that allows the metal surface to resist chemical changes and strict temperatures, that is, it can operate under high temperature for a long time, and then improve the efficiency of the engine. Then is the laser cutting, like the metal of this whole piece to be formed through various processes, you must first cut a profile, so we use the laser cutting machine. The inspection is to remove the oil on the workpiece, because if you have a visual car holding it while working, you want to see that it is a cutting fluid, but you have to go to the following process, you have to inspect the process, make it clean, so that the next process can go to the next process.

X-ray inspection is like you can't see inside a cup, so we have to pass the X-ray inspection to know that there are flaws. Because we do the part of the aircraft engine, so there are very strict requirements, so you have to be certified to pass. And our tolerance is a few, you should hear it, one is 0.0 01mm, you know a large workpiece, and then its tolerance is only a few, you know that it is very difficult to do.

This is a special process item for every special process. The one line on the left is our client, and he has to be certified as long as he is covered by this special process. So this is the one that the client has for which special process is certified. One of the Netcap is a third notarial unit certification, we usually go to apply for Netcap certification, but there is a Netcap certification just to say that your company has a certain basis, but the customer wants to give you the order, as long as the order is useful for the special process, the customer still needs to get his certification.

This is the number of equipments. That is, the number of special processes related to the special processes, the number of special processes. Well, the one is Pridehweenie, I just mentioned that we gave to the US is Pridehweenie, the manufacturer of the F16 engine, and the manufacturer of the A320NIR, the one is LiP-A, the PW-1100, and the manufacturer of the PW-1100.

OK, so let's take a look inside. Well, this is our revenue, I just talked about the components and the board, then I would like to explain a little more about the coolant, it really is the board, because it is this coolant this thing because it is a consumable, and it needs to be replaced every once in a while.

So it's much bigger, so we separate it from each other. But in fact, you see that the combination is the three pieces have, about 51%, that the single component accounted for 24%, the board and the coolant are both boards, about 24%, so the combination accounted for about half, the boards accounted for 1 4 points, and the mechanism accounted for 1 4 points. The coolant is because it's a consumable, and its volume is relatively large, we currently have three customers with coolants, one is Hanshin's coach, we hand the coolant, and then one is CFN56. I want to talk about CFN56, because not everyone understands, it's the A320 with the Boeing 737, this is the most popular model, so it accounts for 70% of the whole aircraft.

But we all know that the problem that Boeing created before was limited to the FAA, so it seemed like the new engine was slowing down, so the old engine showed signs of that, so we now have these old engines, and we are still going out, so we gave them to CFN56, either A320 or Boeing 737. But the new engine A320 NEO and the Boeing 737 MAX, we only have A320 NEO, to Prede Huyen's PW1100, there is a cooling sheet, so we gave them to PW1100. So I guess there are three customers, there are cooling sheet shipments. This is the expansion of the engine, this is the intake fan, the high-pressure compression band and the turbine segment, which is equivalent to the air inlet, compression it expands, then generates the energy, then the exhaust, then the exhaust, and then moves forward.

One engine has more than 30,000 parts, so we probably focus on the parts of the heat section more, then the negligible alloy, solid-base alloy, titanium alloy, stainless steel, these are some materials, usually more negligible materials. Then you also know that from 2024 to 2023, we will increase the turnover of 140 million, then YY 20%, 20. 52%, then our gross margin also from 20%, 2023 to 22% in 2024.

This is a cool piece, which I have just mentioned, the other engine of our A320NIR, the other engine other than Lip A, PW1100, we give Prime Queenie, you see that it starts with PW, is the abbreviation of Prime Queenie, this is the engine it produces, so, we give it only 10 centimeters, but you see how many holes there are, and its tolerance is small, and it is also measured at a rate of flow, and many special processes, which we give five parts. That is CF-156, the old engine of the cool piece, this is only 8 centimeters, then a whole piece of metal, to break it up, and then there is the middle, there is the forming, there is space, and then there are some holes, so it is relatively difficult.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim: Well, that's a combination. That's three. That's all there is to it. This is part of the A320NEO. This is also the A320NEO.

This is also the A320NEO. This is the Boeing 737 MAX. It's all part of the new engine. Well, that CF-156 knows it's the old engine. That's because I just talked about it.

There is no such thing as an empty space, so the old ones use these engines with CF-156. There are signs of the year, so some of them are part of it, so we still have to go out, just not as much as before.

That's because they already have End of life. So these customers. This will reduce its suppliers. A previous part may have two or three suppliers. It's now only to save management costs.

So we're going to focus on one supplier, so we've got one of these products. We've all got one hundred percent. That's all we do. That's all we do. Well, that's a part of the A350.

The A350 is a dual-walker aircraft. It's bigger. It's the Rolls-Royce engine. It's the one I gave to STS. It's the PW-1500. See you all at PW.

It is a PW. The engine produced by Preda-Hueni. But we give KHI. It is the same as I give KHI first. It does other assembly. And then to Preda-Hueni.

So the end customer is Preda-Hueni. Then this thing. It's A220. A220 is a little smaller than A320Nil. It's about 100 to 149 people. Then A320Nil is a single-walker aircraft.

But it's bigger than it is. There are about 165 to 244 people. So A220 is a relatively small shuttle. That's it, but it's sold well. So we've done a lot of KHI recently. So you want to think about these four.

There are about four total components. Four plus a whole set. Four parts have a total of 30,000 holes. You know how precise that is. And then there are many features.

This is a special process. This is the A220. We gave it to KHI in Japan. Then KHI was also introduced to us by Preda-Hueni. We were introduced to KHI by Preda-Hueni. Then we gave it to him.

He then handed it to Preda-Hueni after the assembly. On this page I put all of our customers, these overseas customers.

AIDC is too strong. It ranks the first one that is not the highest revenue. It's because it starts with A. Then here is the engine we work with.

Then CFM56-5 is A320-7 is the Boeing 737. GENIX is the engine of G1. This is the engine of the Boeing 787 G47-800. This is a larger engine.

It is a G1 company. Then LIB ABC is the most recent A320-NEO. Boeing 737 MAX. C is 919. It is the C919 of China Airlines.

Then PASPOral 20. This is the G1 engine. This is the Bombardier aircraft. Then PW-1001 is the A320-NEO.

The PW-2000 is the Boeing 737-7 which is Bombardier's aircraft. Then the PW-1200 is the engine of that 30 aviation. But the 30 aviation is not selling well. So it has been discontinued. Then the PW-1500 is A220. Just mentioned.

The PW-2000 is Boeing 757. The PW-4000 is 747-767-777. Then CEN 146. It is a shuttle bus with a dichotomy of less than 100 people. We deliver to SAFRAN.

We don't deliver to Russia. Then BLUE CRYST. This is a small plane from 8 to 16 people. TRACK SWB is A350. The engine of the dual-walker aircraft. This is Rolls-Royce's engine.

But we gave it to SPS. So he gave it to Rolls-Royce. Then V2500. This is the engine part of the A319-320-321. This is the engine for rescue. Now it's probably replaced by the A320-NEO and the Boeing 737.

But there is still some quantity. Then the bottom one is a part of the power plant. But now it is no longer there. This is the only part that we put on the plane, but it has not been done in years.

This is also the key to our customers' cooperation with which engine fields we work. Also, look at financial data. Here we can see in 110 years of 111 years. It is three years of the pandemic. You see that we have less investment in the last three years. So our debt ratio remains at 412 43%.

Then, about 45% will be raised by 2023. Because the pandemic has passed since then. Our orders have all come back. Then there are some signs of expansion. So we started customizing some capital expenditures. Some of them are too old to be replaced.

There are some automation features. Then there are more people-savings. There are machines that need to be increased due to expansion capacity. So we started this year. Because you know that some machines need to be cleaned like Japan at that time. It takes 13 months to come in.

There is also a queue, because the Japanese currency at that time was depreciated. No. Everyone queued up to buy a Japanese machine. It took more than a year to get in. It is not necessary to get in.

It's also called Grandpa's. So it takes a long time to get in. Some of the customized machines will take about half a year. So it's half a year to a year. Then we start a lot of investment. We have a total capital expenditure in the last two years.

I counted about 200 million. That's why we increased our debt to 57% last year. That's because we bought a new plant on December 31.

If you are looking for a good price for your next trip to China, you may be looking for a good price for your next trip to China. The walkway passenger plane is the largest amount, which is here in China about 22%, but the empty space should be relatively not affected at the moment, good, that for such presentations, there are no problems, then I will do a simple report with you soon, I hope that the first time to listen to a brief brief presentation of our company can have a more general understanding, okay, thank you, okay, that if there is no problem in advance, then we are here today, thank you for your investment advanced participation, good, thank you all.
