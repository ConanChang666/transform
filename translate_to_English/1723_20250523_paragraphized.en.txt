This is the only professional cotton chemical factory in China, the only professional factory in Taiwan, and the only professional factory in Taiwan, we have a unique position in the world in the graphite furnace. Introduce the current company's shareholders, there are some changes in the top ten shareholders of the company, there are some changes in the ranking and shareholding ratio of the company, and there are some changes in the ranking and shareholding ratio of the other shareholders.

The new entry list for the top ten shareholders is the investment account of Van Gogh Emerging Markets Index Fund, which is currently ranked in the top ten. In fact, he has been on the list for a long time in our list of shareholders, but recently there have been changes to the top ten. The other part has also been raised in this part of the CCB employee share trust, which is currently ranked eighth, with a shareholding ratio of 0.9%.

The hydrocarbon series is the part of the charcoal and charcoal carbohydrates. In addition, the part of the soft liquid hydrogen is further processed as an application of our fine charcoal materials. In this part of the so-called fine charcoal material, we use the liquid hydrogen as a raw material for our fine charcoal materials, the current main products include the fine strength of hydrogen to the carbon cell we call the ball, or the contact of graphite carbon cell is the addition material of lithium batteries.

In addition, we will produce two new products from advanced carbon materials and square graphite blocks. In the whole fine charcoal material industry chain, we may be able to briefly introduce the value of the whole industry chain. The price of soft liquid hydrogen from the preceding raw materials is about 0.5, 0, 6 kilos, so if the production to the next to the carbon fiber ball, we can sell a kilogram of products, about two kilos of more than. If we can do the connection to the graphite carbon fiber ball can be about 10 kilos, then the advanced carbon material can reach even more than 30, 40 kilos, so the whole high-quality trading of fine charcoal materials is very large.

The carbon materials of this kind of medium are some of the characteristics that are not easily achieved with other competitive materials, which is an application that allows us to have its uniqueness in the market and then can find a niche that corresponds to it. It is a good introduction to the company's operating performance. In the raw material input, in 2024 our coal-fermented oil investment amounted to 2,2% more than a year ago; the new oil part of the investment amounted to 8,40,000 tonnes, decreased by 7.7% compared to the previous year. That in January to April of this year, the coal-fermented oil investment amounted to about 9% less than the same period last year; and the new oil investment amounted by about 14% compared to the same period last year.

In addition, green oil is not easy to expand overseas, mainly a large scale production in China's petrochemical industry, which is as competitive as we are in overseas, which is a bit more difficult here. We will import green oil from Indonesia, Australia, India and other regions this year, we will continue to work hard. In the past three years, a product revenue share analysis, which in 2024 53% of coal-fermented oil, 29% of green oil, carbon 10%, coal-fermented oil is a large proportion of these, among them, mixed oil, soft gold and powder is really three products. This year's 1 to April, our coal-fermented oil share increased to 59%, green oil down to 24%, carbon material is 9%, where the mixed oil accounted for the most of this, this part 21%, and the other soft gold is 18%.

The whole product sales status, coal chemical products, coal-fermented oil products: soft granules are currently an electronic material made of aluminum, then we are all export to Australia, the current demand is very stable. The bulk of the oil is mainly supplied as carbon black is the raw material of automobile tires, then the current export is about half, the export is a little bit more, the export is mainly to Japan.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim texts provided by the user and sort them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I will check the verbatim fragments provided by the verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

Similarly, segmentation is also required for sales ratios, inbound and outbound sales, and sales data for different products. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, sales data for 2024 and subsequent financial metrics may need to be segmented but remain consistent over time.

In addition, information such as financial data and product gross profit margins mentioned by users should be segmented to enhance readability. During the processing process, I will avoid any individual explanations or additions, only structural adjustments. It is necessary to ensure that each sentence is kept in its original position, and that only lines and paragraphs are separated to enhance readability. Finally, check for missing sentences or format errors to ensure that all content is properly converted.

There are more countries to enter and then we began to have the most far in Africa market in the hydrogen uranium products are basically the raw materials of the whole petrochemical industry in the main domestic use is not enough to import the domestic part of the original, so we are all sold mainly in the domestic part of the volume of the use of the current export is Singapore-based silicone carbon part of our 100% supply to domestic customers as a part of the sale of detective carbon materials to graphite carbon ball is a collection of materials that currently accounted for about 7 percent of the total sales in 2024 we will have a significant growth in the domestic market this year to 49% of the export part of the export is based on the mainland China 32% and 19% of the overall sales of the situation is affected by the overall battery capacity of the remaining in China. This is why we expect to have a relatively large growth in the second half of the year in connection with carbon fiber. This is basically one of our intermediate materials, so we have also planned to supply this high-grade carbon fiber to the existing customers. There are some moments when this link to carbon fiber ball is about 45 to 55 out of the mainland China, and the static force is mainly used as graphite detectants such as chain electrode stick static processing, which is currently 100% out of this year, but this year part of this year because we have a large demand for electric steel chain is falling and the price of the competition is very intense. This year's total consolidated revenue of 16.9 billion yuan was roughly 2.2% before the same period last year, 2.66 billion before the same period last year. The main reason is that the decrease in the price of soft gold is equal to that of soft gold, and the decrease in the price of soft gold, including the decrease in the price of soft gold, is likely to be 10% of the price of crude oil, and the continued decrease in the revenue of our carbon material, which fell to 23% of the total revenue of other operating expenses, and then decreased the total profit from the total market.

This part, of course, goes beyond the recognition of the next month's shareholders' meeting. Agree. Company.

The future is. We will continue to transition to carbon materials. Carbon materials this thing is more inclined to precision manufacturing is a highly customized industry. Therefore, the demand for R&D and innovation is very high.

The investment in research and development. The lack of research funding has also been on the rise. Then we are likely to invest more than 3% of our revenue as one of our research and development purposes.

Some of the government. Production. Industrial Innovation Grants. There are currently plans to be implemented. These grants are very helpful for future development of advanced carbon materials.

China Carbon has a strong R&D team and we have a resource in the steel technology department of our parent company. So we can provide the most suitable products according to the needs of our customers. To provide the most suitable products is one of the advantages of our competition. Part three refers to the company's sustainable development is this part of ESG.

In addition to ESG, we also added risk management projects. Last year, corporate governance evaluations were given there. 101. 29 points. It has been listed for 5 consecutive years between 6% and 20%.

The company has also been selected for the Corporate Governance 100 Index constituents. There are also selected Taiwan green energy and electric vehicle constituents, etc. We have also set short-term and long-term goals in carbon neutrality. That is, some carbon neutral targets have been planned. That is, we are here.

The path map of carbon neutrality. This is a little different from the previous report. In the past, we were using 2018 as a base year for carbon reduction. That would take into account the company's entire carbon material is in a phase of expansion growth.

The part of the carbon explosion. We are currently adjusting to. 2022 Carbon Reduction Benchmark Year. This can be more pragmatic to implement one of our various carbon reduction targets. So the short-term results.

From 2022 to now we have implemented 65 carbon reduction projects. Carbon reduction has reached more than 7000 tons. The future is carbon neutral by 2050. As for the mid-term planning, that is now planned by 2030.

That's what we plan to do by 2030. Achieve a goal of 20% carbon reduction. Towards carbon neutrality in 2050. In the last three years we have carried out a greenhouse gas inventory of some of our small steel mills are deep green. We can see clearly.

This part of carbon emissions continues to decline, which can be seen as a company. An effort in reducing carbon emissions is an effort in Ping An. That part is a relatively light green part. Because there is an increase in capacity in the expansion, there is an increase in carbon emissions. No matter what the company is doing with carbon emissions.

One execution force is very solid and we're driving it. Here's where our company's ESG implementation has been recognized by all over the years. Some of the awards are related to one. When this part is asked. The fourth part is about a future development of the company.

The future development is mostly about carbon materials. It comes with materials. Advanced carbon materials. There are also three major directions for the rapid adoption of square graphite. In the assembly of materials this piece. We have just mentioned that the most recent development of the collection material is a comparison.

Yes. A relatively large flux. We sold about 500 tons in our second quarter last year. It was expected that the results would gradually increase due to a three-tiered situation among our customers. The fourth quarter dropped to about 200 tons. Our first quarter of this year was about 360 tons.

But at the moment, the whole electronic market. Financing one. A situation in public maintenance. So the price is relatively low. It is especially more serious in China. Overall.

The production capacity is still very high. The future market we mentioned was the first customer of our semi-solid battery. The second part is expected to start production in the second half. We just mentioned that we have the so-called high-end 3C fast charging needs.

We all think that our review material will be. Power Battery. Applications are more prominent. Previously we had not been involved in the 3C product-related applications for a long time. But recently the whole 3C product development.

The so-called fast charging needs. That's it. Fast charging is really for. The battery is a big harm in terms of it. So it's often used in a fast charging way. It can easily affect the battery's life.

But we are now developing this review material for this so-called UF series. It is something that can take into account the needs of fast charging and long life. There are now several high-end phones. The whole test is almost complete. So this part is expected to be in the second half of the year.

It will be obvious success. Growth. That third part is one of the applications that can make the most out of our rehearsal material discharge. It is like an electric car heavy-duty machinery.

Not so high. It is stable in growth but the ratio is relatively low. That is also. Recently, our customers. Apply our review material to do.

There are two extremes of low-capacity but very high power. The other one we look at next. Here we want to introduce one of the conditions they use for the current so-called AI server BPU backup power needs. We can see the one that is actually the biggest or so-called traditional lithium-ion battery LIB. The newly developed project is EDLC, which is our traditional supercapacitor.

An EDLC is a supercapacitor whose capacity is very low, but the part of his power is much better than the lithium battery. The lithium battery performance is a little more in the middle so that the current lithium battery application is quite large. We now have a project called HSC, which is called hybrid Hybrid Supercapacitor, which is called hybrid supercapacitor. The lithium ion capacitor is one of the mains.

The reason for this is that the LIC is the high-capacitance and high-circulation of the high-capacity capacitors, which we can expect to see in the future. In this place, we can see the development of the whole supercapacitor. The bottom of this section is EDLC, which is the traditional supercapacitor.

The most obvious color is the supercapacitor hybrid supercapacitor. The middle is what is called a supercapacitor that's another project that's not ours, so the top and bottom two are actually the objects of carbon-advanced carbon materials that can be supplied. The future of the supercapacitor market will reach 19% of the compound growth rate from 2025 to 2033.

So now the company can reach about 5 tons every month. That we may not be enough in the second half of the year with our current production line of 90 tons. That is currently the 5 tons is mainly for the supercapacitor customers who supply traditional supercapacitors. There are some of our so-called high-voltage projects out there that some customers will probably have a test result in July.

This is why we are currently doing this product at this stage of a recirculating test for our last customers, and only the opportunity to enter the supply chain. We evaluate our advanced carbon materials in the market for a competitive advantage. The new carbon material is actually a kind of activated carbon. The cheapest part is the so-called reproductive, and the reproductive part is that it will use the wild shells to do activated carbon.

So now most of the high-end parts will use the so-called resin for further ignition processing, but the cost of the resin is relatively high. That is to say, we use the so-called borrowed carbon to pay for the raw materials to do such a product. Our characteristics can achieve a characteristic of the resin-related materials, but our price is more advantageous than it is. So we have already passed this expansion on our board in February. Our capacity will be expanded from our current 90 ton future to a 500 ton capacity, which will be completed and put into production in the first quarter of 2027.

This part of the progress is maintained and currently looks like we are in need of urgent demand, so the company here we will try to compress the whole time we will try to hope that we can get this production line to production as soon as possible in six months, otherwise the needs of the customer there will not be able to meet. The last piece of this part of our square graphite fast materials is also one of our potential products. The whole production process has a very difficult process of carbide, and the graphite process is about 3000 degrees.

** Paragraph type transcription**. This is mainly used in a demand for carbonized gas. What we can provide is high-purity toner and high-purity graphite dry pot. Carbonized gas. Because it is a semiconductor for general pure gas.

He is the one who is able to withstand the high voltage current, high frequency, etc. These aspects are better on one side.

He. His cost is relatively high. This is. It may be that the speed of the increase in the carbide industry is very slow. It can be increased in about two weeks. Two or three centimeters with the general pure metal bar.

One of them is a two-year-old, and the other is a one-year-old, and the other is a two-year-old, and one-year-old, and one-year-old, and one-year-old, and one-year-old, and one-year-old.

Because the price is too high. That recent leader company is Wolfspeed. The USA Wolfspeed. For the first two days, there was a mention that he declared bankruptcy because he couldn't go for it.

So today I saw him grow by 30 percent. Is there a company willing. Eat it down the details I'm not sure. But now we have to say that. That's after the product came out of the mainland. The whole price is quite a drop.

The fact is that after this price declines, it is possible to reach a sweet spot above the application. So we expect the future. The application of carbon dioxide in the so-called electric vehicle here in the electric installation. Should be more mature. That is, for this price decline is for carbon dioxide.

"They are the ones who have been given the good news, and they are the ones who have been given the good news, and we are the ones who have been given the good news, and the ones who have been given the good news are the ones who have been given the good news, and the ones who have been given the good news are the ones who have been given the good news."

We see this as a good opportunity for us. In addition to this, the Board of Directors has set up a mass-producing storage furnace.

And so are we. Push it. We build a factory that does the same thing. That we will do in this new project. Including the base machining of this piece then there is the forming of this piece. Hope.

It is possible for us to do all of this. This is the whole of this. The whole of the available items can be completed. So we hope. It is in line with the domestic carbonized gas industry. Then build a supply chain across the whole of the land.

Carbon dioxide is the only company in China that owns professional graphite furnaces. So we are confident that in this regard we will be able to. Replace imported goods. Become the whole. Carbon dioxide semiconductors. An important part of the entire supply chain.

In addition, we may be particularly concerned about the recent U.S. tariffs, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on carbon. In terms of tariffs, we have cotton school. The market is generally based on Asia and Australia.

We. The final product of our customers. The percentage of going out of the United States is also very low. The single item may be below 5% this effect is very slight. As for this piece of our carbon material, our customers are mainly in Asia. That is the only one now.

A small portion is sold directly to the U.S., but one of the Asian customers is here. Middle-end products. There are still parts that will be sold to the U.S., but this part we lack.

We find it difficult to assess an impact on it. Overall, we think. Peer-to-peer tariffs have a slight impact on carbon. That is even if both sides of the US and China.

It's not a problem, but even if we don't have one, we have a few.

Customer. Part. Peer tariffs have little impact on us. But the problem of direct sales is little, but we're more concerned about whether or not. If China's products have high tariffs on the part of China, it's impossible to sell to the United States.

Yes. There may be a situation in the surrounding area that the product will be overflowing with this part. It may damage the surrounding market conditions, which is the part we are more worried about.

Finally, the impact on exchange rates. The impact of the exchange rate on carbon dioxide is relatively large. The percentage of exports of carbon dioxide is about 45%. The majority of these are denominated in U.S. dollars.

And appreciation. billions of dollars. That carbon's individual revenue impact is about 2.2%. That gross profit margin affects 0.5 percent. That's the first thing we've got to adjust for the overall exchange rate.

Try to avoid U.S. dollar denominated. That first part we're going to speed up the entire collection cycle. That reduces that. The U.S. dollar has a currency rate fluctuation at the time it is posted.

We only have 30 days in the cycle on average, so it's not long. There are some open LCs that we will take for granted. Take pre-sale. Foreign exchange methods to lock the exchange rate in advance. That's just saying.

One of the conditions of a boom may be that we may still have something to deal with. There may still be a case of a loss. The third part, of course, we want to say. Try to expand some of the market needs. Hope to increase the value of the entire product.

Reduce exchange rate fluctuations for us. This effect. The carbon material products of the entire medium carbon material are sourced from advanced carbon materials from negative polar materials. Pick from square graphite quickly. This part is a vision towards the future of the company. We go to a friendly and friendly environment for our green.

This year, we will be part of the soft grains in the next month. The principle plan is 8. 5 boat 8. 5 boat is the point of 5 boat, so there will be some relatively small capacity about half of the quantity of the boat. In short, there are 7 boats plus 3 boats combined about 8. 5 boat in the first half of this year, we will have in the first half of January, and there will be 4 boats in the second half of this year, and the current part of the plan will be in the first half of this year. 3% of the charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal 13% charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal charcoal charcoal char cocoal charcoal char cocoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal char cocoal charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal 13% charcoal charcoal charcoal charcoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal charcoal char cocoal char cocoal 13% char cocoal 13% char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal charcoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char cocoal char coal char cocoal char cocoal This is the first time that we have been able to sell all of our products in Taiwan because of the lack of domestic capital, but because our price is the same as the international market. If the price declines, of course, we are also linked to the international price. This is the part of our supply of light oil is also linked to the international price, so this part is that we are afraid that if he is a down trend, we may get a relatively high price of raw materials and then ship the product will be relatively cheap, but future issues we just talk about the East-America trade war that may have a big impact on this country. We are not afraid that if he falls a trend, we may get a relatively high price of raw materials and then the product will be shipped in a relatively low price, but a future issue we just mentioned that the East American trade war may have a serious impact on this side of the East American tariff war, the time we can't sell to North America, so the price declines very much like a low price of $650, then the price will immediately bounce back like $750, the whole scenery or not so strong, and then we have some of the first price of the whole price is not enough, then we will have to follow the international market, so we will have an impact on the price, but we will be linked to the international price of our upstream price, so we will be afraid that if we will be more than the price of the future price. If the market price of the market price is higher than the market price of the market price of the market price of the market price of the market price of the market price of the market price of the

relatively high price of raw materials and then the product will be shipped at a relatively low price, but there is a future issue that we just mentioned that East American trade war may have a serious impact on the side of the big price of raw materials and the price will not fall, so we are concerned that if he falls, we may get a relatively high price of raw materials and then the product will be shipped at a lower price, but in the future we will have a very serious problem that East American trade war can not sell to the severe price of tariffs in North America. ***** ***** *****
