In the market, the sailors of rumor from 2023 to 2024 has always existed since the existence of the ecological environment is like this. At present, we think that the most recent problem is the GB200 of a delay I think, whether it is 200 or 300 is a provider, I think that the influence of the whole market is not as good as it is, we see the whole market is not a rumor, and I don't know why there are these rumors, but in the first quarter of 2025 we have created a very good performance We think we will create a very good performance.

## Script finishing. **Q&A content**. Meyer gives you recurse exercises to drastically reduce interview. We're tough on this person. She does Garrah l studies this q2 abilities. Vice President I'm Amber.

That's because there are no other questions. I'd like to continue to ask you. That's what the company is about. Now it's like a GPU. General Accelerator and it might be like an ASIC. This kind of development.

I don't know if you can provide one. That's what you're saying about these two trends. Some of them are not one of them, some of them are. They may be more positive here.

Or, in fact, two booming. Both are equally positive for the company. Thank you. I mentioned it to all investors in this two monthly reports. Trump is a comprehensive one.

From General Server. to an increasingly booming Edge Server. to Blackwell. to GP200 300. GP includes ASIC. The first one covered.

One depth and breadth of a diversify. It is becoming more and more wide. So the company business field. It is a comprehensive diversify. We are not the focus. Disperse it with a variety of risks.

But what I want to say is that in this field, Mr. Trump really is more and more powerful. So you see this kind of revenue follows this. All the revenue looks like that.

It is a natural thing, it is a natural thing, it is a natural thing, what is patent is natural, and what is patent is not important. It is a research and development result of your past.

"This is the time when we will be able to do this," he said, "and this is the time when we will be able to do this, and we will be able to do that."

It is good, but it is not good; it is good; it is good; it is good; it is good; it is bad; it is good; it is bad; it is bad; it is bad; it is bad; it is not good.

Thank you. Agrade Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See you again.

får? vad? thigh? Anthony? I'm telefone francacco. О ahead baldi is good.

I would like to send a mobil aan in May. think pun Bnikov Thank you. i yours. web Voice so this is the product. You are a ほ은. Гд gar is.

Music. Chunwu was planning more than two years ago. We now have a lot more than this one. It should be said two years ago. Who wants to go to this place. Then invest in artificial products.

The cost is so high, it should be one of our own plans, so so such a high-tech product, I think to go to the right place.

This is the first of its kind in the world to come, and the last of its kind in the world to come, and the last of its kind in the world to come.

The market is right where you want to go. So you say to go there cost is higher. It's not going to make money. I don't think it's possible. But we're going to prepare for next year.

This is a good idea to start production next year or next year. The problem is only discussed at this time. If all AI. ODM production is all there. Of course it is best.

It is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do. Our interview is the right time. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do.

After that, we will still be set up in Europe. Until the end of the world will be set up. So step by step, do not go out first. The next question is good. The second half of the year you have the opportunity to see.

Price dynamics to more than 100%. I followed it last week. Last week there was evidence that our capacity utilization was up to 160%.

So at the moment. No problem. UTR can reach 120%. Then add Houston this can reach 20%. We think it is. Support is possible during this period.

An internal one is a need for the outside. Good then the next question is. For the benefit of AI server. NVIDIA-based contribution follows. Collectively, Ameron's TRN. Is the TR for the company's revenue.

We do not have one. Packdown's analysis. It is not appropriate to put the company's own internal. Like some kind of industry are put the company. All information is publicly available there. We are based on the position of shareholders.

We didn't do anything. I started talking last year. I was also doing an analysis of any Packdown. You're ready for homework. Really, one new platform out.

You're talking about the opportunity. That's the current home. The first priority choice is Kawabu. The next good question is, how much is the company's share of GB200 upside-down market. Is it still available on GB300?

In fact, we've all been there. The whole company is hundreds of projects at the same time. NV is just one. We go from GB200. It's always changing.

Because of decades of technology. In two years to shrink. There must be a lot. Eight students are required to correct. So includes GB200. Including GDC.

And GB300. It's been fixed to fix the fixing changes. The problem is the same for each family. It's getting faster. **Note: **Note: **Note:**

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that the user-provided rules are not deleted, rewritten, or condensed with any original text. The user emphasizes that all verbatim sentences must be retained, so I want to check the verbatim to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. Next, I will look at the verbatim fragments of the user-provided verbatim and note that each sentence has timestamps, but the user requests are paragraphs, so the timestamps need to be removed. At the same time, note that the consistency between sentences may need to be adjusted according to the context, but the user explicitly states that the order cannot be rewritten or adjusted, so it must be strictly arranged in the original order.

For example, if multiple sentences belong to the same topic or problem, I will combine them together to form a paragraph. However, it is necessary to make sure that no strings are added or change the original intention. During the process, I need to pay special attention to some possible errors, such as whether the format of the timestamp is correct, whether there are duplicated or missing sentences. For example, in the fragments provided by the user, there are gaps between some timestamps, such as [1371-1372. 94] and [1372. 94-1375. 10], but it is necessary to check if there are missing sentences.

In addition, some sentences may be wrong because of speech recognition errors, such as whether or not Kawabu is correct, or whether or not the "113 Year" should be "113 Year", etc., but the user requests not to be rewritten, so even if there are errors, it is necessary to keep the same paragraph. In addition, the user mentions that some sentences may belong to the same question or answer, which needs to be merged into a paragraph. For example, on the GB300 structure, multiple sentences describe different components, should be merged into a paragraph.

Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim, check whether all sentences are properly preserved, no omissions or errors, and ensure that the format conforms to the user's requirements. If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the original verbatim again to ensure accuracy. </think> [ Paragraph verbatim verbatim:] That Kawabu has a very high market share in GB200, the GB300 architecture and 200 architecture is different from that it has more power shield and cap shield. power shield is a power plant, with four power plants, and one to four cap shield is a capacitance plant.

The next question is whether the company is going up and down, not bad, not bad, not bad. The next question is whether the future expansion of Taiwan and the United States can be set up in the United States? We have the F1 license in Houston, United States, in December, we got it, so say that environmental protection part of we are still in the assessment, or in the assessment, we have a sequence, which does not need to worry about the outside. The next question is 244Q, and 2025 has the opportunity to increase to 100%.

In 2024, the 4Q 80% to 90%, should be close to 80% to 90%, 2025 to 100 points will grow, 2025 do not need to talk about YYG, just to say where to go, we will try to try to try to help shareholders to win the most profit. As the last 20 years listed in our shareholders, all of our shareholders are making money, that is, that is, the integrity of the problem, our company is integrity, we do not like to say that the past two years have been rumored to be corrected, do not do anything to change my actions, I will not go to visit its natural, natural is the most beautiful, so I just said that we have planned out, do not worry about 2025 26.

The next question is whether it will be possible to further explain the time of plant planning in the U.S. and Europe, and whether it will be possible to explain the current target production and estimated production time? The U.S. plant is next year, which accounts for nearly 20% of the total expected production time, then I just said no more write, I just added a sentence, the European it does not need to write, the future goal of the world including Europe will also be set up factory, now there is no plan, and now the Ming Xuan first.

So we can do anything, we can do the gun, we can do all kinds of things. One of the architecture is robust, and after these hardware architectures matured in the future, the talent is nearly 450 engineers, we will go to some so-called IoT transformations to develop a combination of hardware interface. Because the future is the existence of these factors, you will not be lonely.

That's my heritage, I've been helping shareholders save money, but it's also creating the greatest benefit. You see our expenses, if we say anything successful, or what projects, you see us in the past few years, saving money, spending money, and using the knife to create effect, it's very good. We think we're still trying to do this, this body, thisking center body, has been in the city, I believe his cash flow will be faster and faster.

What do you think is the best way to do this? Is it a key factor? There are too many factors that affect gross profit, just because you have the economic scale of your business, the cost of quality, the cost of manufacturing, the kind of design cost, and the kind of factors. I said, Trump has 20,000 products to improve, say that Maoli is so hard to do, now is to this place, we try to do it, we try to do it, we try to do it, show a state of business, share with shareholders, it is our expertise, we are to make money robots.

Please take the time to open your own microphone to ask questions, or to leave your questions in the chat room. The Minister is sorry I am Amber, I would like to ask you that the company in this big customer guide here, should be almost completely unique, but in the market growth, then the customer will not want to go to the diversify supplier, in this case, will you think that there is actually a little chance? Thank you. I want to emphasize that I am not alone, I am not alone, I am not alone. I want to emphasize that monopoly, we are from a total increase of dozens of customers, to explore the future growth space, I am also very confident.

It is the same question that you have asked before, so you will push me to ask the same question, and you will have to listen to the same research, and you will hear the same research, we have been swaying in the past, because we have all the money we need, so we will be very quick to win, in fact, the advanced part of us is пльз, we have to consider, we need to support our field, we have to develop. That's not possible, we may be full of reiterate once, is 10, the rest, the rest, the son, Jose. Minister, there's a legal question in the chat room, ask the use of PowerShift and LabelSignature's slide cabinet, is different from ComputerTray and SwitchTray's design? I just said, the architecture is open, you can go to check, from the previous NVL72 is 198, the same, GP300 and the same, the difference, and I just added these, PowerShift with CutShift.

The next question is, in the last two years, to increase the structure and move to the U.S. factory, in response to the plan for the next few years, will the Sichuan Translation III Fourth Phase expand the factory? Yes, the Sichuan Translation III Fourth Phase will surely expand the factory, and the Sichuan Translation III Fourth Phase will not necessarily be the way to do the Several. The next question is to ask the company GB200, do you see any recent delays, or what changes? I have already said in the name of the installation, here we have one, there is no such, after all, GB200 is completely new in us, there is no way.

I don't know. But I think it's normal for me to talk about it. Bitcoin seems to be normal for you. No, no. Of course, I think it's going to be something that should be a GB200 client.

He waited for 300 more, his budget is still up, he just said that it is not up to him now, and it will be up to him later. He just said that he should use something new, and that should be the case. But in terms of the perspective of Chuan Translation, I am here. I can get 3000, I can get 1500, I can get 1500 mastering. I want to level, very straightforward, I can use the assets.

PowerShell is a market. Tapswell is a market. The legal person mentioned that the Vice President here refers to the 2026 2027 2028 layout of the pretty good, so you can share a little more about the server product planning, and non-server related technical planning, future product planning.

The next legal person asked if Chuan Yishan is its own server upside down, which means that it is possible to power or KFSH, or some IoT moving parts products, twenty-three products. The three-quarter period is really large, with a total holiday 30,000 square meters, he can do a lot, including a lot of Server, because it is the last part of the field, Ichuan Fu headquarter, then two-stage, and then the remaining three-quarter period is only. So good use, so I want to say that there will be a new product in the three-quarter period.

Mr. President, there is a question, can you share the blade and mechanical countertop, in terms of accuracy and weight difficulty? Anything with weight, placed on the mechanical top of the REC, is to do the pull-up repair. It has many functions, the technology is very high, anyway put on the mechanical things, it is, from the previous in order to save costs to use the L-type L plus, to the present a slowly imported back rail. I think that this composite growth, it will become a trend, become a standard, so the opportunity is very big.

Well, the next question is about the amount of planning from the three-piece clothing, when will it open, and there is the extent of the expansion. No, now, how do I know, when the expansion, the announcement is, it must be. Well, the next question is, ask the fourth quarter of the SERVO and the stock's revenue ratio. Oh, 2024, the stock accounted for 17% of the revenue, then the SERVO is about 80 81 seconds.

But the overall growth of Boss still comes from SERVO. The question that follows is how to look at the growth of the storage business this year, the new product will be the direction of the design. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

The GB200 also started in December, a small amount of shipments began in December, and the January is mild, which is average, right. Then, we have to work hard, and then we have to follow. Then he continued to ask the legal person the question, and he said, the amount of gross profit on the second Q4 comes from the factors of the depreciation of the currency.

Yes. I would like to say that GNRO followed AI, they said to each other, will you go away?

That's the trend. That's the way it is. That's the way it is. The question to follow is: Is there a chance to grow from revenue in 25 years? I just started talking to each other Peter very clearly, and I'm going to look at two paragraphs myself. The next question to be asked is: Are companies or developing robots?

The future or we develop new products, slowly, no revenue, don't think about those things. I think our shareholders are, don't want to think too much, and then we try to do a good job, we can meet the basic needs of your shareholders, put the revenue, put the EPS to complete it, and if it is more out of the ordinary weapon, if it is really successful. The following legal person asked: the company's back market share, is it higher than the Bregwell market share?

So someone asked me, "Do you see the future of Powerbreak cabinets? When will you contribute?" Then, one of the legal persons asked, "How many of the MV's are now available?" Then, you asked, "Isn't it MV's?" You asked, "Isn't it MV's?" You asked, "Isn't it MV's?" You asked, "Isn't it ODM's?"

I'm sorry, Mr. President, I can ask you, this one sold to the H20 GPU servers in mainland China, is it the same product for you as H100, H200? Well, each definition is different, each hardware design is different, its architecture is different, in mainland China, their architecture is also divided into many layers, with a structure of what, but a lot. Well, then?

I think the GPU system, China's system, is different, this part we can't, this is a part of a confidentiality agreement with customers, this can't, this part of the GPU in mainland China is obviously obvious, can not do any comment. Well, thank you. There is a question, thank you, this Okay, now E deploy Pluto, then enrada қ, touchdown, just hit bounced process, tournament.

What do you say about GB300? Do you hear about 60% of the capacitance layer of GB300? No, that's not. Well, thanks to the vice president, and continue to open up the time to invest in advanced questions, please guide me.

0. 5shift plus a shift. Excuse me, I don't know. 0. 5shift adds a shift, a shift. Understanding, good, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

I think the scenery is not good, I think, is not a big problem, in the south of this traditional industry is still a problem, won't you be robbed. Well, I want to know, then I want to ask, what direction will the staff of our American factory in this place, or automation ratio will be better than Taiwan will be? For all is universal, the design is different from the point of view, understand, thank you vice president.

What is the situation? What is the situation? What is the situation? What is the situation? At present, several cash positions are quite high, but our distribution ratio is usually only at 50%, then do you want to keep the cash ready to expand substantially? Of course, of course, but a small company after 120 years, will soon reach 20 billion, including transportation products are almost 20 billion dollars of cash, cash, then have their own money, do not need to see to spend with the family, do not have to pay with the bank, how to do it, this is very natural things to make money.

We believe that the future will be a lot different from a product line one investment in a different one in the relevant, but you have to have cash, so prepare not, or how, you can be happy to do a variety of things, all kinds of domination, at least for the whole of Paris, he is a very strong opponent there, how he can how, this kind of backward, you see cash, last year's cash interest income seems to be 67 billion bar, 67 billion 360 days, one day, two million, one day two million.

[3536. 68-3538. 68] You are still at home on Saturdays and Sundays. [3538. 68-3540. 68] Receive one or two monetary interest cash. [3540. 68-3541. 68] So, cash flow. [3544. 68-3543. 68] Last year's public rate income was also quite large. [3546. 68-3547. 68] Also a few dollars.

[3547. 68-3548. 68] So. [3548. 68-3549. 68] Cash flow is getting more and more. [3549. 68-3551. 68] Then the rate of interest rate decreases. [3554. 68-3554. 68] Follow the pace of cash flow. [3554. 68-3558. 68] You'll always have it. [3555. 68-3558. 68] I think it's like a court of 168 billion.

[3558. 68-3560. 68] That is the cash income. [3560. 68-3561. 68] So, there are many benefits. [3561. 68-3563. 68] I just mentioned the present. [3565. 68-3568. 68] The current dollar parts remain at 400 million. [3568. 68-3570. 68] After all, the uncollected currency is so low.

[3570. 68-3572. 68] to 32.78. [3572. 68-3575. 68] Even here there is a risk of sharing. [3575. 68-3579. 68] The 0. 8% of the 0. 8% of the money income. [3579. 68-3582. 68] Of course, it is less than four-fifths and five-fifths of the time. [3582. 68-3584. 68] So the two-sided faction. [3584. 68-3586. 68] But still the risk of sharing.

[3590. 68-3594. 68] The answer is that power is not a 40%. [3594. 68-3596. 68] or four. [3596. 68-3599. 68] The capacitance layer is several layers. [3599. 68-3601. 68] There will be four power shows. [3601. 68-3604. 68] Then one to four. [3604. 68-3606. 68] For example, the capacitance layer.

[3610. 68-3617. 68] Okay, the next question is how much capital expenditure this year is. [3617. 68-3618. 68] There is no accounting for it. [3618. 68-3621. 68] The sale is normally around 26 million. [3621 68-3623. 68] Normal maintenance. [3623]
