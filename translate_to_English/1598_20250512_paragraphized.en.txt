<think> Ok, now I need to process the scripts provided by the user and sort them into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, only the punctuation of the punctuation, line breaks and paragraphs, keeping the original sequence and meaning.

First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a company presentation involving a company overview, product line, financial data, sales mix, and regional distribution. Next, I need to merge the sequentially separated content into a natural segment, each segment with 3-6 sentences, with the theme switching timeout. It is important to note that the order of the original sentence cannot be changed or added or deleted.

I am an IR teacher of Daiyu International, and then I am a small jade, thank you for the introduction of Ms. Mi, and then we introduce the company. These sentences can be combined into a paragraph, introducing speakers and openings. You need to pay attention to the adjustment of the mark, such as "IR teacher," after which you may need to add a period, and "Thank you for the introduction of Ms. Mi," after adding a period. Next is the company overview section, including the company name, the main business, capital, the main products, etc. need to be organized in a sequence of paragraphs, to ensure that each paragraph does not exceed six sentences. For example, about the product line, aerobic fitness equipment, training equipment, commercial and light commercial equipment, etc., can be combined into a paragraphs, with a comment or a comm.

For example, the “2024 and nearly three years’ profit and loss statement” follows a specific set of financial data, which can be combined into a specific set of financial performance changes. The sales portfolio involves different product categories and the proportion of sales of brands, and the information of each brand and product line needs to be integrated to ensure logical clarity. For example, the distribution of home fitness equipment, commercial fitness equipment, medical accessories, etc., can be discussed in detail in detail in terms of the respective sales situation and growth trends.

At the end of the day, about the direction of future development, such as the market layout of commercial fitness equipment, the promotion of electric vehicles and the expansion of global sales channels, need to integrate these strategic directions into paragraphs to maintain the continuity of information. During the processing process, it is necessary to pay attention to the correct use of punctuation marks, such as the use of colons in the enumerated product, the use of commas or periods between sentences.

In addition, pay attention to the correctness of the terminology and numbers, such as "16.71 billion yuan", "0.88", "0.45 yuan", etc., to ensure that these data are not mis-modified during the merger. At the same time, pay attention to the expression of oralization, such as "that", "that", "that", etc., these need to be retained during finishing, but may need to adjust the punctuation to make it more smoother. Finally, read the paragraph-text after finishing, check whether the user has all the requirements: no delete or rewrite content, correctly use the punctuation, paragraphs rational separation, keep the original order and meaning.

Hello everyone. I am an IR teacher of Daiyu International. I am a small jade, thank you for the introduction of Ms. Mi. We will first introduce the company's situation, and then we will open Q&A again. We are Daiyu International Co., Ltd., we are mainly engaged in the production and sales of fitness equipment. Our current capital is 16.71 billion yuan, the main products have aerobic fitness equipment, as well as relatively weighted training, such as phosphorus and that sandbag.

We are also involved in commercial and light commercial aerobic fitness equipment. This is our current major brand, so our brand is larger than these three. Stove is our current home fitness equipment brand, the main selling brand. It is currently the main selling area of North America mainly, it is focused on relatively high-end fitness equipment. The middle Xperia is a relatively low-end fitness equipment, which is a relatively high CP value.

At the end of the day, Spirits is our brand of commercial fitness equipment. We've always been rather biased, and we're moving towards a light commercial like a project or some community. We've recently been more aggressive in expanding the commercial gym. The main brand of commercial gym now is Spirits' aerobic and decorative equipment.

In addition, in addition to fitness equipment is generally aerobic, there are medical accessories products. In recent years, we have also been actively in the annex medical products to do pondering. In recent years, the proportion of medical care has also been increasing, and we will talk later. The middle of the UFC is fighting brands, namely boxing gloves, or Yalins. The most right of Sicada is our own brand, which is the own brand of electric car.

This is our profit and loss statement for nearly three years in 2024. Mainly, we can see that 2024 has a substantial improvement in operating structure compared to 2023. But in the gross profit margin and the profit margin in 2023, we also have a profit margin since 2024, originally from 0.88 in 2023 to 0.45 in 2024.

This is one of our sales portfolios, which is now divided into products. It is not uncommon to see that we currently have the largest share or mainly home fitness equipment. Commercial speaking is actually a very large growth compared to the previous years, because we have just talked about the recent positive expansion of the commercial market.

In addition, the medical part, you can see that the previous proportion is less than one foot. But in 2024, it was only a positive expansion, so there was the Cappella up, 1. 12%. Although the proportion is still small, but because the gross profit of the nearby medical products is actually much higher than that of household and commercial use.

But 2025 is the year we are shipping in the stock market, which is starting to enlarge. So 25 years should grow a lot, which will be at least twice as much as the 1%. In the sales mix, according to the brand, we are currently the largest or the main sales, accounting for 48%. Speria also has a very large increase in recent years, and now it is 23% because it is mainly commercial fitness equipment.

There are other categories that have been around for about 20% of the time. Some of them may be UFC, or some of them may be out of stock. Speria's ratio is slightly smaller, as in fact, Speria's products are relatively low-end cross-CP fitness equipment. In fact, most of the sales areas in the past will be in China, or the United States.

But in recent years, there may be some changes in the fitness equipment market, so the sales situation of these relatively low-priced products will be less. Mainly because they are subject to this relatively high-end treadmill. In the case of sales in various regions, we have been most of us in the United States, about six to seven percent. In the past 24 years, we have a very large growth in Europe. In Europe, we have also acquired a number of online sales platforms.

In addition to the online sales in the United States, we also have better control over our identity. In recent years, we have also been actively expanding the European market, so we have reached more than 20% of our share in Europe. I think that this is a very good progress, otherwise we actually sold in the United States is a bit too single area.

The three have always been the direction of our company's aggressive development. Business is just talking about the Spirit brand, we are now the focus of this brand to promote some European and American areas, small electric lock gym. That is our CT1000 series of products, and we have won the Taiwan Excellence Award for reference.

We will also continue to launch.

Our electric vehicles have new products of our own brand. I finally added some new products of our own. And now we are more likely to pay more attention to the tariffs of the United States than our response strategy. At present, it is because the United States is a policy of equal tariffs, then our company practice is: we originally had a payload in China, then we had to move most of our production back to Taiwan, then we would have to import American products directly from Taiwan's factories.

The price of the products sold by the brand is about 10 to 20%, is a product, is a different thing, which has been in the March April time has been changed the price of the product, the terminal price is also synchronized, but not every item is the same, is to see our products and the client what he saw the situation. Then again, because now the United States with many of these devices, they will ask Chinese manufacturers, but now China is facing a relatively high tariff problem, so we will have to hear some of the effect, such as Amazon they call us to throw out some needs, is to buy us some cheap electric run, it is good news to us, is to say that the tariff problem is very stressful, but we also have some other things besides the strategies we are in response to, we can get some kind of conversion, and then look at the problem.

The range and sort of gross profit margins of domestic commercial medical accessories and other five types of products, the current gross profit margin will be the main medical accessories, and then the commercial is the home. The outdoor furniture was originally produced in China's factory, but because in recent years, the outdoor furniture market is very poor, so we can see that it has a lot of genes, our 24 years of revenue compared to the 23 years of recession is a large part of the outdoor furniture revenue, but in fact, we may not be bad for us, because in fact, the gross profit of outdoor furniture has always been the lowest among our products. Then ask the 2025 revenue, this year's main growth momentum is just talk about the commercial fitness equipment and bicycle belt assembly business, then we can share with you about our revenue in the first quarter of this year is more than the year, so we can be calculated with such scale, it is about the whole year if it is directly multiplied by the concept by 4, it will be more than that part of the last year of our business of the year.

As I have just talked about the information I received from the chairman of our company, it sounds like this is the benefit of the transaction, but may still be in the discussion stage, so it may not be clear how much he size is. Is the situation of the citizen company eBike with the plan is a free brand? Is the free brand's words is to continue to do some ad placement and website optimization, then we have to participate in a lot of exhibitions in the image of our own bicycle brand, is to increase his exposure, but the self-owned brand's distribution time is really a bit slower. But on behalf of shareholders may be able to explain to you, in fact, we eBike's shareholder business this year is all the way to buy orders, so the situation is we can make a few of these things, so now it looks like this year for shareholders to see the market situation.

This year, the first quarter of 2025 is a profit, but the whole year is not over, because in fact, it is not enough to lose money in the assembly business, because it is like a foundry he is a foundry business, basically nothing is a fixed fee, it may not be as high as a free brand, but it is a very stable business. So we have this fixed fee, so we have this fixed fee, so we have this fixed fee.

If you want to increase the value of the exchange rate for the loss of the exchange rate, the second quarter should face a lot of exchange losses, it is not right, but I think that all of us have to trade with the United States dollar, the situation should be the same, because the exchange rate is really a part of our own, the exchange rate can only see how should be said, because if you do our own business, the exchange rate will only see what should be said, because you will definitely believe that we have to do some avoidance strategy, but only at the exchange rate above there will be some exchange rate losses. Revenue and cost in the United States, our revenue is about 6 to 7 percent from the United States, so most of our revenue is in the United States dollar, but we are in Taiwan dollar. What is the proportion of the whole revenue free brand and foundry, now if we refer to all of them is that of fitness equipment, in fact, most of us are basically free brand, now we are only a bicycle to make more belts, fitness equipment is now very little to do with the workers, should be more than 80% of them should be free brand, if only to talk about bicycles, now basically 90% are bicycles, are all belts.

If you want to buy a new car, it is better to buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, it is better to buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, it is better to buy a new one. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. I'd like to ask you how much the gross profit margin is, because I think Taiwan seems to be more than the manufacturer is doing this part, I'm looking at gross profit margin is actually relatively biased, compared to you now the average gross profit margin is very low, I'd like to ask you about this part of your current idea, the gross profit margin of the electrocorrosive car belt assembly is about 30%, you say that there is a 30% gross profit margin, because we're high-end.

Our products are high-end. So our gross profit margins can be around 30%. But we are lower than the ones we have. Because we are only 35 to 40 households. I'd like to ask. Because I see some things like Dafang, or some of them as they may be 10 to 20% of gross profit.

So what do you mean by 30%? That's what you just mentioned in your high-level definition. That's the end price of 10 million dollars? Oh yeah, that's OK. So now or see what they're talking about.

But we're pretty sure we're going to get 30% off. Because we should actually say we're the same as we used to be. That's why we're going to do the same thing as we used to be.

This is because the high-end product is OK, so the profit is probably the number of people in the current scale, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

I wish you all the best on your investment.
