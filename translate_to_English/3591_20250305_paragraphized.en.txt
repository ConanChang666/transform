If you are looking for a company that has a large number of products to offer, you may want to consider buying a new one. If you are looking to buy a new one, you may want to buy a new one.

If you are looking for a new one, you can buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you can buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you can buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one.

This is because the original part of the original is actually because of the past or is already a thing, so we are now in this package home, the original part of the current we call the original of the original of the lighting is actually doing very little, because mainly because this is the first part of the mainland of the original packaging manufacturer is very much, and now the technical threshold of the lighting package is not very high, so the company in these two years we have gradually changed it to this original package of the original packaging capacity, we have been to this part of the original of the car, of course, the first part of the original of the first part of the first part of the car, or mainly in the mainland of the car, because although it really needs certification, but relative to the mainland China market, because they are either the automobile or their entire car market, they are relatively much faster than the U.U. This is the most important part of the year 2024, this part of the revenue of the YY is about 25.58 million in the year 2004, compared to the US dollar here is a relatively depreciating concept, so this piece in Q4 and Q3 it is actually the difference is relatively large, because Q3 at the time of the dollar here is a collective concept, so Q3 in fact, it is a conversion loss, so the Q4 is a conversion benefit, so the difference between the two will reach about 2500 million, so the overall in Q4, once and again will be about once again, the difference will reach more than 2500 million, the overall in Q4, the net profit is about 56.34 million, then the tax after the net profit is 4516 million, the basic earnings per share is about 0.227. If this year 2024, the total annual annual annual annual, the amount of the YY is increased in revenue of the amount of the revenue of the same year 25.58 billion, that year, the year, that year, the amount of this year 2023, that is about about the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the total of this year, the total of this product, the amount of this product is about about 2, the same as the same as the same as the same as the amount of this year, it is about 2, it is about 23.5 billion. In fact, the car product in terms of its goal, the whole of 24 and 23 years of the biggest difference is that we began to ship this so-called finished part of the line 24 years because we had this relatively stable to ship this so-called finished part, the finished line began to be built in the 23 year Q4 here, so it is less visible in 2023, that 2024 because the finished line is relatively stable in the shipment, that this thing with its gross rate, it is actually a lot of correlation with its price, because in the past we started shipping in the past, it we saw it ourselves, about 10 points to 12 points, but in the second half of last year, it is relatively stable in the second half of 20 points of the shipment, it can be maintained up between 15 to 17 points, and about 2023 in Q4, it has been able to reach about 20 points, I said that this line of the finished in the finished product line, because we are in the automotive production line, because now we are built in the automotive production line is a comprehensive production base, so that it is this line.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. So it is relatively stable when its revenue is relatively stable. When the processing rate increases, its gross profit margin will generally increase on average. Relatively, it is relatively stable. The operating cost for the whole 2024 is about 4.89 billion.

The increase in this part should be more or more from the business or in this part of the development of the business. The business, because the entire 2024 company here, in order to expand the business, whether it is in the exhibition or this business trip, etc., is actually more than 23 years.

This is because in 24 years the total number of words is 2402 million, that is about 6.4 million in 23 years. So this part of the approximate amount of differences will reach 1762 million. So the total number of years before this 24 year tax, the tax was set up at 1.74 billion. Then the tax after that is 1.52 billion. So if the owner of the parent company is at 1.4, that is nearly 42 billion.

In fact, if this is the tax after the government's economy of 1.400 million, then it is probably the highest number of companies in the Republic of China after 101 years. Because of this, of course, this is until 2024, I think the whole industry change is very large. In fact, the middle of this experience is the company from the past, from this high power package here high-power packaging, that has been going to be because of the rapid rise of the entire packaging capacity in the mainland of this period.

However, after 2014 and 15 years, the pace of the expansion of the mainland is beyond imagination. So the whole package, especially in the middle and low power side of the price of a huge collapse. That is, of course, the company experienced about the 2017 and 18 years, we actually have some capacity. That is, of course, this includes what we thought at the time, and of course, that is what we thought at the time.

That's why at that time, about 18 years ago, we actually made a reference to some of the equipment that had been packaged for a long time, and some of the asset loss. So there was a significant loss at that time in 2018. I think that if you look at the information of our earnings in the past, it should be something to see. That's what we're seeing as the whole group's development in the car should be traced back to the time of 2014.

It is also said that there is a joint venture development. So we started a production line for this vehicle. The production line is from this subsidiary of Atelier Optoelectronics. So the subsidiary of Atelier Optoelectronics was established at the end of 2014. Atelier Optoelectronics was established at that time.

That's what I thought was the idea of this transformation. Well, that doesn't mean that in two years, if the total assets of 2014 were to be around 41.85 billion dollars, then this real estate facility would be the part of a fixed asset. It's about 38.5%.

That's why I want to make a larger share of cash. The original cash is the two parts of the revenue bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill billboard bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill

That's because by lighting, we currently averaged about two months, basically all of the accounts can be recovered. The car you're currently on average will be in about 90 days to 110 days. Of course, this part we're probably going to analyze some of our peers as well. It's also important to look at its market. If today is more of a market outside of North America, it's basically a normal three-month period. If today's market is in China, we'll see this kind of collection time between 120 days to 150 days.

So, in the current part of our operations, we are probably more concerned about this, that is, in addition to the increase of the number of customers in the entire market, the part of the refund of the payment is also a focus of our operation. That is, in fact, the amount of inventory for the whole two years compared to the actual amount is actually reduced. That is because this part of the inventory is also a large part of the force we have been in the management.

We're going to do this. That said, if this customer didn't do this today, it would be a bit less aggressive in basically our stock. I think this part is not just us, but in fact, we're seeing a lot of these places where manufacturers probably have a concept like that.

I think the difference between these two comparisons is mainly due to the fact that in the year 2024, when we issued a CB, it was the company's fourth-quarter corporate bond. After the issuance of the corporate bond, we have all paid off this long and short-term loan in our account. So we don't see the long and short-term borrowing in the report at the end of the year. That's all in the corporate debt part.

Well, by the end of 24 years, our entire share capital was maintained at 14.36 million like it was 23 years ago. That's where our shareholders' equity is about 31.83 billion. 31.83 billion. Well, I think that's what we're looking forward to this year, and I think the development of the company's group will continue to be whether it's in lighting LED lighting or in the car soon.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to sort out the provided verbatim fragments into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I want to read the user's rules carefully to ensure that they are not deleted, not rewritten, and not condensed. The user specifically emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check the verbatim texts to ensure that there are no omissions. Next, I need to analyze the content of verbatim texts provided. This looks like a description of the company's market layout, lighting, and automotive products.

Each part has a timestamp and corresponding sentence, and I need to group these sentences logically to form a coherent paragraph. First, I will read all the sentences and understand the overall structure. For example, at the beginning, I mention market layout and new customer development, then discuss lighting business with ESG issues, then turn to the shipping situation and production line expansion of automotive products.

For example, the lighting business and automotive products can be separated, and each part of the interior can be arranged in chronological order or logical order. At the same time, note that timestamps may correspond to different speakers or topic transitions, but the user does not have specific instructions, so it may not be necessary to consider the effect of timestamps, just according to the content logic section. During the processing process, make sure that each sentence remains in its original place without any modification. For example, the user mentions "I think we are still doing this market layout", and the sentence should be placed at the beginning of the paragraph as an introduction to the market layout.

At the same time, pay attention to the idioms such as "that", "so", etc., these are common in spoken language, but may need to be adjusted appropriately in a written collation, but the user's requirements do not need to be changed, so it must be retained. In addition, the user's example, some sentences have obvious logical connections, such as "that's actually the car below it also has," where "that" may mean the topic continues and needs to remain the position of the original sentence.

For example, about the parts set up by a European subsidiary, from "so this is why we are all in the same place last year" until "at least it won't be all in the same area", it needs to be as a separate paragraph detailing the reason and the expected effect of setting up a subsidiary. After completing the segmentation, read again to ensure that the sentence in each segment is logically coherent, with no grammatical errors, and all the requirements of the user are met.

So I think this is the issue, I think, we also feel that the two years of this issue is that more and more companies or factories are better, they are more and more in demand for this kind of office lighting or industrial lighting LED lighting. The company is currently working on this part of the word is actually, not only to simply sell this product registration concept, in fact, we will be introduced to say that from the start of this customer here to do some energy-saving assessment and design, if today's customers have such a demand, we will definitely go directly to his entire office, not the factory to evaluate what they use to do lighting a design, then a simulation, then will go with the whole construction of such a concept, because we think this will be the customer will be more a concept of a more value.

In the past, there were, of course, some, for example, lighting market in the past, such as lighting, as a matter of fact, because of the wufu relationship, in fact, many of us export to Russia, this shipment in 2024 is completely interrupted, so of course, if the future is finished, I think the future of this part of the business is only large, and there are only a lot of businesses that can be done. In fact, it may be just a light, it is a part of the car, so the current impact is not very big, we look at the past, of course, if today we are from China direct out of the United States, it will certainly have a tariff problem, but at this time, if we are from Taiwan to manufacture, currently out of the United States has no big impact, relatively, we are doing such a layout, in fact, whether it is a light or say this lighting, in fact, we have found a change in the market, in fact, not only this Europe, in fact, including some Europe, such as some parts of the Middle East, etc., they are going on to ask for something to be localized production, so this is the month of December, we also have to set up a subsidiary in the United States, in the future of which we will have a new concept of production.

That's right, the company is here in mainland China. I think there will be no major investment in the future. That is to say, the top is some existing production lines to do some process optimization. The so-called machine equipment a small amount of replacing such a concept.

I would like to say that this year is going to be 2025. In fact, the view of the company here is still optimistic. Even this January may be due to this year's relationship. It may not look like this growth momentum is not much. But I think I should be at least YY after March is a positive concept.

I think this is what we see right now. OK. Well, I think I'll leave more time here for you. It's all about what you've just reported, or a part of what you want to know. That's where you can ask a question.

Ok Ok Ok Ok We went to the board here last year and we had to buy this one. We actually signed a contract and bought it later. But since it is a new building, it is not a complex building.

We bought one of the 12 floors. The size of that floor was about 1440 pieces. At that time, we bought a starting point for this plant. That is because we used to have a factory in Zhongli.

We rarely make this product in Taiwan. I am talking about the lighting part. Most of the finished product is now produced in Dongguan factory and Yangzhou factory. But the future. The finished product of lighting.

We have to have the capacity to produce here in Taiwan. Of course, this is a record. Assuming I want to reduce my capacity quickly here in mainland China today, Taiwan has to be able to make up for it. We have to have such a space.

Because it is the green development. It is also a factory where the company it covers. When we bought it, it was a concept of pre-sale. It is going to be the fastest this year until June of this year. It will be covered. But it is estimated that it is from the cover to get the whole.

This includes some acceptance certificates. It should be around July. So the whole house should fall around July to August. We will do some decorations in the factory after we have handed over the house. It is to transform it into the space we want to produce. So I think this part.

It was officially put into our entire operation. I think it should be such a concept at the beginning of 2026. This is the current situation. Because this plant is currently a pre-sale. So we are currently paying a price paid by the company here.

So, sorry, so we will only pay once until September 788, we will pay for it. We will pay for it basically until the end of the year. We should.

Our internal estimate should be about 30%. The rest of the 7 percent of us should go to the bank long-term loan part.

So if you pay 30%, it's probably. It's probably going to cost about 80 million more. That's because basically this plant actually does it. If you use this depreciation concept, it should take 40 years to talk about this depreciation.

So in fact, we're taking this impact on ourselves. I think it should be the same. Let's assume that we need this space today. We're going to rent this space outside. A rent for this space should be relatively low.

So, after the completion of August this year. That is to wait for the equipment to enter. Then the formal ROM will be until the beginning of the 26th. The formal production. We will assess that it should be around the beginning of 2026. Q1 pair.

So is the mass production. It is the concept of mass production. We should still have some people like what these are. There are some pre-working hours where these devices are in place. Q3 Because we talked about the whole thing in 2024.

Our capital expenditure is one of the group's capital expenditures. In fact, it is much more than 23 years. Because of the whole 2024. The whole capital expenditure.

That was the whole year of 2023. It was about 7 million up and down. In fact, it was about 5 million. Of course, this is the amount of the group. So you have to divide it by 4 words.

There are about a quarter of a million depreciation costs. This is a group. So this is. There are other advanced investment questions to ask. Any questions can be raised at any time.

Lighting and car order comments. If it is to light. Because lighting is the first. Because we are judging visibility. Probably about 1.5 to 2 months. Because it is mainly because we.

We're probably going to have a focus on our clients. Of course, many of our clients are very stable customers. We know we're going to have to place an order, but we don't think it's a big deal yet.

Of course, many customers in the past would be afraid to say this. The price of the product has been falling. They are not willing to go to the next longer order. But because lighting has actually come to the bottom of the comparison, so it's not like it was in the last few years.

And they shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, he is in the midst of the assembly, and he is in the midst of the assembly; and they shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord God.'

If you are looking for a car that can be used for a long time, you may want to buy a car that can be used for a long time. If you are looking for a car that can be used for a long time, you may want to buy a car that can be used for a long time. If you are looking for a car that can be used for a long time, you may want to buy a car that can be used for a long time. If you are looking for a car that can be used for a long time, you may want to buy a car that can be used for a long time. If you are looking for a car that can be used for a long time. If you want to ask us about our car, the amount of shipping that day is very optimistic, because like many companies recently mentioned that this year's market looks or is relatively weak, is the previous days there is a car, M6 major manufacturers legends have news, that is why relative to these factories, that is, these manufacturers, our car's outlook, or so optimistic, I think it should be said that the car is the first, it is a more closed market, so even if we see so many different companies in the market, they are not the same, so even if we actually say that for Alison, we are actually a subsidiary of Aite here, we should say that our machine is relatively low, so even if we grow up, but relatively large share in this market, it is not really large, plus that this North America gives us feedback, they are all kinds of needs, they are persistent.

This is not the case, because we are afraid to say that this will not be because of the tariff problem, will not be the shipment of this finished product, will not be said to be slow, but at the moment it does not seem to be, so it is more obvious is from February March, March will be more obvious than February shipping volume will be more, will be more. That is the price, that is, we are talking about this shipment, that the overall ASP of this year is how it looks, if in light, his price basically, not too much change, now we look at ourselves, in the car, there may be a demand, of course, that the pressure for us to deal with the solution is, the first is, of course, we will ask a pair of artisans here, or say there is no better these, and that is the part of these materials to talk about this, because now we are a lot of this, in this, in line with this, and it is that we will be the fact, because it is not only, because it is that we need to provide a lot of this, because it is that this, because it is a lot of this, because it is a lot of this, because it is not only because it is not only because it is that we want to provide this, because it, because it, because it, because it is a new, because it is a new product.

This is the first time that we have ever heard of the concept of a car market, but in fact, in terms of the gross profit margin of the car market, it will not be more difficult to say that lighting can be pulled to 30% or even 30% of this concept. Can you ask what the gross profit margin range of each product line is like? If we have a lot of our products, then if we use this lighting, because the original amount of lighting is not as much as it used to be. In fact, it should be said that with the company's current acquisition policy, the lighting actually wants at least 25% of this gross profit to us to pick up the order, of course, which is 25% of our policy, but sometimes because of the different market or the amount of it will have some adjustments.

In particular, those who belong to the kind of dark factory, in fact, his profit is good, but this kind of thing is not like the one-time fermentation of the car, he is gradually to push the next step, like some of the Taiwan market, many of them are chain stores, he must be slowly slowly fermented. The car is actually relatively speaking of the original of the car, because now we are going to compare the original of the mainland market that belongs to the mainland market of the car, and we are now more than 15 percent of the original of the mainland market of the car. So if the module of this car should come down to about 20 percent, the finished product, we just followed the advanced report in November last year, and we should probably be around 20 percent of the distribution.

This year is not likely to be a company? This year, because we just released a CP4 lot, in order to present the current, unless there is some kind of thing, there is a CB4, right, right, right. It is a big decision that we want to make this year, but at least not so far, or not, because the neutral factory has not even called the house yet, so I think it should be perfect here this year.

In fact, LED this industry, because it really is a different thing every year, but in fact, because we are watching, we feel that we need to have some new ideas, there are some new things, that new idea is that tradition perhaps LED people think are selling these lamps and lamps products, but with the whole evolution now, and we want this thing to be more intelligent. So many customers when they come into contact with this product, they want not only to buy this lamp with us, they want to have some design, whether it is the whole scene, the scene design, or say that this thing we can be combined with some, whether it is something intelligent things, intelligent control this concept.
