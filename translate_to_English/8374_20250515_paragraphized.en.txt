We can see the Q1 product category in 2025 There are five categories of products in 2024 The Q1 product category added a device and consumable category because of this situation. In one of these four categories is our automatic wages, or industrial traditional or semiconductor equipment materials, as well as our marketing and services, as well as energy management products, there are some changes in this category. If we look at Q1 in 2025, we have a relatively high growth, mainly in 2025, we have a automation salary, and a temperature in the semiconductor market. Then we look at one of our combined assets.

The following is a re-routing paragraph type transcript:. The week-to-week weather is much bigger, so let's take a look at the moving ratio and the moving ratio. In this part of the flow ratio, we keep up with the quarter-to-quarter ratio, and some of that decrease.

The debt ratio is also the reason why we also borrow from banks, so the debt ratio goes down as well. That's what we reported just as we did last year, because we acquired that subsidiary at that time, so we have a need for some money, so we have to borrow from banks. So, if we are compared to the same year last year, we have a debt ratio, and some of these have a liquidity ratio, which may have some increase.

Thank you. I am Chris, General Manager of Lawson, and now I am here to report on the operational development and outlook of Lawson. Since October 2019, we have been selling and selling automated products from simple Lawson fonts. Over the years, through investment and merger, we have expanded to PowerWorks, which has been acquired by das energy, from simple automation now through automation solutions and energy-reduction packaging equipment and semiconductors in several areas.

Through years of adjustment and integration, we can now provide customers with a complete product integration of maneuvering fluid machinery, while also providing mechanical reserve and machine vision system planning project services as well as sensing module and equipment integration. Lawson has also seen strong technical service capabilities in recent years.

We also provide more complete equipment and procedures. Through the cooperation with our customers over the years, we also found that we have to provide a more complete solution for our customers. Therefore, from simple original services to module and subsystem services to our customers. In the equipment category, we can provide predictive and preventive maintenance services.

We provide complete tracking services for carbon inventory and carbon map machines on the product management. Basically, the trend of future development is definitely AI data services and digital creation. Through these components, we can assist customers in intelligent manufacturing to provide digital empowerment while also providing customers with complete green manufacturing services through energy management and carbon reduction.

This is the system and module that all Rohson customers need in their factory. As soon as it is simple to provide, Rohson can now integrate these devices with different levels of software and data analysis, coupled with some software and data analysis to provide a complete module together with Eco-System Partner to provide a complete bundle stack, energy monitoring, and automation intelligent solutions plus software usage and value-added services.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be handled strictly in accordance with the original text.

First, I will check the structure of the original transcript. It looks like most of the content is about the impact of US-China trade tariffs on the company, as well as the subsequent financing or mergers and acquisitions program, followed by the general manager's response section Chris. There is a repeated "please feel free to like..." request, there are some Italian and Spanish snippets, and finally about smart applications and company strategies. Next, I need to group these contents by logic to form paragraphs. For example, the first part of the impact of US-China trade tariffs can be combined into a paragraph, followed by the general manager's answer, then the duplicated request part, and finally the content of smart applications and company strategies.

Also, the duplicate "please feel free to like..." also needs to be reserved all and cannot be deleted. During the processing process, I will make sure that each timestamp corresponds to the corresponding sentence in order and keep the original timestamp format. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all contents are properly converted. For example, the last part of the content about smart applications and company strategy needs to be separated from the previous financial part, forming separate paragraphs.

The U.S. trade tariffs have an impact on the company's subsequent financing or mergers and acquisitions program. Well, that's thanks to the advanced investment questions. I think about the recent trade war between China and China, both tariffs and exchange rates, all of the industry is very concerned.

I would like to start in April, probably the Taiwan industry for the exchange rate, the impact of tariffs on the profit of the future company operation, this is the most concern for everyone. I first focus on the impact of tariffs on Lawson's current impact, tariffs on Lawson's current, I divided it into two pieces: the first is Lawson's customers, the second is Lawson's subsidiary, Yi Jing.

This is the first Lawson customer, the second for Lawson's subsidiary, Yi Jing, the exchange rate for our subsidiary, with the increase in the value of the exchange rate Taiwan dollar, will have some impact on our revenue. But the whole team began last quarter last year, we made a significant improvement on the overall gross profit rate, especially in the material cost of the whole team, this improvement in the Q2 this year has generated a certain effect on the impact of the exchange rate and the impact on gross profit rate, this should be the opportunity for us to maintain a basic level of gross profit rate. So it seems that the exchange rate for gross profit rate should be limited, but we should continue to observe the impact of the whole exchange rate, and of course, this will have a degree of impact on our gross profit rate.

So around this Lawson area, this three areas, it is a strategy that we will develop in the long run. So from last year to this year, we have such a transformation, I think you have seen the investment in advance of us clearly out of a financial growth of a report, a scale of finance. I think our team will continue to shine on this three areas.

I hope that you are very welcome to invest in advanced friends who can come to our entire Gada Group and Rossen intelligent manufacturing area from May 20th to 23rd. Thank you for your inquiry, I would like to continue to invest in Rossen's professional spirit, we create the best end-to-end effect for our own colleagues. Thank you, Mr. Rossen, for your participation in today's legal meeting, we will upload today's audio and video files, and thank you for your participation in Rossen's 2015 1st Annual Legal Conference, you can now offline, thank you.
