Welcome to ask questions after the briefing session, please turn off the phone or switch the phone to silent mode, thank you for your reference. The briefing session of Cathay Construction Corporation is officially started. First, we will introduce you to the operation team today: Deputy General Manager of Spokesperson Lin Ching-liang, Hello, and Deputy Spokesperson Liao Li-yi. Today's briefing will be provided by the Deputy Spokesperson Liao Li-yi to brief you on the company's operational performance and strategy, and then the Spokesperson and Spokesperson will reply to the relevant questions together.

We have been focusing on the real estate development for over 60 years, and since 2011, we have expanded to our own upstream and downstream, as well as our own downstream and downstream, as well as our own investment and business development.

As we can see, from 2020, we started working with Japan's large real estate development company, Mitsui Real Estate, and we have a joint venture to set up some residential development projects. In 2018, we also worked with Mitsui Real Estate to have a cooperative hotel in northern Taiwan, which is expected to open in the second quarter of 2027. The hotel in northern Taiwan is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the mall is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 20 March.

The total revenue of 2024 was 238. 6%, the most important of which was our parent company, Cathay Construction. The profit of the entire parent company, the net profit of the company, the net profit of the company, the net profit of the company is 15.8 billion, and the EPS is 1.3.6 billion. The completion of 2024 is, of course, some judges will say why the completed revenue is 23.6 billion, but in fact, the gross profit we pay is probably still in the same period, the most important thing is that the company's job site actually has sand basins to double the original wage, so your gross profit is lower than last year.

This is the next page, we have assets that are not listed in the table, the total assets is about 834.100 million, the total assets are about 495.100 million, the total assets are about 55%, so we are quite focused on the industry. The site we completed is about 2.7 billion, and the site we finished in 2024 and the absorption of gold and MOSCAS. This part is because we have some of the assets we have not yet handed over at the end of the year, and most of them will be imported in the first quarter of this year. In the first quarter of our investment in real estate, the current price is 120.900 million, the part of which does not contain half of our electricity usage is about 9.900 million, and the total market value is about 260 million, so the potential value is about 125 million.

That said, the whole project should be around 260 billion. There are four construction sites to be completed this year, including the park, the Uni Park, and the Cathay United River.

The following is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs:. As for the second season, it should be the second season. That is, the second season should be the second season. It should be the second season. It should be the second season. It will come in.

We expect the whole 2024 to 2029. The entire construction site is completed. The sales of the entire project is really good. But our future revenue visibility is good. So we have a reserve for the project in the north and south-east. The current reserves are expected to be about 50 billion.

Let's take a look at the next page. That's from the part line. We can see. Our total of 4 cases in 2025 are estimated to be about 156 billion. In 2026, total of 5 cases in 16.29 billion. In 2027, 6 cases in 29 billion.

In 2028, there were 3 118 billion cases. Then in 2029, there were 2 325 million cases. The whole revenue schedule has been up to 2029. Here, we need to supplement the entire year of completion to the present.

Because engineering is the work of the hand, so there is the impact of KPO, etc. So the progress of the work, etc. There are also the number of customers to enter, etc. can all affect the beauty of our entry. But the impact should be a little bit of the time.

The whole part of the investment. I no longer have to elaborate on this. That is to give everyone a reference to themselves. Then we look at the industrial landscape at the end. First of all, we can see the entire factors that affect the changes in the industrial market. Including economic factors.

In 2025, Taiwan's GDP was 4.2%. The chart on the right is the Taiwan is the science and technology island. Therefore, the total export statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In December 2024, the amount of human electronic products exports reached 199.2 billion. The annual growth rate reached 33.5%.

The global AI is driven by the bribery of the whole world. The domestic semiconductor and communications industry expects this year to be the cornerstone of our export performance. The capital expenditure is subject to a high interest rate environment.

That's exactly what Trump is saying every day. That's what everyone expects from the Taiwan stock market to fall. Around April 2, Trump's entire tariff policy is very high. It's pretty uncertain now, so the stock market's performance is all back-to-back. That's why it can also drive our impressions.

The economic performance of our country is great. So overall, we expect the domestic climate to be warm inside and outside. The next page is also about the government policy. From this picture, we can see that our data is from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024. The basis period of the entire index is 2021. That is based on our Cathay Index sales rate index.

In addition to New Taipei City, Taiwan, 7 of the other 6 have already reached the peak sales rate since the second quarter of last year. The performance of the first half of the year is pretty good. The main benefit is that the Sun Jinan preferential loan and the return of foreign funds. This also helps to reach 30 billion. But the fourth quarter has been long and long, and the central bank has sent the seventh wave of credit control.

So overall, the real estate policy is to continue to guide the entire market toward first-buying. It develops smoothly in the direction of continued rigid demand. The next page has all the aspects of our pre-sale market. Finally, we can see from this Cathay real estate index.

That's why there will be some year-on-year declines in the course of course. But the biggest bump in the world is that the prices and materials are soaring in the future. Because the world actually prints so much money. That's what drives the industry's growth. The volume index can be seen from the volume index. 2021 was the second quarter after the market price rose.

However, since the second quarter of last year, the volume index has declined. However, the price is still high. Therefore, the fourth quarter of the year we have seen a steady decline in price. So overall, the number of turnovers in the entire 2024. There is still a new high in the past 11 years. The outlook for the whole country is benefiting from the continuous development of the global AI industry.

Although you may think that AI is a booming situation. But in fact, the booming of resistance is actually a lot more than the current P. That is, because we are still relatively local in domestic real estate. We do not have any situation within the short term of central bank regulation.

Thank you again for coming to our company's meeting this afternoon. After a shocking education with more than 900 points in the morning, I also think it's a good thing to hear a little good news in the afternoon. It was a five-time decision from the last visit to our company. It was a five-time decision from the last visit to our company. It was a 50-and-a-half visit last November.

At that time, I mentioned a few things in the supplemental explanation. There were about three points. The first was the central bank's seventh wave of credit control, which was 919. At that time we expected that the wave of control was quite strong. It must have been able to guide the whole house to the basic normal development.

That's what I see from now on. It's actually done. So there's no such thing as the eighth wave of the property itself. The second point mentioned is that although the whole property species of the house are observed. But basically living alone is called a rebar demand.

It will continue to grow. That was the last time I mentioned was the population of Taiwan. In fact, it was all the way down. This means that the demand was always there.

The data I have on my hand is 2.54. Each household has 2.54. Last year it was down to 2.47. It is actually the latest and down to 2.44. So from this data, we can see that the household population has been declining. Most of the time, it is the need of its residential home.

This is the second point mentioned earlier. That third point is obvious. The worst thing to deal with is the spring 2.00. At that time we also expected it to raise so-called peer doubts. I think this is all clear. This is what is happening now.

Of course, a lot of things are on both sides. The general rule is the other side of Zhang. In fact, it also triggers the need for some asset guarantees. I think this can be kept secret in the market. In fact, it is two-sided. In fact, it is not completely bad.

It is, in fact, another aspect. That is the focus of this year's outlook that I proposed last year. At the end, we made a conclusion. It was probably a re-optimization. We wanted to get you there urgently.

Our company's actual push. Last year, we were in September 19th because of the 7th wave of control. The next few days we were in September 21st. Taichung push. A forest push in Xiqi push. Then you can imagine that it was just introduced in September 19th.

That will take us away in a few days. I think we're going to face a lot of challenges. We'll actually see how our company performs.

This is the case. The forest will talk about the case in the present case. It was introduced in the ninth inning. The current sales rate is about 84%. This is the actual number.

We do not have any tags for A Year in the Life of a Woman [Stereo] lyrics. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Now it's about two months away. It's about 62 67. So the total price is over 4000 pieces. So you just listen to this basic condition.

In fact, we now have two months. The current rate of sales. I just showed in the data. It's about 40%. So from this we actually push a situation.

It's not what you see, or what you see in the newspaper. It's like a state of pessimism. In fact, except for our company. There are actually other cases. There are some cases.

This year, the company will follow up on Q2 Q3. There will be another case. That combined us this year. From the beginning to the end, there will be about 2.6 billion. So let's summarize the species I just came up with.

See the present from last year. For the development of the division of our company. You can see the fact. There are probably two sentences summarized. The first one is the company. The company is actually found.

The market trend is pulsating. So last year, the public sector. Issued cases. Basically, it was launched in the first half of the year. The business meeting was launched in the second half of the year.

This is the first of its kind, and the second of its kind, and the last of its kind, or the first of its kind.

But the truth is, even if it is in the business, we can still listen to the brand's reputation. I want to start this year's project from just Hu Sun.

With the Q2E push last year. The performance is likely to see this. That combined with the observation of the information we just provided.

In fact, the sales rate is about half the truth, that's what Thailand does, and that's what Thailand does in the next few years.

That's why I think, although this morning, that kind of shocking education, but basically, you can still give the company, full of confidence.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The other three are the UMI of the pub. There is also a Cathay American box. The three are probably in what season. And the second is.

I found it. Because there was an excellent mention of the last throne. So that was determined by delay by 2026. That is 26Q will you come in. And then there is the third question to ask. Company.

Because it's actually a company. You're all debating. You're the one who launched the direct sale. It's relatively possible gross interest rate. It may be comparable. It's just that it's harder to reflect the public price doubles last year.

Then, for example, this year's case, we're going to show this situation, or in fact, we're going to sell it next year's case, if there's a change in these cases, it's reflected in the public price double.

So gross interest rate is the opportunity to go back to the past number. You can go up again. Yes. Because you are now the time of the case. That is the question. The part of Cathay Yoyang.

We just talked about it. Before the second quarter of this year. The part of Cathay PAC was in May. The part of the United States was in September. The part of force PAC was in October. This was probably the progress of our planning.

The best part is, the best part is next year, because the main thing is, the original supply is not a problem, because at the end of the time.

There is only one part of the drain. The municipality asks us to do it. We want to restore it. So that part affects. The part we were about to complete this year. That is what we want to do.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged in chronological order into paragraphs.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to confirm each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. In the fragments given by the user, each entry has a time range and corresponding sentence. For example, [1477. 76-1478. 76] The second word is us one. The next is other timestamps and sentences. My task is to combine these sentences arranged in chronological order into consecutive paragraphs while keeping the order and content of the original sentence intact. Next, I need to determine how to segment them.

For example, if a sentence is continuous on a timestamp, but the content belongs to the same topic, it may need to be merged into the same paragraph. At the same time, it is important to note that the sequence of timestamps is correct to ensure that there is no confusion.

For example, the first few sentences are about the relationship between the stock market and the housing market, then the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic, then the discussion of the cost and operating conditions, and finally the impact of self-building and construction. These sections may need to be divided into different paragraphs, each of which begins around a topic. During the processing process, there may be some duplicate or similar sentences, such as "of course it has a correlation but it does not have a positive correlation" appear twice, to confirm whether they are all in the original manuscript and retain them.

In addition, some sentences may be grammatically or structurally incomplete, but they cannot be modified according to the user's request, and can only remain as they are. After completing the initial paragraph division, I will read the entire converted text, check if all the sentences are correctly contained, without missing or duplicated, and the transition between paragraphs is natural. At the same time, make sure that the sequence of timestamps is correct, without any confusion.

The second word is that we are one. Payroll Ratio doesn't know what level it is. Thank you. In fact, the stock market and the housing market.

You say it's all right. It's not necessarily true. Even if you say the house is in the middle of the economy, it's not really relevant. Of course it's related.

But there is a correlation, of course, there is a correlation, of course, there is a correlation, but there is no correlation. It is not necessarily, for example, you do not know the economy. It is like you do not know the economy.

Financial tsunami. After the financial tsunami, the global economy is not really so good. But you pay attention to the price at that time. Slowly began to rise a wave. That city.

In fact, it is with the water level of the funds. Its correlation is higher. So the United States actually after 2008. There is QE. That is, of course, later. You want to shrink the table.

It may be with the level of funds. Everyone can. It must be clear. So in fact, the level of funds required is still high. That is, in addition to the level of funds, and then.

Of course, time is closer to OB9. That's 2020, 2021. That's the fact of 2020, 2021. For example, after COVID-19. In fact, the economy isn't that ideal. But the price has increased again.

That began in 2021 because of the COVID-19 relationship. The supply was also rising. The price was even more. The bottom line is closer, so you say the local problem.

"I do not think that this is the case," he said, "and I do not think that this is the case.

In particular, we see that money is one thing. The other is the cost. In fact, the cost is now. The cost of the land or the operating costs. In fact, we look at it.

There is no such thing as a downward trend. That's right, I know it's real, but it's a bit of a surprise.

This is not the way to do it. This is the way to do it. This is the way to do it. This is the way to do it. This is the way to do it. This is the way to do it.

Then, we will be rewarded with good things, and we will be rewarded with good things, and we will be rewarded with good things, and we will be rewarded with good things, and we will be rewarded with good things, and we will be rewarded with good things.

This is not the truth, it is the truth, it is the truth, it is the truth, it is the truth, it is the truth.

I'm just saying that, in this case, in this case, the system needs, if there is a system demand, there is a system resistance demand, in fact, it can be, for example, recently.

This is one of the best-selling books of all time, and the best-selling book of all time is the best-selling book of all time.

In fact, it is about 100. My impression should be from 103, 104. The time began slowly. The number of products is getting smaller and smaller. Until recently. Because the unit price is rising very quickly.

So this number is possible. Everyone is more sensitive. I think that is basically. The total market if there is that demand. I just said it. It's the system needs as well.

Or their own needs. Or so-called preservation. If there is a case of rain or rain, I think it will still exist in the market. If it is more difficult to operate, then it is a case stream.

The company's brand. I think it will be more prominent at this time, so it is also based on this factor, so it is based on this factor, so I just finished.

The word of God is the word of God, the word of God, and the word of God is the word of God, and the word of God is the word of God, the word of God, and the word of God is the word of God.

Special considerations. That is also the final approval of the board of directors for P&O maintenance. That is why it is only after the approval of the board of directors for our business. But we should. Because some builders already have some announcements. I think we should not have those special considerations.

All I can say is that there are a few builders, so it's like making a lot of money.

And it shall come to pass, when he shall say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to one of the least of these, but to the least of these, ye did it not to me.

There is almost always hope for green light. We basically don't have anything else. Some builders have already announced something strange. These special considerations seem to be no at the moment. But we still have to go through the final decision of the board of directors.

This is how I will show you how to do it, and how to do it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it, and what to do with it.

It's a little bit lighter than floating. It's actually a mammal. In fact, it's a relationship with time. It's a whole development time.

Maori will be expected to be a little higher. That's the short development time. Maori will be relatively low. I think the company's definition of Maori is. This has a discount. I would like to ask.
