<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will read the entire transcript to understand the structure and theme of the content. It looks like this is a record of the explanatory meeting, involving company introduction, market analysis, financial data, etc. Next, I need to reorganize the original timestamped sentences into a coherent paragraph, while maintaining the order and content of each sentence.

In addition, the user mentions a phrase-by-word phrase that may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence or phrase that needs to be combined into a naturally smooth paragraph. For example, for the part of the plant distribution, there are several timestamps that describe different regions of the plant, and they need to be combined into a coherent paragraph, while retaining all the details. It is also important to pay attention to duplicated content, such as [57. 56-57. 60] and [57. 60-57. 62], which repeats "the whole next month will be sealed" after the conversion, and need to ensure that these duplicates remain after the conversion, as the user requests do not delete anything.

After completing the initial draft, read it again to confirm that all the timestamps corresponding sentences have been properly integrated, no missing or error. </think> The following is a re-arrangeable paragraph-by-text text according to the principle of "not deleting any sentences, not summarizing" provided by you: --- All investors are welcome to invest in advanced afternoons.

Hello everyone, I would like to share with you a personal statement from the company in the first quarter of 2025. Next, we have a factory in Yilan, Taiwan, three factories in Taipei, and a factory in Nantong, China. The red copper store in Thailand is actively in the construction of the factory, and it will be capped next month.

In 2024, some of the entire HDI accounted for the highest proportion, accounting for 49%, the other part of the soft and hard composite board accounted for 32%, the traditional version accounted for 10%, and the high frequency products accounted for 7%. From the product point of view, the whole car has 37%, IT products have 28%, IoT products have 60%, the whole Smart Device has 2%, and the other parts have 27%, of which nearly 20% are the products with the lowest satellite growth last year.

This part is for reference only. This part is a portion of 2023 and a portion of 2024. So it looks like the whole part of the car has not declined in the last year, but the proportion is down, because the whole of the 2023 42%, down to 37% in 2024. The whole IoT product has been pulled to 28%, the rest of the other part has been pulled from 20% to 27%, mainly in 2023 the low-track satellite products accounted for about half 10%, probably in 2024 has fallen to nearly 20% of the proportion.

The part of the soft and hard partition also increased from 30% to 32%, then NED slightly lower, then HDI increased from 37 to 49, mainly the car, including the low-track products are all HDI design. The transmission board has been slightly lower from 22 to 10%, the high-frequency actually has increased, but its proportion is because revenue compared to the previous year, we have increased by 23 percent, so the whole high-frequency proportion actually decreased from 8% to 7%.

That part of the gross profit of the total gross profit of the entire gross profit of the year is nearly 20%, the whole to the 23rd quarter of last year was more than 20%, the fourth quarter was the gross profit of the total gross profit of the entire gross profit of the year, and the whole gross profit of the total gross profit of the total gross profit of the year was about 19.3 million. We probably have some research studies to look at. The first part seems to be the current generation of AI applications, from the AI service market in 2024, and in the next 10 years it will reach US$352 billion, so we see that the impact of the market is very large, the entire compound growth reached 27.6%. The second part is the need of the whole edge computing will be increased due to the automation of the smart city agriculture and medical industry in the whole world, and the size of the global edge computing will grow from 2023 to 2698 billion, so the compound growth of the 33.3%, which is very much in the future.

Since there are 10,8 million units in 2024, 38% of the potential for the whole future is very large. The global 2024 PC market is 2.65 billion units, and by 2028, it will reach 2.10%, so it may be slightly longer. However, AI PC penetration is the main part of the future, the total amount will not increase much, but because the overall AI function will increase the effect of the PC. The fourth point according to S&P Global Monetary estimates, the growth rate of global automotive market in 2025 has a number of, 1.7% growth, about 90 million units, but the sales of electric vehicles will reach 15 million units, about 30%.

Another part of the study estimates the sales of electric vehicles in 2024 by 17.5 million units, but by 2025 if it continues to grow to 30%, it can reach 2275 million units. So it seems obvious that the whole automotive market has increased, but the fact that the whole market, especially the European market, the whole part of the overall acceleration of electric vehicles is a little slower, even to the concept of oil hybrid vehicles. In addition to the fact that the whole U.S. tariffs, the progress of China's doubts, will take the growth of global sales first, including the back-seat market, but also the whole European car, also a large volume of tariffs, so this part of the overall market of the overall sales of the automotive market will feel relatively limited, especially the whole roll of the mainland, and the supply over the performance is very obvious.

A prediction from the IMF showed that the global economy grew by 3.3% in 2025, a slight drop to 4.2% on average from 3.7% in the past 10 years, and an estimated further drop to 3.5% by 2026. However, as regional conflicts and the protectionist part exacerbated economic pressures, I think it is clear that the U.S....

In addition to the fact that there is a new trend in the supply chain, there is also a slight impact on the status of the purchase, especially the addition of tariffs, which will affect the future of import and export, as well as the consumption of the entire market, the whole Fed's interest rate has been reduced to 4.25 to 4.5 by the end of the year, the entire Fed's interest rate has been reduced to 5.25 to 5. This year, the part of the year, you want to see the pressure of inflation has been reduced, that together there will be several downwards, if there is a way to continue the growth of the whole economy. The third part is the continuous development of the AI application, so AIPC as a terminal application, AI server and AI, is the main driver of the future. This is the most important part of the electric vehicle market, but the main or mainland market, the most proportion of China, but it for the whole car PCB, because the high-power copper plate and IMS metal plate technology research and development, will accelerate further layout of the car battery and battery management system, as well as the LADAR sensing equipment, the whole Adar products is also the place we continue to promote, which is also the hope of the whole traditional car and electric vehicle parts of the application of the so-called sensor sensor, which is the key to our future growth.
