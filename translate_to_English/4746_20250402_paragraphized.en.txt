Hello everyone. Today I am honored to invite you to participate in this forum. First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team of the meeting today. The first is Dr. Chen Zhengyu Chen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Taiwan Pharmacopoeia Co., Ltd. The second is Vice President of the Administrative Support Office.

The fourth is a CDMO business host, Dr. Tsang. Next, Dr. Tsang gave a briefing for us. Dr. Tsang is welcome. Thank you for joining us this afternoon for our first French briefing session this year.

The first one is our 2024 operating condition and the current overall operating status as of 2025 to February. The rest is our operating strategy and some important business explanations. The first part is our operating performance. Here you can see that by 2024, our overall performance was $4731 million compared to 8% growth in 2023.

First of all, we are more concerned about the combination of cholesterol phosphate and phosphate is Polymer products Our annual performance is 163800 million YY is 4%. That Vitamin D said last year at the end of the year, we exported goods so last year, the overall value was 820 million YY is 1%. Another better growth product is the respiratory system drug, you can see that we are 57600 million compared to in 2023, there are 67 million products, so there are 20% growth.

In the case of anti-inflammatory painkillers, YY is 1 percent. The drug used in the central establishment system is 2 billion 67 million YY is 6 percent. The other part is about 8 trillion YY is 40 percent where there is a class of estimated products we have a pretty good growth last year.

In terms of product revenue, you can see that the main three categories are ours or ours with glycemic acid compounds Vitamin D, as well as the commissioning of R&D and foundry and our FUCHISOMO are our top four products. The rest of the products are also quite well occupied. For 2024, our net profit per share is 1.31 net worth per share is 63.9 net worth per share. You can see that last year's gross profit margin was about 42%.

The net profit is due to the impact of some out-of-the-way investments. The evaluation of assets can only be influenced by 3.4%. A large part of the people here should also know that it is from Taikang's stock price. In this table, we want to report to you that our operating expenses in the last 8 quarters are quite controlled.

The final benefit is that there are also some drops in Q4. But the overall maintenance is pretty good. In this business strategy, we all know that Taikang Chemical is starting with the Generic API, which is a well-known API. So we still maintain high-quality production on the name API, then stabilize our raw material supply chain, and then we expand our production efficiency and capacity to meet the needs of our customers.

In the future, there will be two main driving force behind the development of the CDMO, one of our overall products. We can do this from one-stop service, from Drug Substance step to Drug Product. There will be one of our most important development directions in the future is the ADC OEM. This Taiwan Kang Chemical has been producing in Taiwan for more than 10 years, so we should be able to deliver the maximum capacity and output to customers from different parts of the world.

It is also an important direction for us in the future. We all know that chemistry is a combination of its own ingredients, ADC TrueTech and CDMO, as well as a multi-pronged combination that can operate as a transformative investment.

Our wholly owned subsidiary in Chicago was completed in June last year. It is here to provide North American customers with more options to provide CDMO in the United States. There are also early R&D services.

There is also SYNCENMATE. Utilize is a company that invests in medical devices. At present, we are the main production and R&D base for three cities in Taiwan. Japan is part of the Sales of our GENERIC API. We are also the market for developing our CDMO in Japan.

We are here to expand our business, so we currently have plans to expand our production line, which is expected to be completed in 2027. The initial investment is mainly focused on Cultridge's annual production capacity of about 30 million doses. Some of the capabilities of the original recruitment plant are filled with Cultridge, but here is to meet the needs of the future commercialization, so we start investing.

The future Assembly Online is the assembly line of medical devices is also our next step. There is a number here for you to refer to is that GOP1 related products we have been developing. We are also working with our partners in the discussion. If the global market is more familiar with the stage of biochemistry, for example, Prosentix is the market for diabetes, the world is 16.8 US dollars. **Please note: **Please note:**

Below is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: [473. 50-476. 50] GOP1 is the market for weight loss currently has 8.2 billions. [476. 50-479. 50] It is still growing. [481. 50-485. 50] Well, the next part is some of our important business explanations. [485. 50-488. 50] The part of the raw material is just as we have reported to you. [488. 50-490. 50] We are mainly focused on optimizing our yield.

[490. 50-493. 50] Expanding our production capacity and fixing our supply side. [493. 50-495. 50] A direction for our main operations. [495. 50-499. 50] The three more important parts of last year's statement were reported to us. [499. 50-501. 50] Cholesterol phosphate we still maintain the market. [501. 50-505. 50] The market impact is ours. [505. 50-509. 50] Should be the largest market share in this API.

[509. 50-513. 50] The market share of our market is still able to continue to grow. [513. 50-516. 50] The steroid product is said to be in the original supply chain. [519. 50-524. 50] Then they also have a corresponding increase in demand for them. [524. 50-527. 50] So this year will also contribute a considerable amount of revenue. [527. 50-529. 50] This is mainly the part of last year.

[529. 50-531. 50] This year there will still be quite a lot of revenue for the source part. [531. 50-533. 50] From steroid products. [533. 50-538. 50] CDMO part we maintain to provide one-stop service. [538. 50-542. 50] This is the development of the CMC from early development to early development. [542. 50-545. 50] Production of the final land filling and packaging. [545. 50-549. 50] That in the last year, we had a one-stop service for our needs.

[549. 50-555. 50] With our ability to obtain airport certification and production, the demand for one-stop service has also increased considerably. [557. 50-561. 50] The current customers who came to us compared to last year's guests. [561. 50-563.1. 50] We also have a 30% growth. [563. 50-567. 50] is a CDMO for one-stop service from DS to DP. [567. 50-571. 50] It is also a case of CDMO for Europe's US-Japan.

[571. 50-573. 50] It is difficult to continue the supply of doubt. [573. 50-575. 50] The new case is currently on the market. [575. 50-578. 50] It is expected that the project will be confirmed in the second half of the year. [578. 50-581. 50] The other products in these CDMO. [581. 50-585. 50] Two new cases of these customers have begun to develop early services. [585. 50-588. 50] It indicates that we have performed very well on CDMO.

[588. 50-589. 50] Those customers' words. [589. 50-591. 50] are willing to find some new cases to serve. [591. 50-593. 50] continues to negotiate. [593. 50-596. 50] SYNCAN FOMOSA's words are after our acquisition. [596. 50-598. 50] We continue to develop our North American business steadily. [598. 50-602. 50] There are four clinical stages of cases that we have so far.

[602. 50-607. 50] Returned to Taiwan after the development of SYNCAN FOMOSA. [607. 50-611. 50] Another case was also in ongoing negotiations. [611. 50-614. 50] Some of the clinical stages of the case. [614. 50-617. 50] was also gradually entering the phase of production shortage and commercial mass production. [617. 50-61. 50] was the future. [619. 50-623. 50] was gradually preparing for commercial production.

[623. 50-626. 50] The last thing we have to do is start now. [626. 50-628. 50] Gradually we provide our eco-pharmaceutical synthesis services. [628. 50-631. 50] The customer is also slowly knowing that we have these services. [631. 50-633. 50] There are more and more needs as well. [633. 50-640. 50] Here we want to tell you about our CDMO customers' patterns and stages. [640. 50-642.5] Our customers are actually pumpkin.

[642. 50-645. 50] includes API artifacts and ADCs. [645. 50-648. 50] Here you can see that the API is actually uniform to the parent. [648. 50-651. 50] is inclusive of commercials and there are various stages. [651. 50-655. 50] The artifacts are slightly larger in commercial parts. [655. 50-660. 50] The other early capital M8 is also our significant client. [660. 50-665. 50] The ADC part of the ADC is in addition to the earlier M8 and Base1 Base2.

[665. 50-667. 50] We also assist our clients in developing. [667. 50-669. 50] There are also clinical trials available. [669. 50-676. 50] ADC has several more important parts that we would like to report to you as well. [676. 50-678. 50] This is what we did last year. [678. 50-683. 50] Our overall customers are now very quickly included in Europe and Taiwan. [683. 50-686. 50] Some of the more important customers are European customers.

[686. 50-689. 50] He has now entered the experimental phase of the clinical group. [689. 50-691. 50] It has begun to zoom in production. [691. 50-697. 50] This client is mainly focused on the development of new drugs in ADC. [697. 50-700. 50] We have now signed new plans with him. [700. 50-704. 50] Starts to screen for new ADC follow-up drugs. [704. 50-707. 50] The future is also expected to enter clinical trials.

[708. 50-712. 50] Another customer's speech is also a twentieth-century customer. [712. 50-71. 50] We have now provided him with ADC drug to expand the final product. [716. 50-723.1. 50] This Cdm speech is also from PelLinker to Conjugation ADC. [723. 50-72. 50] At the end of the day, we have started to develop and produce marine chemistry here. [727. 50-731. 50] The demand for new enlargement production has started very well. [731. 50-73. 50] We will also start production this year.

[733. 50-737. 50] That is why this case is also very good for customers. [738. 50-743. 50] The other progress is that our customers in Japan Australia and Taiwan are more and more on ADC. [743. 50-746. 50] That is why it is not currently limited to the two original customers. [746. 50-750. 50] Some of the early R&D customers also know that we have these capabilities. [750. 50-754. 50] That we will slowly find our R&D and subsequent production. [754. 50-758. 50]

[758. 50-760. 50] Our expansion plan is also underway. [760. 50-765. 50] The future of ADC is now a hotly developed direction. [764. 50-766. 50] We hope to provide more services here in North Mil. [766. 50-767. 50] The future of ADC is now a hotly developed direction. [767. 50-770. 50] More services are available to our North American customers. [772. 50-774. 50]

[774. 50-780. 50] At present, SUA has already completed this part of Taiwan. [780. 50-785. 50] The FDA's statement has also completed the collection of the site in July last year. [785. 50-791. 50] The EU's inquiry site is currently scheduled to visit the Taiao chemical production site in May of this year. [791. 50-796. 50] The statement here is also an area of our own recruitment product. [797. 50-799. 50] Expected inspection time of the general production line. [799. 50-802. 50] The FDA was also completed in August of last year.

[802. 50-806. 50] This year's Q2 is expected to get GDP Certificate. [806. 50-81. 50] Our machine production line is to provide the production of small molecule crystal kinetic commercial products. [813. 50-81. 50] In addition to providing simple Ichiba services. [817. 50-89. 50] We also cooperate with medical device manufacturers. [819. 50-82. 50] Then it should be a development of complex products. [824. 50-826. 50] This is also a line that we will take in the future.

[827. 50-828. 50] Then we will go in the direction of a line. [828. 50-832. 50] Then we will be able to develop a more diverse business. [832. 50-835. 50] As for the parts of the machine. [835. 50-835. 50] We are more concerned about the Airgreen section. [837. 50-840. 50] Taiwan's Listing is still ongoing. [840. 50-845. 50] We expect to get the first medical center invoice in Taiwan in the first half of this year.

[845. 50-847. 50] That is, after the receipt of this invoice. [847. 50-850. 50] Other hospitals are also able to proceed with the purchase. [850. 50-853. 50] The rest of their Europe have signed contracts. [853. 50-857. 50] Europe has just been reported to be on the Q2 of this year. [857. 50-861. 50] We have arrived at our factory in Taiwan for a collection of live events. [861. 50-866. 50] Some of our U.S. states we are currently having additional questions about the FDA.

[866. 50-867. 50] We have responded. [867. 50-871. 50] We are now waiting for a final response from the FDA. [871. 50-873. 50] We will be waiting for further information. [873. 50-876. 50] Or the time of our final service in Berlin greatly. [876. 50-882. 50] Other markets include the signing of contracts in Singapore, Pakistan, Hong Kong.

[887. 50-889. 50] Except for this EUBIN. [889. 50-892. 50] We have three other categories of products under development. [892. 50-895. 50] includes drugs spelled by Anemia names. [897. 50-897. 50] and GEO P1 products. [897. 50-899. 50] This has just been reported. [899. 50-901. 50] is the expansion of our production line.

[901. 50-903. 50] In response to future needs. [903. 50-907. 50] There is also a development of a product related to chronic kidney disease. [907. 50-911. 50] These developments are ongoing in our planning. [911. 50-916. 50] It is also in negotiations with our potential partners. [917. 50-91. 50] Until further news. [919. 50-921. 50] I will report to you.
