Here is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph type: Well, you are welcome to invest in advance to attend today's conference on Prospective Technology. The presenter is our General Manager in San Francisco. We will give this to the General Manager in the next time. Thank you, all of you.

I'm so glad you came to a meeting with expectations. I saw a lot of people who were following us. That's what I'm thankful for. I've been here for the first quarter of this year, so I've compiled some data on the first quarter of the market.

After the report, we all had a problem. Welcome to come and talk about it. At present, our capital is about 58 billion. The current monthly capacity is about 54 million pieces a month. The three factories are building a new headquarters in Zhunan. All works are on schedule.

So the whole building is expected to be completed next year. The three factories are building a new headquarters in Zhunan. Let's take a look at our Q1 financial figure. We are in 2021 to 2024. In fact, we have an annual revenue growth rate of about 28%.

The first quarter of that year was $8.100 million. It was about 6% more than the same period last year YY. It was about 48 in Maori. It was 39 in the past year. It was 41% in the first quarter of this year.

The operating profit margin was 30 last year. That was 29% this year. That was the net profit part. The first quarter of this year was 25%. So, from the whole revenue growth.

That net profit margin from gross profit margin. Nawangquan has always had a good performance. That's part of the earnings EPS. From 2021 to 2024. We have a rich growth rate of 40. That's why in 2021 we have about 4.6 pieces.

That last year was 11.8. That first quarter of the year was 3.32 pieces. That was actually the first quarter of the year compared to the same period last year. The money earned was more. But because we have a dilution of equity in our share capital listing. So EPS is slightly less than the same period last year.

Last year was about 3.4. That's when the return on equity was about 25% in 2024. That's because there was a value added when listing. That's why the ROE in the first quarter of this year was a little lower. ROE is currently about 20%.

The ROE of 20 is also a good financial number. That's to look at one of our revenues in the first quarter. A situation in the entire market. In the first quarter, the Japanese market accounted for 54% of our revenue.

That can be seen in 2024. Our Japanese market YoY is 28%. That 2025 Q1 YoY is 37%. That is, it is the first quarter of this year. Japan has a very large growth rate. It is mainly from Japan.

Here there is one more new direction. A new product is a market. It is mainly our second-generation green blue light product. It is also a product of flash film. It is on the market. Let's promote our market in Japan.

A relatively low level of a relatively large growth. The mainland market accounted for 41% in the first quarter. The mainland market YoY in 2024 was 11%. That YoY in the first quarter of 2024 was -20%. That YoY in the first quarter of this year was -20%. That was mainly what we did for our customers.

His first quarter is still clearly de-escalated in February. The return order for some of those films started in March. That basically happened in the second quarter. The Chinese market would see a more obvious one. A kinetic energy of pull-up. So the whole Chinese market would say.

The second quarter should start with one. A more obvious growth energie. That in Taiwan market currently accounts for 5% in the first quarter. That YOY is 18%. That's basically what we started with integrating some.

That started to help customers to make some brand generational operations. The future would hope for a share of Taiwan. It would also be possible to slowly start to rise. The US market just started to sell our West Wetlands products. At first began to sell in the US market. That is not high at the moment.

That will slowly begin to increase a share in the United States. That is to say, the product. In the first quarter of this year, 8.1 inside. About 48% are ordinary white tablets. That 50% is a beautiful pupil. The other 2% is functional lenses.

Some lenses such as flashes. That is to say, a different research unit. The numbers are a bit different. The relative values should be a little different. The absolute values are sometimes. Different researches may be a little different.

That would be around 10 billion in the global movie market in 2024. That would be 7.4% growth that year. That would be 6.6. That would be about 7% growth. North America is still one of the largest markets.

That year grew by about 5.6%. Europe was about 3 to 4%. Last year, the Japanese market had a growth of 6 to 7%.

So there was a growth of 6 to 7% in mainland China last year. And last year, the three online platforms grew 13%. So you can see.

It is still a very stable market. That is, if we look at Q1 of 2025. The growth of China's online can grow by 9%. Of course, we can look at this picture first. This picture is a comparison between 2024 and 2023.

That year, it was about 13% growth. The larger part of it was that it grew 108 in tone. The cat and Jingdong were in decline that day. The data from the first quarter of this year came out. From 2025, Q1 compared to last year's Q1. About 9% growth.

The same is true of the growth rate, which is a 64% growth in the tone. The Tokyo recession is relatively obvious. The decline was 11%. The cat fell about 4% that day. The whole thing was said. The first quarter was still a growth.

That is, China has entered the market. It is still a continuous growth. I still maintain my view of the online market this year. The Chinese market should still grow by about 10%. It should still be a double-digit growth. But the main growth platform is in the tone.

So, this will affect a property of consumption. The current way of selling TikTok is to bring goods or broadcast them directly from the staff. That is to say, to find people to bring goods. So, if you go live or broadcast them, it will be a better way to sell the pupil. Maybe the pattern is the same.

These types of sales will be more. Therefore, it is now seen that the demand for Chinese film market is still very strong. That is, the customer is probably on the basis of our customers.

That's why the demand for films is high. But the demand is strong. But the translucency currently seems to be relatively weak. That is estimated to be about the first half of 2025.

However, due to the demand for color, the demand is still strong.

So overall, it should have been an opinion that I have grown by 10% in the Chinese market every year. And then there is another picture that has been reported before that is to say that the entire contact lens market. The proportion of the four manufacturers Haichang is falling that is mainly a new brand slowly in the rise, so everyone in here has a new brand accounted for 47% of the rapid rise, so of course, with the platform different new brand is not different from the previous may be Mudik Lara, then Labaysna to play better than when we want to play, it may be Sweet Color Mary Doriana also a platform conversion more accustomed to that new platform play the game they will rise faster overall, and we will reorganize China's new brand Japanese brand in China's proportion is constantly down the same as the four factories. The first of our growth momentum in the mainland market in 2025 is that we supply the local market because the market changes in the current market is very fast customers after the last year of the competition of a situation, so the whole return speed will become very important in closing a small amount of mass production to the market immediately if the explosion is fast. If it is not explosive, it is likely to close the stock next batch of pattern, so the whole short-chain supply is very important, so this is because our subsidiary market is a competitive advantage because the demand for the entire crop is inflated after about April, so the bottleneck will be at us to hit at a speed that we will also in the mainland market in this year we will launch a new product in March. I am not listed first, mainly included in the four markets above the production capacity of a part of the this year will probably be expanded to more than 57 million in China plant expand the production capacity of two color film lines in China plant to expand the capacity of 3.2 million in China plant to go out the current estimated contribution to this year's production capacity of a double 11 below another expansion to contribute to the next year to the next year to be sure to say that before 618 and then update the current demand is good, so it is already determined to build the two 11 before the contribution. The above is my simple update so let's see what else we have to wait for. We are all welcome to discuss with you. Thank you all for your kind words. It's time for qa if there are any problems with investors, I will first pass the first microphone. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to handle the user request and organize the text snippet provided into paragraph text. First, I want to read through the rules and examples provided by the user to ensure that the task requirements are fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity and order of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the text text content provided and note that there is a lot of timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences separated by timestamps into a consistent paragraph while keeping the original order and content of each sentence.

For example, with regard to new products, gross profit, exchange rate problems, China market situation, etc., these may need to be segmented. At the same time, pay attention to the questions and answers in the dialogue, to ensure logical coherence, such as after the user asks, the answer should follow closely, to form a Q&A structure. During the process, you may encounter some non-Chinese content, such as "і an", "Μαùng", "lighthouse", etc., these may be speech recognition errors or special symbols. According to the user's request, you can not delete or modify anything, so you need to retain those parts, but you may need to confirm whether or not.

For example, timestamps from 883. 40 to 1340. 78, there may be multiple paragraphs in the middle, need to correct segmentation, while maintaining the corresponding relationship of timestamps. Finally, after finishing the whole paragraph type script, I will read the whole paragraph type, check whether all sentences are properly merged, no omissions or errors, and ensure that the format is in line with the user's requirements, that is, not using any Markdown, only plain text, segmentation clear, each paragraph separated by line. </think> That's the new part of the reason, because it is flashy, two-generation blue, that the general products may be one to three parts of a gross profit, so the overall reason is that it will be more than the first half of the market, and the second half of the effect of the effect is that we will be more than the most.

But just to say that this year, the whole Chinese market should have a digit growth, what should I look at? Or what kind of customer orders? Thank you ourselves, I just said that 10% of the market is the whole market, that is, online market, we estimate that last year the online market growth period, this year is about 10%, that our first quarter is recession, but we think we will still maintain a digit growth, which is mainly after April, the whole U.S. demand is still strong, that is, the current driving rate, that is, the second quarter of the driving rate, in fact, is more than 90%, whether it is Taiwan factory or mainland factory, so it is only colorful orders come back, so we think this year, the Chinese market will maintain a momentum growth, that means that I think the market demand is strong, I just said in the United States part is good, that the current customers are a transparent stock, because we are more than the last year, so it is more sales, so it is a little, so it is that the first time will be a little, but the second quarter, but the second quarter, the same, so it is a good, so it is a good.

In the second half of the year, we are currently testing, and after the final release, it is estimated that shipping should be later than 618, and should not be less than 618. Therefore, in the second half of the year, Taiwan has already shipped, and the Chinese market estimates that it may be in July. In the first quarter, Japan has a lot of growth, so you just said that growth is coming from new products, is we have to receive new big customers? Japan's growth in the first quarter, we mainly come from new customers, that new customers in Japan, regardless of the Japanese market, we have added new customers in the second half of the second quarter, and the new customers in Japan is expected to be a second time.

This is why we want to increase our share here, the second is to go to the United States, so we start to do layout and investment, that we have a short investment company, that we will be better selling, it may be Japan, it may be a good sale in the mainland, it may be a good sale in Taiwan, we sell in Taiwan, and our investment company to help our customers operate, which may be possible.

It may be that in a beauty store, it may be that these things are all our production, so for the factory, I am a bigger export of the same item, that there is no cost of these samples before, so this way to put some good things in the Taiwan market, the currency, we will also sell in Taiwan market, to increase our overall market share. That said before we mentioned that we have to start to integrate the supply chain, this is one of these projects. We are from the origin of OEM, we are not familiar with the brand operation, but we have to do not do it, so we will start to do some investment action, that from these teams to do such an action, that is to lower our share in the Taiwan market.

But if I'm just talking about it, because it's a problem everyone has encountered, the whole thing will only be affected, but it won't affect our competitiveness in the industry. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank.

And then, like our cost, is there any cost to purchase foreign currency pricing? There are parts, but most of them are mainly Taiwan dollars, but some raw materials, such as some drugs that are more chemical, from Japan or from the United States, this part will be priced in US dollars. How much is the proportion? No high, right, maybe the current proportion is not high. So, just after the closing of the film in the second quarter, the order demand is still good, so there should be no need to lower the price.

If the market, currently the whole continent of the film, the turnover ratio is about 7 to 3, he is the opposite of other markets, the other markets are about 7, like Japan, about 7, the mainland market is more, 7, and then through 3. That's just what he just mentioned about his sales model, previously in Tmall, that's easier to call, then it's now a breeze, that's a breeze, that requires a lot of color, it's easier to do a different kind of marketing. In the past, our overall expected revenue, probably through the past two years, about half, half and half.

In fact, he said that he had a lot of guinea pigs before him, which involved a lot, each little cat is znajdu in the Naruto mobile body, so to get him into the virtue of the fica value, you all love the advantages, you are the tech. Whether it is the profit rate or other negative effects, Japan's Maori will still be better than China, that is, it is the current situation, look or not. That is, of course, in the first quarter, our gross profit performance is good, in fact, with Japan's high proportion, this is also a relationship.

So, what do you think will happen in 2021 to 2024? What do you think will happen in the next four years?

Below is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase transcript: [1821. 58-1823. 18] is a relatively reasonable growth rate. [1823. 18-1825. 40] Next year growth rate. [1825. 40-1826. 88] I estimate. [1826. 88-1828. 58] is possible. [1828. 58-1830. 66] is approximately 10 to 20.

[1830. 66-1832. 38] We estimate that it may be between 10 and 20. [1832. 38-1833. 44] compound annual growth rate. [1833. 44-1836. 40] That is Taiwan and the United States. [1836. 40-1838. 70] That is, of course, if we are caught up in a large market. [1838. 70-1839. 66] It is possible to go up. [1839. 66-1840. 86] We are currently working on this.

[1840. 86-1842. 36-1842. 36] is at the current pace. [1842. 36-1844. 06] One double-digit growth every year. [1844. 06-1845. 02] is our goal. [1845. 02-1846. 96] When we enter a relatively large market, [1846. 86-1842. 18] is a big customer. [1848. 18-1848. 18-1848. 82] is a chance to repeat us like this.

[1850. 82-1853. 54] This is the time for a sudden Chinese market. [1853. 54-1854. 96] The whole market exploded. [1854. 96-1856. 58] So that time will go on. [1856. 58-1858. 04] So just catch big customers. [1858. 04-1859. 64] There was a big customer in the big market. [1859. 641861. 28] The growth rate was very fast.

[1861. 28-1864. 32] But now we have to use a relatively stable estimate. [1864. 32-1866. 00] What I want to ask now is [1866. 00-1867. 38] Taiwan and the United States. [1867. 38-1868. 40] You are now starting. [1868. 40-1869. 52] Increase the cost. [1869. 52-1871. 48] Then expand the market.

[1871. 48-1873. 62] That is exactly what it is now. [1873. 62-1875. 08] How we invest. [1875. 08-1876. 42] How much we want to spend. [1876. 42-1879. 16] There is no way to check your future growth. [1879. 16-1880. 48] Can not make a statement. [1880. 48-1880. 88] Thank you.

[1880. 88-1886. 36] The cost you refer to is that the government is strictly regulated. [1886. 36-1890. 86] I think that's why. [1890. 86-1893. 56] This piece we actually have. [1893. 56-1894. 32] Taiwan is actually here. [1894. 32-1897. 00] The current operation status is not good. [1897. 00-1898. 22] So this piece.

[1898. 40-1900. 62] should be able to stop the loss soon. [1900. 62-1902. 02-1903. 62] should stop the loss soon. [1903. 62-1907. 10] The United States may take a couple of years. [1907. 10-1910. 16] But we will control this expense. [1910. 16-1912. 24] So if you look at the loss.

[1912. 24-1914. 92] One month may be possible. [1914. 92-1916. 64] I don't think much. [1916. 64-1919. 36] It is also possible to have two or three million levels. [1919. 36-1920. 44] Not much. [1920. 44-1921. 92] So if the investment is diverted. [1921. 92-1924. 96] I think it is estimated that this is possible to use to estimate this.

[1924. 96-1926. 92] We certainly hope to be faster. [1926. 92-1927. 52] That's why. [1927. 52-1929. 98] Each business entity wants its own profit and loss. [1929. 98-1932. 24] So we hope to find one soon. [1932. 24-1934. 02] The profit and loss balance point. [1934. 02-1937. 86] The contribution to the funds received.

[1937. 86-1939. 72] It will not be a big annualization. [1939. 72-1942. 72] in Taiwan and the United States. [1942. 72-1944. 22] We also have a million dollars. [1944. 22-1947. 42] If that is the case, we estimate the growth of revenue. [1947. 42-1948. 72] It can reach the level. [1948. 72-1951. 18] It is still uncertain.

[1951. 18-1953. 08] Especially in the United States of America. [1953. 08-1954. 42] Because it was just beginning to expand. [1954. 42-1956. 52] That United States was slowly going to show. [1956. 52-1957. 52] The outlook of the Time Center. [1957. 52-1959. 44] So it is still studying the market. [1959. 44-1961. 00] So it is not clear at this time.

[1961. 00-1963. 36] The first step we need to take right now is to go first. [1963. 36-1965. 08] It is to go first to the balance point. [1965. 08-1968. 64] I estimate that it is also a point between one and two years. [1968. 64-1970. 76] First to the balance point in a single month. [1975. 52-1978. 24] It is necessary for the U.S. market to pass a prescription. [1978. 24-1980. 50] It is a relatively difficult time to expand the market.

[1980. 50-1981. 48] But he has his difficulties. [1981. 48-1982. 36] He also has his benefits. [1982. 36-1983. 20] It is difficult. [1983. 20-1984. 56] But when he does it. [1984. 56-1986. 42] His gross profit is relatively good. [1986. 42-1987. 36] Because of the speed of growth.

[1987. 36-1988. 88] It will be slightly slower. [1988. 88-1990. 12] That is, of course, except for the expansion. [1990. 12-1992. 16] Mainly because we want to use this pattern. [1992. 16-1994. 44] Bring our products to the market. [1994. 44-1995. 68] Let the market know us. [1995. 68-1997. 44] Because it is as it is now.

[1997. 44-1999. 96] The U.S. market does not really know what the expectation is. [1999. 96-2001. 20] So we want this model. [2001. 20-2003. 64] Let these doctors know what the expectation products are. [2003. 64-2005. 60] I found that there is a company in Taiwan here. [2005. 60-2006. 44] The product is also good. [2006. 44-2007. 80]

[2007. 80-2008. 68. 80] There is another way. [2008. 68-2010. 80] We hope to get some OEM orders. [2010. 80-2013. 72] The main revenue conference comes from these OEM orders. [2013. 72-2017. 28] But I want to get into this market first. [2017. 36-2018. 18] China guess. [2018. 36-2020. 44] Do not think.

[2020. 54-2022. 12] Some in Hope pump. [2022. 12-2023. 10] Except peony. [2023.-10-2024. 58] Can be styled. [2024. 58-2037. 42] Let these stocks always agog. [2037. 42-039. 08] This is what we're looking at. [2039. 08-2023. 42] We're urgently inçeup.

[2040. 48-2041. 92] In the cover is here. [2041. 92-2044. 82] This is our 장 and our stuff. [2044. 82-2046. 32] We have also been replaced. [2046. 64-2047. 34] 10 paid. [2047. 36-2055. 56] There are no problems. [2055. 56-2058. 04] If you don't wait for a moment, I will stay.

[2058. 04-2060. 16] I will stay after [2060. 16-2061. 40] I will stay. [2061. 40-2062. 64] You can also communicate. [2062. 64-2064. 92] Because many people are like some old friends faces. [2064. 92-2066. 76] You are a bit familiar. [2066. 76-2071. 16] If you have no further questions.

[2071. 16-2073. 02] Today's law will come to an end. [2073. 02-2075. 30] After the meeting, the company will stay on the scene. [2075. 30-2076. 34] To communicate with you. [2076. 34-2078. 62] Finally, I wish you all a smooth and healthy investment. [2078. 62-2079. 00] Thank you. [2079. 00-2080. 34] Thank you all.
