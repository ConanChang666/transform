Welcome to all resources and Аляon. Basically break up your English. Download the reference for yourself. Next, I will explain the company in a sequential manner. Written on the two core businesses of retail. Operational results.

The results of the first phase of operations. Welfare policy. And one of our sustainable performance. After the briefing, there will be an open Q&A session. The guarantee industry was established in 1969 and was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1990.

In writing business, the company has a long-term commitment to multiple capacity layout, and early adopt a multi-brand foundry strategy, quickly established the scale advantage. Today, the industry is the world's leading manufacturer of footwear and shoe manufacturing foundry design. It is an international manufacturer such as Nike Adidas ASIS New Balance and Solomon.

In order to enhance the overall value of the company, the industry is also engaged in property development and tourism hotel business.

In order to further expand our operations, our consolidated revenue for the first quarter of this year was NT$670.3 billion, an increase of 5.9% from the same period last year. This growth is mainly due to the robustness of these business orders, which effectively offset the relatively weak impact of retail sales. These businesses continue to be the main source of consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2025. Due to the order dynamics of key brand customers, double shipments and average sales have increased from the same period last year.

Consolidated revenue increased to 65.2%. While some of the retail business is relatively stable online sales, one overall sales project was the primary source of consolidated revenue in the first quarter of 2025. The consumer environment remains complex and consumer shopping behaviour is becoming more conservative.

For other businesses, it mainly comes from hotels in Taichung Jade Garden Garden Hotel, which is 100% owned by the guarantee industry. The combined revenue ratio is only 0.4%. Relatively insignificant. That we can see from a chart on the sixth page, as part of these businesses from 2022 to 2024.

In 2023, due to an increase in overall economic downturn risk, the level of industry inventory is at a relatively high level. This led to operational challenges. That we saw in 2024, a robust recovery in the global footwear market as the industry inventory cycle ended.

The average selling price has also increased year-on-year. A solid growth in support of these businesses. Part of the retail business, from 2022 to 2024. We see that the retail environment has been disrupted by several things such as the pandemic, market fluctuations, and macroeconomics.

The main operating region was fully closed by the end of 2022, driving a revenue in 2023. This led to a high-digit growth in 2022, which was then impacted by a macro growth in 2024. The sales performance was once again under pressure. This first quarter of this year, as just mentioned. The retail environment was still complex and varied, with a constant fluctuation in customer traffic.

A consumer demand in the main operating areas is still relatively weak. Then we first saw a part of these businesses. These businesses are in fact a continuous expansion in the scale of operations in Taiwan. With a flexible sourcing strategy for brand customers, and active use of overseas manufacturing advantages, we gradually move the production center out of Taiwan. In 1988, we set up the first production line overseas in mainland China.

After that, he moved to Indonesia in 1992. In 1994, he set up a factory in Vietnam. He also set up production sites in Bangladesh and Myanmar, Cambodia. Currently, Indonesia and Vietnam are the three main production sites in mainland China.

In terms of doubles, the total production volume for the first quarter of 2025 was 61.9 million pairs, up by 5.3% from the same period last year. Indonesia Vietnam and China accounted for 55%, 31% and 10% of the total production volume, including Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. The average price for the first quarter of 2025 was $20.04 per kilogram, an increase of 2.5% from the same period last year, and ended a trend falling in five consecutive quarters.

In terms of the US dollar, sales of footwear products increased by 7.8% in the first quarter of this year, while revenues from soles and other categories decreased by 14.9% in the second quarter of this year, so the overall sales of one shoe business increased by 5.9% in the first quarter of this year. That was partly because of the impact of the U.S. exchange rate, the first quarter of 2020 saw a 6.5% decrease in revenue in the first quarter of 2020, followed by a detailed explanation in the old retail business. That part of September, we can see that the recent industry's operating performance, in a fraction of the gross profit margin, which has remained at about 23% to 25% since 2021, has included a retail business performance.

In addition, we also added a new production line that is still climbing a stage, plus a 7.5% year-on-year increase in the number of these businesses at the end of March 2025, which also led to a new increase in labor costs. Then we saw that Baosheng International is a part of the retail business. In the retail business, it was a division of the staffing industry that was different from the retail business in terms of business thinking and continued to grow with a retail scale. In 2008, the retail business was separated from the staffing industry, and now it is one of the leading sports retailers in Greater China.

In addition, the B2C platform can also be divided into apartment platforms, which we mainly work with Tmall JD and other third-party platforms, hoping to effectively expand the sales scale. In the private domain, we launched WeChat's activation program in February 2020, which is an extension of WeChat's activity as a physical store, combining Tmall's online shopping activity, the mall membership platform to build an ecosystem of stores, this part of which has a more effective sales conversion rate, which can effectively promote the current increase in sales and increase the recurrence rate, hoping to achieve a high-quality incremental service.

As for RMB 2025 revenue in the 2025 quarter, RMB is 51.7 billion, which is a part of a decrease of 5.4% a year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like most of the content is duplicated, for example, "the seriousness of the industry discount competition in terms of profitability" has appeared many times, and the timestamp is also continuous. This may be because the same phrase is repeated multiple times in the recording, or the technical issue leads to repeated records. Next, the user mentioned another problem is about the decline in ex-industrial revenue, which is more detailed, involving multiple data points and interpretations.

For example, some parts of the industry discount competition may be repeated multiple times, but all duplicate sentences must be kept. Then there are questions about the transfer of investment, this part has several sentences that need to be arranged logically to form a coherent paragraph. Finally, about customer adjustments and the Gahtar/Zepyr section, as well as the subscription requests at the end, these also need their own paragraphs. It is important to note that users specifically point out that they cannot delete anything, so even if some sentences repeat or may be wrong, they must keep it. For example, some parts of the timestamp may seem to have some time to jump between [1881. 08-1883. 08] and [1911. 08-1918. 44], but the user does not point out the problem, so it must be handled as it.

In addition, there are some non-Chinese content in the middle, such as "Gahtar and Zephyr currently do not taste new beverage" and mixed Russian vocabulary, which may need to be retained as well, but users do not require translation or processing, so you can copy it directly. During the process, I need to make sure that the corresponding sentences are placed correctly in each timestamp and that all the contents are separated by a line.

In the first quarter of this year, the decline in revenue outside the industry was the main part of the investment.

The overall reinvestment of the future is more obvious. The overall reinvestment of the future is more obvious. This part of the value-added reduction. In the first quarter of this year, an out-of-the-network net income. As just mentioned, it is likely to be a net reduction of $82.9 billion.

That's the part. Except for what we just mentioned. That is to say, a shift in equity law has decreased. It's likely that the overall price has decreased by $2.54 billion. That's what it includes, too. It's based on the first quarter of this year.

The exchange interest decreased by $1.4 billion. In addition, last year there was a relatively low return on investment. In the first quarter of that year, it was relatively small. This part was about two-stage declines. It was probably a difference of $1.6 billion.

The net profit of the Qinglong commodity. It also reduced about 156 million yuan. The overall part of the investment. There is no one at the moment. A plan to increase or decrease the value. In the first quarter of this year.

We have a small part of it that is dispensed. Nanbao invests in this transfer with the third party. But this ratio is relatively small. If there is a larger portion of the acquired or dispensed assets in the future, we will also be in accordance with the administrative law.

The next question is to ask. Is there an adjustment to FOB quotes for terminal customers at the moment. This situation has not been heard yet. Gahtar and Zephyr currently don't taste the new beverage. We're looking at it now. It's probably in the position.

He has a client. She has been staying in a power upside down hydro. She may be inappropriately. She has spent more than 100 Edges. Other Chinese business opportunities.

And he said to them, "Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's heart is deceitful above all things, and his mind is deceitful above all things, and his mouth is deceitful above all things, and his mouth is deceitful above all things, and his mouth is deceitful above all things, and his mouth is deceitful above all things, and his mouth is deceitful above all things."
