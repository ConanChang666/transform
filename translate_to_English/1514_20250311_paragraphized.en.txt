Today we are very happy to invite the editors to help us, is to participate in today's forum. First of all, let's introduce today's team, first of all, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the board of directors of directors, the board of directors of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of the boards, the boards, the board of the boards, the board of the board of directors, the board of the board of the board of the board of the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of directors, the boards, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the boards, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the boards, the boards, the board of directors, the boards, the boards, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, the board of directors, Our company's employees are 700 people, about 700 people, our main production base includes, the Yangmei factory in Taiwan, this is later added to Taiwan, because only a lot of foreign investment will visit, they will ask Yangmei in which country, Xinzhuang where, and then simply added Taiwan, so it is more clear, our Yangmei factory in Taiwan is about 11000 square meters, about 30 years ago bought, in fact, our origin is in Xinzhuang factory, 50 years ago bought 3600 square meters, when we bought, the price of one ping land is about 2500 yuan, now we hear that there is about 500 million dollars, so it is about 200 times more value, recently because Yangmei factory was also built, almost almost all of them were used, so it was close to the government to accept Bilin to change industrial land, so we bought 4500 squares of Bilin land, but because there there was a bit a bit of a bit more than a bit of land, we can be a bit more to buy a lot of land.

Yangmei plant mainly consists of electric power, including the power distribution plate, the power distribution plate, including the central cabinet high and low voltage plate MCC and GIS, the transformer one production is a grinding transformer, oil-in transformer and non-steroidal transformer, transformer two is the main production station of electric power, as well as the battery, the power supply two is the main production station of the power supply, as well as the battery, the power supply two is the main production of the relevant transmission and distribution equipment for the power grid, the new factory is mainly to do some electrical and electronic products, including communication power system SM, three UPS, solar current inverter, electric bus electric motor, as well as electric vehicle chargers for rail vehicles, and the newly developed four conductors, the interval, this is used in the ultra-high-voltage air line, and also the high-voltage power tower above, which will be a more detailed complement, let you know the purpose of the use of the electric power grid, and we are the most of the most of the most of the most of the next, we are the next, we have the most of the most of the most of the new products, we are the same.

This is the two-part switch, which is used in the switch power grid, then the second is after the new transformer factory is completed, it is expected to get an improved and typed transformer every year, about 10 to 1.5 billion orders, the third is gas condensation substation GIS, Ari and associated companies can get each year to get 1.5 billion orders, and each year rise, this is mainly we have an investment in a name, JIA electric motor, investment accounted for 30 percent, he is most likely to contribute to us every year, because he did do a year, and then make more than 200 million million dollars, every year can contribute to our industry revenue. The third part of the field is the rail industry, which is a little different from our peers, because we are the first to enter the relevant field, because we are with the Ni-Ya Ni-Ya signal, Japan signal, Japan signal, Japan signal, Taiwan railway is a lot of use of the Japanese signal equipment, then we should cooperate with it should be twenty-three years, the railway signal control and monitoring system, that the company has already obtained including Taiwan Railway Chiayi, Chiayi elevated and Tainan underground and Huadong threading.

Well, the second is the telecommunications switch room, there is a communication base, DC high frequency power switch, which we are also to give more, that telecommunications company, of course, China Telecom is the most handed over, for domestic and foreign 5G 6G market, is the continued promotion, and has been, every year to get some of their new places, the other electric bus, the bus charging installation, the government announced by 2030, the country there are about 10,000 electric bus needs, the next five years, because in fact, it is really the first five years, because the government has some budget squeeze, so it is very slow, some electric bus operators may have waited for, because they may have all be lost.

The electric vehicle charging installation, this part is, because the future of electric vehicles, should be more and more, the government is also announced in 2040.

The company has developed its own self-developed 160KV and 240KV DC fast charging package, which is also the agent of Spain's production of well-known product Wobux, which is the AC slow charging package.

In addition, the electric charging equipment for rail vehicles for railway cars is too old to replace the new demand, and that Ayali is the only manufacturer in China to develop a successful train, this part is usually placed in front of the front or the last, it has a very large thing, it is called a charger, that part is to provide the whole car with air conditioning and lighting. We have provided Taiwan MRT and Shanghai Intercity Railway to provide more than 3000 shipments, and the government has actively promoted the construction of railways under the policy of the future train too old and new demand growth period.

So in 2024, the first three quarters compared to 2023 or increased, but the fourth quarter because last year's basis period was relatively high, so the whole calculation is 88 billion, so this part of this part will probably also briefly mention that the part of the difference is mainly because the engineering income is some jobs compared to those delayed parts, which will actually be completed this year's year's year. Operating overview This part may be with you sorry for the fact that we opened the fourth quarter of the year just after the Board of Directors, so EPS can only be with you to report to the previous three quarters of the previous quarter is 2.19 It may be slightly revealed that our absolute value is a little higher than the previous year or the overall profit, or the absolute value of innovation.

In addition, most of the top 500 companies we contact, and then each of their owners, under the trend of ESG, they have higher requirements for human rights and safety on the construction site, which is also conducive to the improvement of engineering gross profit, the second is that some of us have received the calculation of rail engineering, because it is difficult to work with the requirements, so the salary and cost are relatively high, so this part of the gross profit is also reasonable to increase. For example, for example, it must be said that it must wait for the rail engineering to arrive at the MRT or Taiwan Railway before they start the train and then wait until the time before it ends the train, and then we can start to complete all of the construction project in the middle of the night, so it is really difficult and hard to do. Then the topic 8 is that the future management and development strategy is summarized here is the six key aspects of the operation of the semiconductor market, the company is an important supply chain for several semiconductor companies in the domestic semiconductor companies.

In addition to the construction of the whole plant in Singapore we have sent people past, to assist him to complete the construction of the plant, the largest semiconductor in the country we mainly provide equipment, because there are some local system integration companies to do the integration. The second is the business opportunities that AI has brought in in the future, the company has helped Chunghwa Telecom a lot of IDC power plants and transformers, accumulated many years of experience, because AI is very energy-consuming industry, and his data processing needs a lot of energy to support, and he will increase his thermal energy when computing power, so this part of the company needs to do a lot of cooling, so the power supply needs more electricity, and the power supply supply of the power supply of the GIS, as well as the power supply of this phenomenon will be provided to the company. The fourth is the promotion of solar energy storage, and also the charging installation, which is in terms of energy storage, is that we now have 20 feet to push and 40 feet of containers, that with the well-known battery manufacturers to do supporting, the future will be sold at home and abroad, the second is the charging installation, the development of 90 160 and 240, 200 is also certified, the future is also, some market machine, charging installation, this third point is the development of microgrid, the use of Delta's battery and energy storage system, combined with the self-developed energy management system EMS, and the self-produced GIOS, non-s sperm transformer, a complete industrial microgrid system, and actively promote this microgrid energy storage system, help enterprises to do a net-profit view and green energy transformation, because you know that this green energy is, its power is not stable, and it is necessary to be able to cooperate with the storage, and the microgrid, and can do some functions. In addition to strengthening the existing dealer system, including Europe and South East Asia and South Africa, which for Southeast Asian emerging market infrastructure, but also the demand advantage, we will grow experience, there will be competitive product technology, such as power switchgear, grinding voltage, solar inverter, micro grid energy storage equipment, electric bus electric vehicle track charging hub, charging charger and system integration technology, the other U.S. infrastructure business opportunities, also for charging equipment, there is also a large space exchange needs, this part of the U.S., because of this part, some is investors, he actually had to call to ask, he said, we do not do very much, we have to investigate data, we have done in 1991, we have sold, a whole set of distribution boards sold in the U.S. Berkeley, then a billion, that the power plant in Guam, about 10 years ago, we have a lot of factory, we have a lot of new addition to give a lot of them, if we do not have a lot of the same, because of them, because we do not give them, and then, because we do not know about the same, and then, and then, because we do not give them, and then, because we do not give a lot of what they do not give them, and then, and then, the same the same, the same, the same, and then, we do not give a lot of the same, and then, and then, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, we do not give the same, and then, and then, the same, the same, the same, we do not give the same, we do not give the same, we do not give the same, the same, and then, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same,

We are very concerned about the direction of Taipower, Taipower's direction, Taipower's practice, so we may pay close attention to the direction of the future development, then we will come to you to explain, because in the future development, we may very much pay attention to the direction of Taipower, and then we will report to you, because in response to Taipower's strong plan to complete about 4 years early, so many power switch, materials and engineering.

We are also actively working in the implementation of Taipower, which is also, we have been working with Taipower to catch up with, is to catch up with, and pick up the order, that is, we are more focused on the switch in the medium-voltage electric motor, especially the automatic switch, such as the automatic underground four-way switch, or the underground two-way switch, automation switch, and space switch, which is where we are more focused. In addition, it is also the GIS, the so-called GIS, the insulating gas, the gas insulating switch, the power switch, and then we are not only very focused in the automation switch, and the number of the acquisition is stable growth, and that is just the product, we have just mentioned in addition to the electric power supply, which is the next next, and the next is the development of the ECO. This is very helpful for the function of the so-called blue electric north transmission, then we are also in this, then the part of our so-called accessories, all to be replaced, then the transformer, that last year we built the transformer, the transformer is also used, that is, there are about 20,000 towers, the needs of the accessories, nearly 1.2 million, the 1.2 million is just the so-called, the so-called sub-conductor and four-conductor dividers in Taiwan, the so-called sub-conductor and four-conductor dividers in Taiwan, but also we have been qualified to punish, because we have been approved by Taipower, because we are a company.

So we just said that many exports to the United States, or even Japan or even Germany, we have been operating, then, the transformer is also focused on the medium pressure 36kV or less, which, especially the oil wet transformer, especially the energy-saving cost of gold transformer is also good, orbital rectifier, rectifier transformer, there is also a special type of transformer for energy storage, but also with the domestic well-known manufacturers of the future development, this is really can be expanded, so the so-called international market, and especially just said that, we have obtained the qualifications of Taipower, this report with us, we have passed a stereotype test, and then expect that next year we will continue to start, the next year we will report, the strong plans, the transformer will be replaced, it, that it, that it should be two years, it should be, about 20 billion, we will be used, we will be about the same, then, and then, we will be the next year, we will be the same, the same, we will be the same, we will be the same as the same, the same, we will be the same as the next year, and then, we will be the same, we will be the same with the same as the next year, the same, we will be the same with the same, we will be the next year, the same, the same, the same, we will be the next year, we will be the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same as the same, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same, the same,

We also want to provide, we want to improve self-control, domestic production, even if it is stable production, we can even export, this is a big business opportunity, especially the part of SAKE-ON, just mentioned, in the three manufacturers, four of them, our Aali performance is the best, the most well-known, the best of the four manufacturers. In addition, there are a lot of other words, to indicate a lot of projects, the project part, I do not do more about it here, that just mentioned why last year's turnover is relatively low, but the profit has risen, mainly because of our own production line more, so called home-made rate increase, so just some direction of research and development, new product development direction, is a focus on the important, and then supplement the above report, thank you.
