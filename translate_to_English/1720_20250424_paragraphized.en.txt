We are pleased to invite you to join us as a member of the conference. We are delighted to invite you to join us as a member of the conference.

First of all, we would like to introduce you to the main management team of Santa Chemical, let us applaud the Chairman of Fan Tzu-Ting and the Chief Financial Officer of Chan Ching-Wen. Then we would like to congratulate you on the presentation of this presentation.

Established in 1967, the Santa Group has grown over 50 years and has now become a pharmaceutical company that spans the Western Medicine and Health Nutrition. The manufacturing of Western Medicine and Health Nutrition and its manufacturing of raw materials, and at present, the Santa Group has been a Santa, growth, and ecology three-quarters of companies. In terms of channel layout, we have three short-term investment companies that are well-known for the sale of domestic and foreign cancer drugs, the puppy is part of the domestic channel, and then in March 2024, and then the end wall part, it belongs to the agency sales of infant formula and health care products.

As a result, the Group has increased its revenues and expenditures by 29.6%, due to the impact of other revenues on the exchange. The overall EPS, at 4.93% in 2024, compared to last year's 0.26. Observe the quarterly revenues of nearly five years, as the S.T. operation strategy is basically a stable and stable portion, and the quarterly revenues are essentially 0.26 percent in 2024 compared to the same period last year's, but grew by 5% to 10%. The S.T. Group considers the overall fund conversion last year, and we decided to repay the excess working capital for bank loans, so we can see that the S.T.S. Group's debt ratio of 9.7% in 2024, and 27.3% is also a substantial decrease in the current situation, so S.

Our benefit distribution grew from 1.2 billion yuan in 2010 to the current annual share of 2.8 billion yuan. We have two important subsidiaries: ecological and growth. Ecologically speaking, we can see from its nearly five-year situation, in addition to its 2021 part due to the fire relationship, so it fell from more than 6,200 yuan, followed by a synthesis plant that merged with Santa, and it was able to rebuild its capacity, so its profit is gradually restored, in the last year its profit and EPS profit history is new high.

This is more than a report on the operating results of the production group in 2024. The following is a report by our chairman on the operating strategy and corporate social responsibility in the future. Good afternoon, then I will talk to you about the operation strategy of the future. In fact, the production from about 67 years ago or until now, it is almost the same strategy, that is, it is actually more difficult to say how much growth you want to grow each year in Taiwan.

That's just the three companies that were born under the birth, last year was 4.93, ecology was 8.82, production was 8.86. Of course, the production of the COVID was actually the highest peak, because there was that cloud capsule factory began to put in, and then because it was still part of the TFDA that it belonged to that raw material, so it took a long time to increase its operating costs, so it was not as high as the previous profit here, but that is a good thing, there are eight EPS on that ecology and production.

The Department of Health has mentioned that it is a well-known pharmaceutical company for Taiwan. If you have the first two listed companies, if you have a patent challenge, if you are useful. Taiwan's raw materials. When the raw materials of the raw materials of the pharmaceutical company, it will have a better one.

He said, 'Yes, it was in January, but so far, it has not been announced.'

These offers have not yet been implemented, but are subject to current tariffs. Perhaps what we see is not coming, so this is the benefit. It is probably for the famous pharmaceutical company. It does not exist.

This may also be the case, for the United States to not be too heavy for our tariff class, so we don't want to say anything, but accept that this offer is.

No, it doesn't. That's why we're here. One of the people who can go to the market is the P4. That's the Paragraph 4 is a challenge patent. And he can also have a one-year period. And that hypertension.

Diabetes is, in fact, the one, the future, the one that has the most patent expiration date, the disease, the diabetes.

The original patent period. From 2025 to 2030. From 2025 to 2030.

"This is what the Lord says: 'This is what the LORD says: 'Let us make known unto us, that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him, and that we may know him.'

There is no such thing as righteousness, and there is no such thing as righteousness.

This is the land of the living, the land of the dead, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the dead, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living.

It was three years before COVID had slowed down, and it wasn't really stopped, so we went back and forth.

This year, we have a lot of evidence for that. So this is a good one. Two of these should be. The turnover is the best. One of them may be the one with diabetes.

We will not increase too much. Then we will calculate it. Because we used to calculate it before COVID. At that time the technology of the continent was not as good as it is now.

They were so fast that the electrons were then compared to the current one. I was so bad that I said that his electric car was more than that of Tesla. And the wheat was much more so, so the technology of the continent was also calculated as fast as we are.

There is no such thing as a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior, or a savior.

It's been six years. He's probably the one in Japan. He's probably the one in Japan. When you get a certificate, you want to guarantee that you can't get out of stock in five years, so here's why we're still shipping.

It's just that. It's been five years and now that he's been talking about it. It's been five years and we're shipping in Japan. That's two more signings then two. In your eyes, that's what it means.

"You have to do it first," he said, "and you have to do it, and you have to do it, and you have to do it, and you have to do it.

Technical documentation. There is a formulation to do the Pilot and then the number to talk to him is almost the first thing to do. So this is. The meaning of that in the eyes of the other agent signal there will be more time. The agent signal is about three years, so it is still now. On going.

In fact, Taiwan still uses signals. He doesn't say which country you are listed in in Japan in the U.S. He is looking at you as a mode of censorship. So some are listed abroad in Taiwan or can't be listed. Because he is independent.

He is the only one in the world who will not let you go out of the city, so this is the third time we've been in this city for so many years.

"We have a lot to say about this," he said, "and we have a lot to say about this, and we have a lot to say about this," he said, "and we have a lot to say about this.

This year, we set up a subsidiary in Thailand to promote Southeast Asia. And of course, the other is.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided verbatim fragments into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of each timestamp corresponding sentence. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentences to see if they are correct. It looks like the user has arranged the content in chronological order, so the next task is to merge the sequential paragraphs and maintain the integrity of the original sentences. It should be noted that some sentences may be sequentially or logically, and should be merged into the same paragraphs, while others belong to different themes that need to be handled separately.

When dealing with Chinese parts, it is important to pay attention to whether the format of the timestamp is consistent, and whether the connection between sentences is natural. At the same time, the user mentions "do not delete any sentences" which means that no modifications can be made even if some sentences look duplicated or inconsistent.

In addition, the user has some time to post the corresponding sentences, such as "[1428. 36-1429. 72] and "[1429. 96-1430. 36]", which need to be kept as they are and may require appropriate segmentation, but not to be deleted or modified. During the processing process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the parts of the Chinese and English mixed, such as "[1611. 32-1629. 58] and "[1683. 52-1685. 62]", which require proper segmentation to ensure that the Chinese and English content is properly handled. Finally, the finishing paragraph texts need to meet the user's requirements, that each paragraph consists of a continuous timestamp and sentence, without missing any content, and retains the original timestamp format.

If you don't want to miss out on this, you'll want to know how much better it is for your child. If you don't want to miss out on this, you'll want to know how much it is for your child. If you don't want to miss out on this, don't miss out! If you want to miss out on this, don't miss out! If you want to miss out on this opportunity, don't miss out! If you want to know more about it, just go ahead and join us! If you want to know more about it, don't miss out! The third mittlerweile doesn't know how to give blood every year, just how to let the staff because of the fact that we are more and more able to donate blood because of the fact that we are less and less able to donate because of a person's decline as a 65-year-old can't forget that he has a time when you can no longer donate more and more of what we are trying to donate now, more and more of what we will donate now, and we will make a record anyway, so as long as you don't donate 10 times, no matter where you don't donate the company will give you the prize, so it's probably OK for you.

What is the tariff that he actually leads to? In fact, what is his tariff? In fact, he leads to the global drug supply chain problems, or even the problem of drug shortage, please talk about the second is whether born or not to meet such problems, how do we prevent such problems? The third is that we are born in the United States, how do we deal with such problems? Thank you so much for this. It is the largest in the United States that requires all the other countries in the world to see how the drug is to be treated. We have a large number of small molecules and small molecules that are now on the market.

But he was there, and he was there, and he was there, and he was there for a little while, and he was there for a little while, and he was there for a little while, and he was there for a little while, and he was there for a little while, and he did not go to the United States for a little while.

So, let's start with the original. Because it has a big impact on the U.S. side. For the original, it has an impact on the U.S. side.

That is to say, his volume is so much. That is the most in India. And the other is the mainland is the raw material. Those two are 20 percent.

And when they do, they will be able to say, 'If he does, he will be able to do it,' and if he does not do it, he will be able to do it, and if he does not do it, he will be able to do it.

You will only be able to pay for what you have, but you will be able to pay for what you have, and you will be able to pay for what you have, and you will be able to pay for what you have.

You just buy high or low. But these high words go to the United States. In fact, he will go to other parts of the world. So for the whole point of view, I think I say to use this piece of medicine.

It's because it's essential. That's the time. For example, if you buy a car for five years, it's good to learn more. But if you can't say it, I won't eat it this year.

He said, "It's time for you to go to the hospital, and you're going to go to the hospital, especially chronic diseases, so the amount doesn't decrease. That's just when you don't decrease the amount, but instead you increase the amount.

And when he saw that he was rich, he was poor; and when he saw that he was poor, he was poor: and when he saw that he was poor, he was poor: and when he saw that he was poor, he was poor: and when he saw that he was poor, he was poor: and when he saw that he was poor, he was poor, he was poor.

This was the first time we had been to the United States, where we sold only two items, and the amount of that amount was not that high.

It is not easy for him to do so, but it is easy for him to do so, and he will be rewarded for it, and he will be rewarded for it, and he will be rewarded for it, and he will be rewarded for it.

This is because all the sales are there, so we assume it's good, then it's 30%, then it's about 5%, and then it's over.

"We have a great deal to do," he said, "and we have a great deal to do, and we have a great deal to do, and we are not going to be able to do that for a long time.

When you see the end of the promise, you will see the end of the promise; when you see the end of the promise, you will see the end of the promise; when you see the end of the promise, we will know how big the impact is, but there is something to say, we will probably not have too much impact.

This is how you thank the Lord for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you, and for what He has done for you.

So if it looks like this, let's say that live. Today, we can still maintain the same growth as in the last few years. That means that this year, we can maintain the growth of 5% to 10%. That is to say, we can keep the growth.

That's less than 5%. Well, that's because we can't say numbers. So I can only grow. So it's not as bad as last year.

It's not as bad as it was last year. I'll add it again. I really want to ask you a question. It's because we're just the general manager. It's what the Chairman and the Chairman emphasize. But it's because we're here.

As you can see, the number of the combined earnings is the number of the so-called combined earnings, so we are actually the three Lords, for example, we have about 67 billion dollars a year.

32 billion, then the second is the growth, about 2 billion.

The other part is the ecological part. That the overall tariffs are related to the living part. The general manager has just mentioned it. Then we grab other tariffs. The other two of us may have problems. The first is the production part.

He made health food. Then he faced the challenge of the club. That is, I. Customs he might encounter the challenge. That is, he is a skincare product.

The part of the import of skincare products. Currently only 30%. It will not be affected afterwards. You can see from some newspapers and magazines. It is the whole effect of the government and their strategy.

After growth. The so-called import sales price of health food products. It has an impact on the market. The second part about the impact of these strategies on the CMO. The other part of our ecology is wonderful.

About 90% of it. That's probably selling to the United States. It's about 16% down. It's about 16% down. There's a question about ecology. That's why it's now.

The entire U.S. tariff policy is not fixed. So it is also difficult to assess exactly what impact it will have. So we have the general manager. Our chairman and general manager have continued to ask the same person.

So what is the specific meaning of that right now? It should be that no one knows at the moment. So I just mentioned it. I can ask the whole life.

It also includes ecology and production. It is three companies. The issue of tariffs is actually not the same. Yes, it does not say that these three companies are less than they were last year. Our goal is to compare to a recession.

What is the impact of this tariff guarantee, when to when to decide, what is the impact of the proportion, should not be able to determine this. There is no way to tell you a definitive answer? Of course, our internal goal is to hope, from the chairman said, we want to grow steadily, efforts, this is the goal. Because in fact, for long-term investors, in fact, under such an atmosphere, we are all looking for a very stable company.

I want to know, just mentioned in the last five years, the company's profit is always innovative, what kind of a COVID, because people say that the crisis has two words, one is dangerous, another is the opportunity, so he can be out of stock, we can also that, there is no raw material can be sold, but we spend a lot of data in the first year, and spend a lot of that energy to determine our raw materials, can enter, so when the change is made, we can see that we can have goods to buy, others goods, or so we can say that we are from COVID, from the two pieces of money, then three more, then four pieces, so that the sweetest thing is the sweetest thing has passed.

What is the most sweet thing about the past? The sweetest, it used to be one, two, and then it's ten, so now it's about four, and it's hard work, thank you. There are other investment before there are questions, hey, the chairman is good, then I want to ask two questions, that first is our dividend penalty, of course, the total number of shares is improved, but in terms of the penalty rate, 70% of the previous years fell to 60%, now to more than 50%, what is the reason?

If you want to know more about this product, please contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you want to know more about this product, please do not hesitate to contact us. You said to drag our goods, should be good, we don't need to come in the same way.

The answer is: We don't have to merge in. We need more than 20% to merge. Because we have to face more than 20% of his shareholding, we should do a reciprocal action privately. Maybe you want to know how he reacts to changes in the stock price.

So, what he's up to now, I'm going to judge that he's not going to affect the market where the private stock price changes are going. So, he won't say that there's an increase in the market. But that's not directly reflected in the present.

I'm already afraid. Is there any investment advanced to ask questions? No, we're going to have to ask the question. We're going to see the Falun Gong demonstration today? We're going to end here. Thank you for your support and your investment advanced participation.

This is the end of our activity today. We ask that you all be able to feel sorry for yourself. All is well and the investment is smooth. Thank you.
