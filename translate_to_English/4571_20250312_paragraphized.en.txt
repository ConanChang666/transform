Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. We're here to invite the military international, where the general manager of the site, Mr. Tou and Mr. Cao we're going to give our time to our colleagues, there's not much time. I want to say thank you to Yongfeng for this time to help us host this event, and to invite us to this time.

If you are interested, welcome to take pictures, this photo will not reveal the problem, because there is no drawing you can not do. First of all, this disclaimer, today's word is like the previous two years, we made a way to do it every quarter. The first is a review of the previous quarter's operating results, and then it's Q&A time.

First of all, look at the part of our comprehensive value-added table, the fourth quarter of our revenue was NT$8.29028000, which grew by 15.21 per cent, and a year-on-year growth of 35.72 per cent. This quarter was also the best quarter in our history. The gross profit of that quarter was NT$26998 million, a quarter of which grew by 24.43 per cent, and a quarter of that year by 60.06 per cent. It also included factors that I had a relatively large impact on gross profit, in addition to revenue growth, and also included a very good sales of the quarter, so we had some of the loss of inventory point-to-point capital that we have raised in the past quarter, up by 1422.23 thousand. Compared to a significant growth in the third quarter or the previous year, this quarter, this quarter also brought us back to 32.57%.

The net profit of this month is a portion of the net profit of 14809 thousand yuan, which grew by 43.91% in the quarter, which grew by 91.87% in the year. The revenue of the quarter, our economic rate reached 17.85 percentage points, which grew by 3.56 percentage points in the quarter, and 5.22 percentage points in the year. In the fourth quarter, the amount of revenue was 3946 thousand yuan, and I also pulled this relatively large part out of the exchange profit, that is, the portion of the exchange profit and loss, in the fourth quarter, we generally recognized the exchange profit of 2130 million yuan.

The net interest rate was 14. 9%, which grew by 1.41 percentage points in that quarter, and 4.89 percentage points in that quarter. One EPS in that quarter was $2.4, which grew by 26.9% compared to $2.89 in the third quarter, which grew by 106. 9% compared to the same period of the previous year. Our EPS was $9.21 in 2024. The biggest portion of our revenue was in gearboxes, especially in November and December because the US election was after the new president, Mr. Trump, because there was a tariff issue.

So you can see the fourth quarter clearly this gearbox proportion, a relatively large increase, from 38. 48%. And that is another part of the balance sheet and an important financial indicator, we last year's cash, about 71. 51, and there are some parts of the deposit at the end of the year there are about 300 million, so the deposit plus cash plus deposit, about 10.71 of the level, so the whole cash position is quite good.

That's another part of the entire asset, we came to 3.88826 million yuan, which is also a significant increase compared to the previous quarter keeping up with a year. That's the part of the current debt, which remains at about $89 billion. If you look at it, the loan we really interest at the end of last year is already very low, and there is probably only one loan with Shanghai Commercial Bank and there is a $20 million, so our bank borrowing is quite low. So the whole company's overall financial structure is quite sound, and there is not much debt.

The average number of days of receipt is 94 days, the number of days sold is 111 days, and the liquidity ratio is 3. 14 times. It can be clearly seen that the whole quarter is almost the same, but it is also evident that there has been a significant rebound from the 23rd year of operation. This is a report of the last quarter's operating results.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim texts and convert them into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

First of all, I will check through the sentences to make sure that there are no missing sentences. Then, according to the context, the relevant sentences are grouped into natural paragraphs. For example, the sections on last year's budget and this year's growth goals can be combined into one paragraph, discussing the sections of tariff impact can be combined into another paragraph, and the section on capacity distribution and Vietnam plant expansion can be separated. It is important to note that the user mentioned "permanently closed verb" may mean that each entry is separate sentences, but in fact, it may be necessary to connect them semanticly at the conversion. For example, timestamps may not be required to be displayed in the final paragraph, but the user's example retains timestamps may need to be retained, but the user may wish to remove the timestamps and retain only the content.

In addition, in the example provided by the user, the paragraph verbatim after the conversion does not have timestamps and only retains the content. Therefore, I need to confirm whether the timestamp needs to be removed. Based on the example provided by the user, they may want to remove the timestamp and only retain the sentence content. For example, in the example provided by the user, the original entry has timestamp, but the converted paragraph does not, so this needs to be handled. Now, I need to extract the content from each entry, remove the timestamp, and then organize the paragraph according to the logical relationship.

In the process of processing, make sure that no additional content is added and no sentences are deleted. At the same time, be aware of the coherence between sentences, and may need to adjust the order of sentences, but must remain unchanged. For example, some sentences may belong to the same topic, need to be merged into the same paragraph, while sentences of different topics are handled separately. Finally, check if the converted paragraphs meet the requirements of the user, that is, not deleting anything, keeping the order and integrity of the original word.

If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but according to the user-provided example, it should be handled correctly. </think> [paragraph transcription]: I'm here to explain it first and then ask the general manager to add it here. This is supposed to be our outlook for this year, last year in our internal budget, it would have been for our final major products, including ring tool electric tools, this one, about 10 to 15%, and then we'd have a growth.

But I'm also concerned that the last year has been a bit of a pre-loaded part, whether it's likely that this year is the year if the final demand for the entire guest is not increased, or if the demand is not increased, it's probably because you're going to be affected this year. So this seems to be not clear after the second quarter, but frankly, because the entire international situation is relatively large.

That is, in the fourth quarter of this year, we have received, including the first half of this year may be scheduled to expect shipping of this piece, in this way to estimate that as long as the second half of the year is not too poor, the annual revenue growth of more than 20% of the revenue should be possible to achieve a high probability of growth.

This year, at the end of the year, this big customer predicted that we had not been able to pull the goods in advance, and he said that there were 15 to 18 percent of the growth. What is the impact of the early pull? Let's go to actuarial it, probably the RMB 25 million, which affected the growth rate of this year should be between 3 and 4. That's an inference, should be the case for this data, coupled with the ups and downs of the previous part of the tax duty, the customer has also been ready to pull the goods early, but the truth is not all out, because they are looking forward.

But what if China is taxed and Mexico is not taxed? It doesn't have much impact on our customers. If China is taxed and Mexico is taxed, then Vietnam is not taxed, and it is another plan for our customers. But anyway, it is positive for our company.

In the past year, Zhuhai accounted for about 80% of our total proportion, while Vietnam accounted for about 20%. Especially since the Vietnam factory accounted for a little bit more, but since most of the pre-loaded goods in December 11 was produced from the side of Zhuhai, this piece was later 11 December and the Zhuhai production was slightly increased slightly, which accounted for about 80% of the year. That looks like this year's part, because some of the new projects of our customers are mostly developed in Vietnam, and then mass production, so it can be seen that the proportion will gradually increase.

That's because the total land we bought in Vietnam was over 44600 square meters, and now the first phase of the build started when we started 20 years ago, and it was completed at the end of the 21st century, and 22 years together mass production. After that more than three years, the capacity was gradually close to full load, so the guest also actively digged. Then we also had guests from Japan and Europe, and in fact, all of them went to our Vietnam plant to complete production, which is what we wanted to do in January, and we have been actively expanding the plant here, and also meeting a growing demand for our future orders.

I would like to point out that the main customer of our clients was that he moved from China to Vietnam, which was a plan, and that many of the major European and Japanese brand customers reported by the Chief Financial Officer also started the operation of the factory in the fourth quarter of the 24th and the first quarter of the 25th year of the year, so that the capacity of that Vietnam was the output of Vietnam.

This promotion is according to this original plan. According to this. According to our plan. The original largest customer. He is that 23 years. It is Vietnam 10%. China 90%.

That's it. Then it's 24 years. It's 20% of Vietnam. That's China. That's Mexico. That's 80%.

That's also true. That's going to be 25 years later. Then 25 years later his plan. It's Vietnam 35%. China 35%. Mexico 30%.

What is the meaning of the verse, "If I am a Muslim, I am a Muslim; but if I am a Muslim, I am a Muslim; and if I am a Muslim, I am a Muslim."

Then it goes to Vietnam. That's okay for that tax to be accepted. That's probably the proportion of China. But it's still in Mexico. But whatever it is, it's in accordance with our plan.

This is based on our calculations, so the plan is co-operated. The one that started the Vietnam factory. This construction and production is also happening as scheduled. But this number is stored in Beijing.

Yes. The third earned Hong Kong to New Beijing. So take this first. Now I do this. My heart is uncivilized. The gland separer in the hospital.

This is a steering gear set for the robotic arm used by the guest. This one of our clients is about ten kilograms of low load. Then it is loaded to a high load. The high load can range from 250 kilograms to 1100 kilograms. The gear shown here is the one used for the robotic arm with high load.

Three sets of six such gears. We gave him both the low load load and the high load. The other is the gas degassing gear for the robotic arm. The main is the gas degassing gear for the robot that was given to a guest. The other part is us.

Your own slash reducer includes. A slash reducer for collaborative robots. A slash reducer for this 69 arm. The slash reducer is actually the main component of these parts.

These three parts are the most expensive. The addition of these three parts accounts for more than 50% of the cost. The addition of these three parts accounts for more than 50% of the cost.

Our own self-made rate is about 65%. The other 35% is outsourced or outsourced production. So we have to make our own proportions higher. That's probably a simple introduction.

Our Venus is actually a robot gear and italic reducer. And there are actually lots of shipments. And I'll tell you more. This high and low load is what I just said. This is called a six-axis handling robot.

The main customers have also been with you a few times. We have four families in this robotic group. We have entered into two of them. These products are mainly in that.

One is called Civic Tech. It is a heavy load. One is Full Tech. It is a medium heavy load. One is Queen Tech. It is a medium heavy load.

We currently have a revenue share. Over 50% is Queen Tech. That's it. It's a medium-sized load. That's what this development follows in the next six months in 2025. It's the only one that needs to grow from this order and the project that was developed in August last year.

So we have this product for the future in this robot. ah. From 5% of 23 years to 6.7 of the reports that have been achieved in 24 years. we are very optimistic that it is necessary to reach the goal at 8%. We also set a goal of this 9 to 10%.

Because we have come from. Four years ago we started to send samples to more than 4 customers of human robots. Among them, the human robots have one of our input and timing points. This may be explained by the Chief Financial Officer. Because of the entire project, he is here with permission.

All of them had been there before, and they had been there for a long time, but we were not there for the first time.

The day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near, and the day of the Lord is near.

The second question is because of the robot-related meaning, is to look at the speed of the sand, the effect of the next on the beach, the use of the items and effects of the characteristics, are to talk about, then you will think that this will not be better for the trade, maybe I see is that the principle of what is not the quality, but there is a way, the robot here is relatively high, then you will say this trade, because the fourth quarter also changes in the trade, there is a direction, there is a robot in this direction, there is a lot of it, there is a lot of production, because it is a lot of back-to-end equipment, because it is more expensive, that the cost of depreciation is relatively high, then if it says it, the month or the second season, there is a relatively different, the size of the goods, then the size of the shipment, that we see, this, this is not a lot of the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the Q4. 7, in the first quarter, the growth part seems to be part of the gear will grow, then the slash part should grow, that, but the grinding part is almost the same, may be about 10 pings, so this may be a percentage of the current may look a little higher than the fourth quarter.

This is not the case, because there may be flash gears, straight gears, powder eyes, gears in my power tools. It is a different product because of its processing process or what is very different, so we generally analyze our internal analysis of the network machine use different products. For example, the flash gear, how much straight gear is about, so you say flash gear, because we are made a customized product, so the size of each gear processing is different, so the cost is different, and the competition is also different, so the profit that we can grasp at the time of the report will be different.

If you are looking at our annual report or the notes after the financial report, it is likely that you are going to see more than 80% of the Asian region, but because it is directly from us, it is not this one, you should ask the Chinese side, right. The middle end is, I sell to the customer, because many of our customers may be buying in Asia, but its market is in Europe, Europe, Europe, Asia, or the United States, so it is likely that we are going to sell to the United States.

That is, it must be said. Compared to some of our competitors in China, especially some of the competitors in China, we in Vietnam factory actually started in 19 years. That's the starting salary, in fact, 18 years. The US-China currency war began.

That guest wanted him to be able to work with their main suppliers to set up their factory in Vietnam or even Mexico. In fact, we were also consulted whether or not to go to Mexico, then we set up to Vietnam. We were, at that time, the management team at that time decided that it was not a choice, and you had to go to Vietnam.

It's really hard to set up a multi-national factory, including language problems, and there are a lot of first-time suppliers in Vietnam because of the local, you already enjoy the kind of industry in mainland China. There are some of your suppliers around, or if you have a mold bad, you can quickly repair it, and you can do it tomorrow. Vietnam has no, many places to look for this, and there is no, it has become a lot of things to develop, or in the beginning of a lot of things to enter from the mainland.

I have to say that the military will have these, that is, we are the fastest, the most flexible. We decided to go to the first quarter of 19th, we saw the land first signed a memorandum agreement with our parent company, and then in May 20th, we set up a formal land purchase with our Vietnam subsidiary. That process, because Vietnam is a communist country, he is not buying land, he is long-term lease, and then in the third quarter of 20th, we started to start working. Then in the third quarter of 21st year to complete, but because the third quarter due to the pandemic, the factory was completed, and then put into production immediately.

So, to be honest, the second half of 23 years later, it was slowly rebounded to a relatively large, significant growth in 24 years. So I have to say that compared to some of the counterparts who supply other continents, they were too late, at least two years before they decided to go to Vietnam, and that's how we decided to go out quickly.

In China, most of his production capacity was reduced to China, and was then promoted by China, including new issues that might include tariffs, including the so-called risk. You can now see that tariffs are the issue, so it is difficult to guarantee the day, in addition to the possible other issues that may exist below tariffs. So it is that the customer is also seeing the strength and flexibility of building a supply chain system. So I think that in this sense, the core of the military is to advance, and we need to serve these international brand customers is to do this.
