We also have an office in Thailand this month. That hope is close to serving the entire industry in PCB or Subject. There is an area to develop there. We hope to serve a local customer as well. The global presence in Q4 last year did not increase.

Since last year in October 2020, we established a subsidiary company in Korea. It was a point outside of Dallas in July. In the establishment of a subsidiary company in Korea. I believe in the words of 2025.

Whether it is in Europe or in Southeast Asia, for example here in India, it may be considered a setting of this site. So I think if we have an actual action, we will next time.

Next time, there will be a report of that rule. That last year Q4 was actually there. This is what happened last December. We participated in a life control in Japan. At that time.

This is about a six-unit deployment. It's just us. It's a petrol product. We're trying it.

In that sign attached to the industry. A wide range of equipment. Hope it is used in this. This is called the third generation of semiconductors. Some packaging equipment in Power device.

It also has some trial program equipment in Taiwan. Including red plastic. Or, we also want to put that. Some of the projections. Can go field can actually bring it to a market in Japan.

There is also one of our own construction. It is part of people's science and technology. It can be part of a party. That looks forward to this year. We have a few more important next year. A meeting related to semiconductors.

We'll probably have this month's calendar, like this month's calendar. The Semi-Con China from March 26th to 28th. That's until May this year. This Semi-Con in Singapore. South East Asia is on the Singapore Convention.

In September, there will be the Semi-Con Taiwan. In October, it will be in Phoenix America. The theme of Binx. There is also the Semi-Con West. It is the same as seeing it in December. In fact, Semi-Con followed us to this book.

This is the story, so it should be. It should be. There is a big participation. It was a winner in 2020, so you can see that our company is actually positive.

This development of corporate social responsibility to ESG. So you can see. And then you get a bonus. Everyone wants us to be on it. That is to see that we are on it. The efforts have been affirmed.

The company's outlook is in three parts. It is part of high-tech green energy and big health. I think the high-tech part. There is no doubt in the whole level of an AI and HPC need. In fact, it will grow.

This wafer foundry follows a limited process requirement. Still good. The entire CoreBus supply chain continues to grow. So I think this will bring us one more opportunity to continue to grow. That's another point.

You can see the entire supply chain. That's one of the global supply chains. This dispersion and transfer. So we also see that we are talking about it. Parts are either in Japan or in the United States. A part of Southeast Asia is actually here.

We all got a good one. Some good business results. That's what we're going to do this year too. For example, like I just mentioned, we'll be in Europe or Southeast Asia.

Continue to expand one of our operations. That's the third time. In high tech we also want to follow. The subjects jointly develop a new product. Then there is the integration of semiconductor Chinese equipment. This place to serve.

The green energy is here. Of course, the electronic factory continues to develop. So this is now in Southeast Asia, or overseas. In fact, it is a kind of love. It is a source of revenue growth.

We also want to say in the past efforts. For example, this is a processing business of the object. The business of the circular station utilization. This can also continue to improve. And then increase one more operational performance. There is also a recent AI boom.

We also want to say this. These past experiences and capabilities can be expanded into a building in this data center. Then as a whole solution provider. That's part of the big health. Continue to do.

It can be seen whether we are here. The food. Or the expansion of some stores. These things are still in progress. **Note: **Note:**

**NOTE: **NOTE:**.

This is the policy of a country in China, so I think the biggest response is probably that it is now domesticized in gold, which is supposed to be called the NPC, the polishing chip. There will be a huge amount that will be replaced by the mainland's domestic product. The biggest customers like Yangtze River storage, so now there are about 45,5 million pieces a month to use this domesticated chip.

In fact, these chip manufacturers are due to national subsidies, coupled with their mass production, so members should know that their entire suppliers have four suppliers, including freshmen, Yishiwei, Central, SMIC. They are all lost year by year, and are still losing money by 2024, because they will drop prices, which is lower than their costs, and they still want to lower prices. The main reason is that the country has subsidies. But this subsidies will stop until this year. So let's take a look later.

I think because of China's policy, the country's nationalization, so the current proportion of their requirements is to reach 50% by 2025, that is, the use of domesticization, and 50% can be introduced from overseas. The future will increase to 70%, 30%, this is probably the mature part of 2026, 2027. Basically, silicon wafers also have subsidies, so this will move towards the localization where most of the widely used. But in the advanced manufacturing part, China's silicon is actually compared to the more famous overseas such as Simez, SIMACO, CITRONIC, there are still some differences in the technology of yield.

I would like to ask you about the transformation of optical significance, and I would like to think that the need for advanced production is very strong, and that the transformation of optical significance this year is a positive development, which, in terms of mature production, there are many new factories in mainland China to develop a continuous demand for optical properties. It is not very different from microphotography, it is actually a complex formula of this formula it has a lot of raw materials to add to the technology. China's domestic production has always wanted to follow, but in fact, it has encountered a lot of problems.

So, China's domesticization has not been able to break through, including in the KRF part. Please check whether the progress of the sound factory has begun mass production homework, I think because the new factory's PCR certification is supposed to be 8 to 12 months, but in fact, the customer in order to strengthen the PCR has always asked us to supply as soon as possible, so our well-being plant should be able to start supply in February this year.

So in Southeast Asia, we have a very big case in Singapore. You should also know that this is not the case, it is the world advanced, which in Vietnam we have received three environmental protection periods and this time the depth. We have all received home on hand. As for the part of Taiwan, in fact, we have maintained almost all the orders on hand about about $400,450 million. So adding up that we are planning to complete this year should reach almost our established goal over.

In 2025, we were very optimistic about our operations, and I think everyone can see the direction of our operations in terms of semiconductors. In addition to some advanced technologies and advanced process development related materials, HBM and COWAS have provided the relevant materials for some of these advanced packages.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided. It looks like a record of a meeting or speech, including multiple topics such as company layout, environmental engineering, U.S. investment, etc. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences.

For example, sentences about composite materials and overseas layouts may belong to the same paragraph. Then, I will sort these sentences in logical order and merge them into natural smooth paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may have an interval between timestamps, but the content is continuous and need to be connected correctly. In the process, I need to make sure that no sentences are missing and that each sentence is in the correct order.

For example, the user mentioned that "comprehensive materials have signed an electric coin" and "and underfield and Inpint" are obviously the beginning of the same paragraph and should be merged together. Similarly, on the environmental engineering part, multiple sentences describe different items and need to be integrated into a coherent paragraph. In addition, pay attention to whether the interval between timestamps affects the consistency of the sentence. For example, some sentences have a long interval, but the content may belong to the same topic, and need to determine whether or not to merge. For example, questions and answers about TSMC's expansion of the US trunk program may need to be divided into different paragraphs, but maintain the corresponding relationship between the question and the answer.

For example, the use of "in addition", "at the same time" and other connection words to bridge different sentences, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so you can only use the connection words in the original sentences or keep the original structure. Finally, I will read the entire converted paragraph verbicated text to check if all the original sentences are correctly contained, without omissions or errors. Make sure that each paragraph is logically clear, content is coherent, while retaining the original information completely. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to re-check the timestamps and contents to ensure the correctness. In summary, the process requires careful analysis and patience of the organization to ensure that the dispersed sentences are integrated into easy-read paragraphs without changing the original intent. At the same time, users must strictly follow the requirements, not delete or rewrite any content, keeping the integrity of the text.

Mr. Trump's view on Taiwan's chip is that the company's purpose is to make America, to make advanced technology, and we can also observe that the entire manufacturing supply chain is all as this area is moving, that advanced investment in the US tariff war is an irreversible road, so we continue to tighten this step in the United States, strengthen the function of this service, so we set up this small baby test, you should not look at it, and also spend a lot of money, especially 3D this detection problem, and we have to fight why we will set up our office in Texas is also the president of their semiconductors, and the president of the AI data center in the future, I think we are also continue to be the top runners in the United States.
