<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I will check the transcription content provided.

It is important to note that some entries may belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph and need to be grouped reasonably. First, I will read them in a row to identify which entries can be merged into paragraphs. For example, about combining net values, growth percentages, capital city adequacy, etc. may belong to the same paragraph.

In addition, some articles may involve different subsidiaries or departments, which need to be handled separately to ensure that each paragraph has a clear theme. It is also important to pay attention to the accuracy of the numbers and percentages to ensure that the data in the converted paragraphs is accurate and accurate. For example, data such as "Reduce 0.83 percentage points" and "Growing 5. 69%" must be retained in its original form and cannot be changed.

At the same time, it again confirms the accuracy of all the data and terms to ensure that the user's requirements are met.

From the perspective of the bank, which of the following measures is most likely to help banks expand their high-asset management business? Third, what is the outlook for treasury fees income this year? Thank you for asking the question.

Thank you for the media's question.

In the future, the view of the housing market, in the 113-year period, the number of sales and purchases of goods increased about 35.05 million, about 14.33, however, as the housing market's control policy continues to develop, the current housing market has a strong outlook, and under the situation of the rise of the bad housing market, the control of the housing market in the second quarter should be relatively pessimistic. However, since from 2021, due to the large push of the builders, it will enter the market this year, so there is no amount of energy, but because the banks continue to pay taxes on mortgages, coupled with a one-click increase, the cost of the space on the housing market is really limited, so the second quarter housing market is expected to present the whole situation.

In the past, some of our high-asset clients may have some 60% of their assets outside of the country, and there are only 40% of them in the country, and with these years of tariffs and trade wars, I thought that Taiwanese merchants are going to go back and forth, and SMEs are going to pass on their assets, which is our greatest opportunity.

In addition, in the insurance, we will stay at home in the storage guarantee section, and because of the dividend guarantee part, the guarantee still has family protection and financial capital characteristics, so it will attract the tri-national ethnic groups to make a purchase. That will also be in the context of the Union announced last year that the information cycle, the insurance company.

He has also gradually increased the declared interest rate of the convenience guarantee. That is why we will also focus on these relevant content. That also introduced some incentives. That led to the promotion of the official venue. Thank you.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided verbatim fragments to see if there are any obvious formatting issues or areas that require special attention. For example, if the format of the timestamp is uniform, whether there are duplicated or incorrect content.

Then, I need to reorganize the sequentially cut sentences into consecutive paragraphs. This requires identifying the natural pauses, such as when a person starts talking to another person after completing a complete meaning, or when the same person continues to discuss the same topic. For example, a part of the recruitment program may require the merging of relevant sentences into paragraphs, while the part of the green bond may be another paragraph.

For example, in the question section, the user repeatedly repeats the question, "What are the goals for the operation of the subsidiary this year", which may be due to speech recognition errors, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so all the duplicate sentences must be kept. During the process, also pay attention to the logical connection between the sentences to ensure that the paragraphs are smooth. For example, when a person begins to answer a question, it may be necessary to combine the relevant answer sentences, and the question and answer are separated by line.

Finally, check for missing sentences or formatting errors to ensure that all content is properly converted and in line with user requirements. Especially the last part of non-Chinese content, it is necessary to check whether all the contents are preserved, and how to handle those parts, it may be necessary to keep the original, but to ensure that the structure of the paragraphs is not damaged. In summary, the steps include: understanding user needs, checking the original content, identifying the paragraph structure, consolidating the relevant sentences, processing timestamps and formatting, ensuring that the content is intact and final proofreading.

That is, if the local branch is involved in the target, it is also possible to pay attention to the individual risks of the industry. That is because the large-scale enterprises before he passed a few years of expansion, so the strength of his accumulated strength in the financial part of the robustness, which can also be trusted.

For the financial industry, this recruitment is an example, mainly based on the work experience and class fees different salary treatment, where the elite reserve cadres have this fee, which is the first time we set up this year, the financial conditions are quite advantageous, then if the monthly salary, if the compensation, the month salary is up to 62,400, and if the performance is excellent, it is expected to be promoted to the domestic, so it is quite advantageous of this category. The other GA its monthly salary is also about 53,200, the general financial staff about $39,800, other financial industries, such as lines or foreign exchange, or financial personnel and information personnel, etc., its monthly salary is about 44,600 to 60,800.
