<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a clear segmentation or topic conversion. The transcription has a lot of timestamps, each timestamp corresponds to a sentence. My task is to rearrange these sentences into naturally smooth paragraphs while maintaining the order and content of each sentence. Next, I need to identify the topic of each paragraph. For example, the beginning part is thanks to the guest and introduction of the process, the next is the financial manager's report, then the specific data about the financial situation, and finally the discussion of the business section.

In the process, I pay attention to the connection between sentences to ensure that the sentences in paragraphs are logically coherent. For example, the financial part of the data report may need to combine the relevant sentences together, such as revenue, net profit, balance sheet, etc. The business part involves carbon reduction measures from Guantian plant and private power plant, which should be discussed in detail. At the same time, I need to check if there are duplicate or redundant content, but I cannot delete any sentences according to the user's request, so even if there are duplicates, it must be retained. For example, there may be multiple sentences about carbon and carbon reduction measures that need to be grouped reasonably.

However, the example of the user has been removed from the timestamp, so it may only be necessary to process the text part. During the conversion process, I will read it one by one and combine the relevant sentences into paragraphs. For example, the financial manager's initial white and subsequent financial data reports can form a paragraph, while the business part of the discussion is divided into different paragraphs of the Kanda plant and private power plant.

At the same time, check for formatting errors or punctuation issues to ensure compliance with user requirements. In summary, my steps are: 1. Understanding user needs; 2. Analyzing the transcription structure; 3. Identifying the subject and segmentation; 4. Reorganizing the sentence as paragraphs; 5. Checking the integrity and consistency.

So I also asked our finance manager for last year's financial situation. Let's take a few steps to make a few simple reports. Then, after he reports, I'm going to focus on the company's current business more important. Some important developments tell you a little bit. I'm going to ask our finance manager for last year's financial situation first. Let's make a report with you.

Hello everyone. The following is a brief explanation of the company's recent financial situation. The company's 113-year consolidated revenue is approximately 91.3 billion. That's 112-year 2.8 billion.

The increase is about 38.500 million. That is basically the project revenue. Because of the increase in the progress of the resilient, the project resilience revenue is relatively high.

The project revenue will also increase. In addition to its own Kanda factory. That is more than 112 years of profit. Improvements. So you can see 113 years of business effort. Currently, it is about 4.3.6 billion.

That's the year-on-year ratio. It's already turned that loss to zero. But in this aspect of out-of-office revenue. That's about 9.8 billion years. That's about 3.3 billion years less than 112 years. That's basically the IP we're investing in.

They are the ones who have lost their souls, and they are the ones who have lost their souls, and they are the ones who have lost their souls, and they are the ones who have lost their souls, and we are the ones who have lost their souls.

It is estimated that about 13,500 million. That's about 90,97 billion in return for 112 years. That's about 1.8 billion per share. That's in the balance sheet section. As you can see, the main reason for the change is in liquidity.

The current assets are about 80 billion. That's the same as last year's 58.3 billion. The amount of change is relatively high. That's mainly because of the increase in operating income. So the income of the project increases. So the corresponding contract asset projects.

Its amount is relatively high. The other change is relatively large. It is. In the case of current liabilities. This is also related to the increase in operating costs of operating revenue. So it corresponds.

The subject of debt is, of course, the corresponding increase in compliance with engineering law. But it also includes what we can compare with. It accounts for 1.9 billion companies. That's because it expires in August this year. That's why it moves from non-current liabilities to current liabilities.

There is also a difference of about $19 billion here. So here is the current debt. It is also a significant increase. Of course, the relative non-current debt is also a relative decrease. The current company's debt ratio is about 43.6%. The financial structure is rising and stable.

That's in the case of cash flow. Business activities in addition to some cash received from our business. In addition to the cashback we receive. That's the main thing.

The cash reduction in the 113-year period is about 0.9 billion. The current cash on that account is 18.43 million. The current cash is up 100 million. That is, if we look at the revenue in February this year.

That difference is. Mainly or engineering. The progress of the fissure income. Next, look at the five-year toll of our fissures. That, in addition to the 113-year part of the distribution, there are dividends. The other year is the discovery of the gold toll.

Gross margin. Maintained above 4.5%. 113-year margin. Expected to be a distribution of $2.1 per share for cash of $2.1. Above is the financial position of the company for 113 years. Good above is an overview of the company's finances.

Last year was 113 years of the company's revenue. Or the net profit after tax. They all paid a good report. That. The part of the dividend cash dividends should also create a new high in the year. That is also for us.

Shareholders also have an answer to that, of course, thank you. Thank you all for your support. Next, I will focus on the important business of the company. A simple report with you is because we are now. It should be said that there is this charge every season.

All in all. The business situation should not change too much in every season, so I focus on it. The relatively large part of the change, that is to do a description with your friends. That's the part where I don't change.

I may have skipped him. It was the first part of the Kanda factory. Of course, we all know that the current government is.

Drive this carbon reduction. And of course, this year, we will also start to charge it from the beginning of next year. Carbon costs. So, of course, to reduce the cost of carbon, we will also meet the government's carbon reduction needs, or the international demand for carbon reduction.

So apart from the increase. Kanada factory film followed. SRF usage in addition to. We will go further. We will start this year.

You can't use this. Wood pellets. Or other reproductive properties. The current part of this wood pellets is in the process of trying to burn.

If that's possible, we'll start trying to use this wood pellet as our tool. For our alternative fuel. Of course. As a result. The entire international carbon reduction trend. Including net zero may be net zero by 2050.

This is one of the goals of carbon reduction, so the future is, so the portion of coal can be used for a long time, and we do not have enough certainty.

In response to such a trend. Kanada Plant is also thinking. In the medium to long-term. Whether it should come to this wood pellet tool for the purpose of carbon reduction. So we are now changing gas. To further reduce our carbon emissions.

That part is still under study. That is the part of Kaneda which is next to the private power plant. Of course, the private power plant part is not only good maintenance of the unit. That is. Our power system can be accepted when needed.

It's about carbon reduction. So the future is up to us. This is now or is now in the lid. Prepare the unit to be lid. Or should it be.

Mix. Or use. Do the technology, etc. We are still in the process of keeping an eye on it. There is also another important issue in the IPP section. We are working with new electricity.

The PPA expires in about four years. The new round is about nine years long. So the time is not too long, so the company is also discussed here. These IPPs expire after the expiration.

What is the best way to do it? (i.e., to extend the contract, to extend the life of the unit, or to do something better)

In the case of corporate governance and sustainability at all levels of the court, there is no new progress, if any, that will follow you with advanced reports. In the case of corporate governance and sustainability as before, in the case of corporate governance and sustainability as we have in the case of TCSA, we have achieved good results, including a hundred gold medals for sustainable power and reporting. In the case of temperature discs or car body checks, we have completed the 113-year inventory and are currently conducting third-party verifications.

The second phase of Guoguang Phase II is a good news that the part of Guoguang Phase II was acquired by Taipower to purchase electricity in 117 February, which was signed with our contractor on February 19, this year. The part of the project contract is the same as that of our Wolshu Phase II and Taipower Offshore Phase II. As many advanced friends know, there are three projects in the investment and development process, including the hamburger, Changhua, and Miaoli. It is easy to report that the portion of the hamburger wind is now allowed to use the land of five wind turbines, and then continue to carry on some of the construction applications.

This is part of the wind power. There are currently two cases of photovoltaic. The first one is this Hamali's Changhua Yongxing Rain Electric Co., Ltd., and the local competent authority is currently working on a letter of approval.

At the end of last month's renewable energy business, the green electricity that has accumulated more than 67 billion degrees at the end of last month has been more than 67 billion degrees, so we are 100% invested in TSMC Green can do such a service. In addition, TSMC Green Energy also participates in various business such as power education platforms to provide ancillary services, and is currently actively fighting for related business.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
