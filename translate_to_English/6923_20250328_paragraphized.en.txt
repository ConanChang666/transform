We have heard from you, and you have heard from us, and you have come to us, and you have come to us, and we have come to you, and you have come to us, and we have come to you, and you have come to us, and we have come to you, and you have come to us.

Thank you, my fellows, for listening to you all. Thank you for the year. Join us at the Falun Gong Party in Taichung. Today we will be divided into five parts.

One is about, some skills introduced, some industry reform, and some solutions.

In the end, we will talk about the financial part, and the future. We will go now. We will help you in the brief meeting. The competition to our table at the same time.

That's part of our center. We're a company that's been established for more than 20 years. Our vision is to use the afterbirth. It's a concept of a nearby company. It's capable of developing the industrialization of raw materials.

And to be able to develop various solutions. To be an industry supply chain. Below is our company solution. And so we will get some reports later.

One of the missions of our company is innovation and technology to create economic add-on resources. Sustainable concept. Constant development. From the circular economy to the sustainable environment. Mr. Cheng Kwong Kit, our director.

He is one of the founders of our company. He is currently our capital. He is back more than 90 million people. At present, there are 1.90 working people. He also became a listed company last year.

The company is 692 million. That is to say, our history. We created 20 as early as possible. 2001 and 2002. Started from the manufacture of specialized. Recycling began.

Then slowly began in 2008. He went to Huabao Science Park. At that time, he invited some of Huabao's vendors to enter. We were also the first to enter. There was a Huabao processing plant in Taoyuan. That time passed.

We also made a lot of expansion with our humbleness. Until 2014, we also built another factory. This is mainly recycled by PCB. That's until 2019.

At that time, we saw the need to be treated by the road. The more we get, the more we get. So we started to bring us together. The founding of China's intelligent circular machine Media Center. We were a simple layer of China. That was three years ago.

We also came to the town of Permits. It is now full. In 2002, we returned to 2004. It started here. It is in the structure of the organization. In fact, it is not very different from the general listed fee company.

But we are focused on our environmental treatment industry. Focused projects, such as occupational safety, cybersecurity, and circular economy as well as innovative R&D. The purpose of our work.

Special independent point of view. Let us come from the jurisdiction of the manager profession. Promote our business efficiency. We currently have three processing plants in China. It is in the processing plant of Taoyuan Branch.

These three processing plants are very close to each other. They are within 500 meters of each other. They can support each other. We work together to maximize efficiency. That's what we can see.

We are one of the three factories in China. And now we have the latest environmental remediation works. The most senior factory is to see the China in the lower left corner. It was started in 2008.

That's another part of the 60's. Our three factories are still in the top three. They are mainly recycled by PCB tubes. This one is a model of a fully recycled processing deployment. It's just mentioned three years ago.

That is the appearance of a water model. In the relationship there. We are now more culturally-oriented aircraft road treatment center. At present, our market share. If focus is a problem with the New Sea World aircraft road. Our culture is still 30%.

We also have the field of environmental remediation projects. Slowly is the ability to make our factory. The technology of the second factory three factory. Can be implemented. To make more contributions to the environment.

And they shall see it, and they shall see it, and they shall see it, and they shall see it, and they shall see it, and we shall see it, and they shall see it, and we shall see it.

We are the ones who have the most wisdom, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, the ones who have the most power, and the ones who have the most power.

We can handle waste in the high-tech industry. We can handle it properly. We can also supplement some resources. Back in the industrial process. We are a value circulating system of energy resources. That is to say, back in the future.

Our report processing plant. In fact, the most important thing in the Mediterranean is the regulation. Except for the Mediterranean itself. All three of our processing plants have their own Class A. Apart from the fertile muscle processing license. We also have a Class A and New Place License.

And the environmental organization medical certificate. That's another input on the staff. Our staff is only 190 people. But we are above the occupational safety and environmental protection fire. There are 148 professional-grade licenses. That's proof that we're training the staff.

I hope to strengthen the quality of green leaders through these trainings and certifications. That is, in addition to the human rights certificate. In the system above, such as the construction of 200 laboratories.

We are the source of all waste. We are the resource we want to go out in the future. We can handle it. We do the product of these resources. We do the right quality control.

There is also environmental monitoring. The staff of the system is healthy. It is also a africanist field. A rare part of the disaster.

In addition, the system is above. We specifically discussed the KIA safety and health system of ISO 45001, as well as the ISO D4001 environmental management system. From the system surface, it is necessary to be able to pass the system.

And he gave us his inheritance in the midst of them, and his inheritance was in the midst of them, and his inheritance was in the midst of them, and his inheritance was not in the midst of them.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription of the re-routing of the industry. The following are some of the problems that come with some of the wastes that come with the re-routing of these industries. I see that the last week of CommonWealth Magazine or the last week of the week of Haga Longye Show was talking about a lot of color problems. In fact, everyone was slowly aware of the problem of actually wastes.

In addition, if you give us the waste you don't need to take the advantage of the A or B or C 200, we have more than 200 solutions for you. In addition, we are less likely to have a four-page waste management solution in our factory, which is a four-page waste management facility, which is a four-page waste treatment facility that we have in our new four-page waste management facility three years ago, and then we have a comprehensive waste disposal center, which is the largest waste treatment plant in Taiwan in recent years.

In addition, some of the glass fibers we add to the modified agent can become the production of local products, the factory's feature is the whole cycle of the main cool golden gold not only anchor, but the focus is the production of typ in the glass circulation of non-electronic engineering we can not load was a lot less reflect the micro area, and we have a high percentage of the rental of our skilled products to be sent to the center after carbonization can be experienced. In recent years, the Ministry of the environment has some time-consuming cotton nets, it is hoped to speed up the recovery. These time-consuming cotton nets are harmful to the human body.

We are currently developing this set of support. In 2023, we also developed this set of support with basic building materials. We worked with Jemou Technology to mark cases in the Northern District of Kaohsiung. Because 123 places in Taichung have their own thermal operations and some animal control capabilities. So we worked with Jemou Technology to do this project.

In the second half of the year or this year, we will focus on the interests of non-emotional history in Korea or some of the cultural projects that are harmful to precious metals. There is a big watershed here on the financial performance, which is in 2022. Before 2022, we had only two and three shows in 2012, and the revenue that we can contribute to these two sites is about 500 million yuan. Our profits account for about 100 million yuan.

In the past, about 1 billion yuan, about 7 billion yuan in 2022 to 2 billion yuan in 2024. If we restore it to the Ibida part of the perspective, it is the same in Ibida part, before 2021, about 70 million to 80 million yuan. In 2022, the start of investment was about 300,400,8, and until 2024 last year, about 600 million yuan. On the EPS and dividend distribution, this figure can be seen in front of the EPS, no matter the revenue or profit, are shown on the EPS.

In addition to 2020, because of the relationship at the time of construction, we have a relatively large amount of cash, only the distribution is very fast.

From 2019 to 2024, we have deducted the amount of Fali and the volume and the special and calculus, which is probably a cash dividend. All of which were distributed. Last year, our EPS was four hundred dollars, and then our Board of Directors decided in March that it was four hundred dollars per share. As seen above, by 2022, we were building real estate in the middle of the Mediterranean, so the capital expenditure would be slightly higher. After the introduction of the property in 2022, a slight optimization was made, so it was around 1.47. By 2024, if the size of the original factory, capital expenditure was very low, but we now decided to build a second phase project in May, so the capital expenditure would reach 87,000.

A second phase of the project is going to be a preview at the end of the second phase. Our three factories are also growing in size, so the total assets from 200 million to 2.1 billion, to 44 billion today. The share of revenue, about 2022, is only tea shopping malls, we are selling copper powder, and there is a recyclable gas. At that time, about 3 to 7,3 is a product selling copper powder, 7 is an unfavorable sale. Later in 2022, after a formal operation, the revenue of the culture is slowly increasing, so by 2022, our revenue reached 5 percent. By 2023, we began to join the environmental engineering review, so the revenue ratio was slightly changed, and we entered a new environment, possibly up to 16%.

In 2024, due to environmental engineering entering the high level of the period, the proportion of environmental engineering has reached 32%, about 37%, recycling processing about 20%, and then selling Baomen about 15%, so about 3,3,2,1 ratio. Let's look at the core of Chinatai, we use the general base of the three green point, gross profit margin, operating interest rate, and net interest rate. I can see that the first quarter is slightly more, until the third quarter has reached the highest point. The main reason for this is that we, this business, the proportion of Chinatai, culture will be slightly larger, and then the culture because we will do some fixed, relatively large parts, because in 2024 we will, so the number of days will be less, gross profit margin will be reduced, about 24%, but in the third quarter, but in the third quarter, we hardly did not do not do the gross profit rate, so we see the average, we see the average, the average of the year, the average, we see the average, the growth.

In the past, the net worth of the U.S. stocks was about 20 pieces, which, after 2024 last year, after the EU, after the instalment of the funds, our net worth reached 29.3% at the end of 2024, to 29.7%. It has been 30 years since.

First of all, I would like to introduce to Roy the layout of our center. First of all, we have some cooperation with Kennett, there is a lot of investment in the order of science and technology. That is probably the order of science and technology is done, the starter of waste matching platform. Like the environment-friendly Uber Eats, it can go to the technology to match waste, so that the treatment price and efficiency of this waste, as well as the control store are more transparent and convenient.

In addition, Kennett Energy, in this power plant, we have a lot of cooperation in the future because its quality is adjacent to us, and there will be a lot of opportunities for cooperation in the future, that is, it is able to have high performance, ready for people's technology, electricity generation equivalent to more than 25% of a power plant. That is, there are also some long-term power generation, and waste environmental consulting services. In some of our research and development strategies in the center, we have, we have made short-term, medium- and long-term plans for seven major directions.

The center is now using the existing technology to start research and development, and until the market is more suitable, the center will soon start with a construction price. In addition, we also hope that this year the same part can be more targeted, especially at the same price.

This acquisition rate is expected to increase to 1200 tonnes a month. In addition, we are also in deep blue, the pre-construction facility has some planning, which is expected to increase to 7200 tonnes in a month. There is also a resource, not a hindrance, the central strategy, and we also want to be able to do some development in this cycle.

Some of the developments we have been working hard to do, to go to the event, that last year, also released the second edition, orderly report, it cooperates with the orderly development of the United Nations, these are the mainland, all with the Bierwo SDG to echo. The Mediterranean is also a long time ago, invested in environmental education, we also should continue to through, environmental education facilities, certified zero-cost fundamentalism period, by the end of last year, has been close to 79 levels, and then interview the number of people is not enough.

However, while the Mediterranean may not be as large as they are, or as old as they are, we have a lot of different technologies and services, such as being a curing, or having a culture, or having a bias, his experience of banknotes, or having the ability to do such a thing, environmental remediation works, and one experience of recycling metal. The Mediterranean is a small and beautiful cuisine.

We have 148 , vibration, value processing plant, and recycling of resources, and these technologies, we hope to provide customers with a full range of non-material processors. At the same time, we also uphold the concept of a circular economy, we also do a lot of things, such as speed conversions, like these non-materials, cement products, or shopping, or high-purity identical copies.

In 2018, we set up a factory in Taoyuan, the current three plants, the land, more than 13000 square feet, we followed, whether the whole recycling system, or the eradication system, the relationship is very good, but also continuous cultivation, more green materials, in this industry, the deep development of the industry. Finally, to bring you five first, let you remember our position in the middle of the market. We are the first, should be the largest single in Taiwan in recent years, four-leaf waste cyclone power generation facility, which is the only one in the country to deal with waste, this company.

In addition, in terms of traditional recycling, the market share should be close to 90, which is also the first in Taiwan. In addition, our three factories of printed circuit boards, which is currently the largest in the whole recycling industry. Because we have a very good understanding behind the oral, we also have an exclusive team of iron ore, troubling, remediation and environmental engineering.
