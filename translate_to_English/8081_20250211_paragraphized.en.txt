Mr. Wu Jingchuan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors

Next. Please explain the standard. Well, next. This is also a warning for the pipe area. Next. That said, in the fourth quarter of last year, 49.76 million this is something we all know.

The fourth quarter of the last two years is almost the same as the first quarter of that year, and the fourth quarter is almost the same as the first quarter of that year. Then the fourth quarter is the same as the first quarter of that year, and that is probably the rule. Then the fourth quarter is that the gross profit is only about $37, which is part of the product and part of the customer's decline. Although the gross profit value of the first two quarters last year is almost always more than 40, we try to avoid a large price market, but not a lot of money or a little impact.

The EPS in 2023 was 17. 33, so last year the EPS added a little bit more. Well, next page. This product application segment had dropped two percentage points last year, and then computing here is the boss PC received and so on. This increased 3%. Then the TV customer here was the three percentage points that fell, then touched from 6% to 7%, then I thought this place was an increase of one percentage point, and then it didn't change.

It's not a matter of how much AI server needs to be, but it's basically just a matter of not being able to tell at the moment. More is less than a week, the US Google, OpenAI, Meta people are running to tell us what we really are doing? What are we doing? We actually have this model, but we didn't show up before, this assessment can't do anything. Well, the second thing is because we're going to say that Edge computing, because the AIPC and AMD have to be clear here, that the definition of AIPC is that it's the next MPU in its CPU, so it's a PC called AIPC after the plastic network chip.

If you want to buy hardware, the hardware buy you start doubt, because after the second year of your hardware computing power is no longer enough, until the third year of the third year of the more difficult, you do not know what to do. But if you go to the cloud service, you will not be able to pay you, and because you buy your PC models you will not be willing to pay you, and because you buy your own PC models you will be able to put them up for half a day, you will die.

I don't see the need for AI in the industry. I've been working with glasses lately, and the AI glasses are the old ones. I don't think so, so the glasses I've never understood, because I'm not wearing glasses, I'm taking my near-sighted glasses, I'm buying AI glasses, I'm going to go to a 3C shop to buy or go to a optic store.

This is the reason why Trump has come to this industry chain to deal with this, but the U.S. tariffs have not been canceled, so how to adapt to the current industry chain is almost the same thing that some stars are afraid of Taiwan's production of fine goods to add a lot of asset tariffs that the subsequent effect of this matter will continue to look at and then at least for us, whether it is the whole industry is not only for us, but also for the whole Taiwan industry together with us to do the policy, then the TV panel mechanical TV panel, Moyer and Nobu TV panel is not much price, this is the most important thing, or the panel capacity is now or only 70%, and the reason is that they can control more than the mainland last year is not a lot of the market. This is the reason why most of our industry is not competing with them. It is basically the fact that including the experience of manufacturing people also know that the mature experience of manufacturing directly to the mainland company is like the production capacity and force to continue to grow, we should have a way to find the right way to keep growing, so we concluded that all industrial companies should continue to do all the activities and continue to do a few days ago after seeing the interview of TIO, how can I think of that is the January 2024 free car accounted for three percent of the industry accounted for three percent of the remaining five percent of it can not be released, so this is obviously a long-term growth trend.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged in chronological order into paragraphs.

First of all, I will check the provided transcription fragments to see if there are any formatting issues or areas that need special attention. For example, if the format of the timestamp is consistent, whether there are duplicates or missing parts. Among the fragments provided by the user, each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences, which look clear. However, some sentences may have overlap or interval between the timestamps, which need to be checked if they are correct. Next, I need to arrange these transcription entries in chronological order and merge them into consecutive paragraphs. It is important to note that the user requests do not delete anything, so make sure that all the sentences are included while maintaining the original order.

For example, timestamps from 930. 56 to 1354. 56, the corresponding sentences at each point in time need to be arranged in order. During the processing process, you may encounter logical jumps or non-continuous situations between some sentences, but can not be modified or adjusted according to the user's request, only according to the original arrangement. For example, some sentences may be duplicated or incomplete, such as "good", "that", etc., these need to be kept in the same order and cannot be omitted.

In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to some possible spelling errors or formatting problems, such as "NPS ah", "RD that", etc., which may need to be kept as it is, unless the user specifically points out that it needs to be corrected. However, according to the user's requirements, no modifications can be made, so the original content must be retained. During the process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the correct sentence corresponding to each point is correct.

In summary, the process requires careful follow of the user's instructions to maintain the integrity of the original, while also organizing a paragraph by a reasonable context to ensure smoothness and readability without violating any of the rules. </think> The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription based on the fragments you provide (completely retain all content, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed any sentence):.

So, the remaining five percent should be, one is. It is in the search for this plane. The plane of fractures. Special force to fight, so follow NPS.

It's all about money. It's a circle. Well, then it's all about increasing research and development.

He who is in a state of purity and purity, and he who is not in a state of purity and purity, is not easy to find.

Thank you for sharing with the Chairman. We welcome you all to invest in advanced. Open the microphone directly. Ask a question.

Or use our chat room to ask questions. It's best to chat. It's not that way. The text will never be forgotten.

There are other questions. Welcome to use the chat directly to type it out. The chairman will see it here. I will also help you ask a question here. It should not be too long.

It is written twice a year. It is written twice a year. The file is too big to do too long. It is uploaded and passed to death quickly. He has another strange part of it. I don't know that today's working class must be uploaded.

Okay. That chairman of the board has a chat room to start asking questions. That's endless. Unselected. It really has a slight drop in space this year. This should be a new classmate.

We can't talk about the price. It's the top of the news. It's the one who's down, the one who's naturally coming out because of that cover these young people.

We can't talk about it. Then the world's number of capital. Total depreciation. Mainly the use of contract products.

It should be related to the application. Because this demand is less related to the scenery. When the scenery is good, it will not burst. The scenery is not bad and it will not be like that. The reason for this.

Convention. The wages of the machine applied are in fact conservative. Just like when it is out of stock. The factory director rushes into the machine. The workers who make the machine.

This is the reward of those who do good, and the reward of those who do evil is the reward of those who do evil, and the reward of those who do evil is the reward of those who do evil, and the reward of those who do evil is the reward of those who do evil, and the reward of those who do evil is the reward of those who do evil.
