The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: OK. Well, of course. Thank you. Come to our meeting today. Of course, the information we're going to accept next, of course, will be some of our expectations about the market, and the actual numbers will be up to date. We'll be updating regularly on this public information perspective.

If you have new information, you can also do a Deb there. Well, we will visit the Soviet Union later, and we will use a few goals to talk to you about our modern condition. Then of course, the first thing to talk to you about is the whole of our value propositions, especially in this recovery.

And in the end, we can say that our needs and capacity supply are the same. We are also the most supportive of the situation, and we are also mildly characterized by our price structure. So the structure is also very competitive. So this to explain why we are in the market area of the customer, and now we are gradually improving.

It's an absolute number that has gone beyond absolute units. It's still growing. Especially after that, we'll see that in this base, it's more and more related to the spread of advanced assets. Its growth mobilizes as well. The advanced assets in our market are also relatively higher.

But we've been established since 1997. One of our products is that we're living in. That's the main house in Taiwan. Especially Leading. That's what a few numbers of investments share with you. At MarketPay, we're $2.4 billion by the end of 2024.

That's roughly 0.8 billion dollars. Of course, we should have seen the price of yesterday, and now we're more like a billion dollars. That's 30 billion dollars getting closer and closer.

We are buyingGene. Of course we have two main business. One is Lucanweaver and one is LufaSingling. Of course we are leading the technology on Lucanweaver. Especially below 5nm.

Our leadership is obvious. Then again, we are in the bourgeoisie. We are the first to work together to collect the museum. This is a major vendor. Of course, we should have a page to explain it to you. And then, with this customer base, our main customer is the Foundry.

In particular, the Foundry of LufaSingling. There are some T-ones. There is a business in that system. It may have its own right to jump. We are in the other, there are three T-ones, we have a good product. We are one of the growing animals.

Then, of course, it is the whole and then it is not going back. Take a look at what you're looking at here. It's actually why it's called a sustainable product. I have a few points. That's what our products say from a financial point of view. It's good for the customer's process.

Make it a smoother process. And do it at a relatively low cost. So Business is constantly evolving. And for customers, maybe a professional vendor. He can get more benefits on his Cost. In other words, its system is after all a regenerative experience on the environment.

It is, indeed, mature to use. So after that, our technology works better. More and more expenditures are used. In fact, it is also a benefit to the consumption of assets support. Of course, I don't say it.

This product can help customers reduce their costs in their processes. Then it is still the best for the business. Well, we are now using a second facet. Let's take a look at some of the financial performance of the past six quarters.

We look at a few faces. You can see that we show three of the above information. One of them is, of course, the WomenU of the Pillar Land.

Another two are Ghost Margin and Rodin Margin. You can see. In the past our WomenU. There was a lot of rapid production at the same time. In fact, it also represents a rapid increase in our industry. In fact, we usually look at a molecule of rapid capacity expansion.

Its gross interest rate may have basically a negative impact on No Simple Digital. But you see the biochemical semiconductor. We do it while we grow our rounds of revenue. In fact, our WomenU is growing gradually. Of course, this is an important reason. Let's just say we have some numbers to make everyone feel.

But basically I can say it first. This is mainly about saying. Entering the time of 24 years. The second project of WomenU is in the heart of the factory it is two rounds of vigorous development. In fact, the first it has been in the 24 years of the 20 million pieces. It enters its economic scale.

And it came to pass, as we walked through the women's curve, so it was a drop in unit cost, which was a great help.

Another direction is to say that we are expanding the production. So, we made the unfavorable increase in the production capacity of the project. We have made it great. We have also continued to increase in this way. It will increase in this way. Of course, I am not saying that.

But it will have a problem with the exchange rate. But that's a fundamental problem with a branch. In the long run, we'll still see our trends. The module in our entire WomenU continues to rise. Well, that's another point of view.

It is an extreme of our capital. You can see us in the past. In fact, it was through the second quarter of last year. Our Capitalized Entity. In fact, it was a rapid increase. But that's why.

It is a very strong demand, so we don't have a lot of demand for our customers.

And you will see that we have been blessed with two hundred years, and that we have been blessed with two hundred years, and that we have been blessed with two hundred years.

This has a relatively close to more than 80 Percent. We are going to talk about it for a long time. We should keep more than 40 to 50 Percent. The speed of this expansion. But sometimes it will have a reason for Peak. That is, if there are some viewers machines.

It is relatively high price. It is going to be fighting this season. Of course, it will come up with this Peak. That is to say, we want to resist. We will be expanding quickly. But our data.

or in the middle of about 48 to 58. OK. Then we use a few. Fabricio's Metrics to share with you. That's actually a couple of big faces. You can see that we're from last season.

It's the first quarter. We're going to start publishing our company. We're going to have 12-inch microfiber training. You can see Q1 in 25 years. It's either YY or QQ. We can actually see our training.

How much more sustained. Includes the ongoing Q2. This training is also in continuous improvement. So from the point of view of Q2, we are really alone. As the industry expands.

Our number will continue to go up. Of course, this middle contains a number of purposes. Of course, everyone has already entered the information. We have a quick highlight. In fact, everyone can see us. We have been from the last quarter of the 19.9.

Now we have reached 21% in the last quarter. More than 20%. That's what I'd like to tell you. That's what Cashflow is all about. You can see our Full Cashflow.

But this is for the expansion of our form. We want to expand the needs of our customers. So our Full Cashflow. And of course, I will tell you, and we will be negative in the short term.

But it grows with our revenue function. Full Equity's Cashflow comes here. It continues to grow. Full Cashflow also continues to improve. That's because our revenue function increases. But that doesn't mean we don't grow.

We're still growing fast. Of course, we're just saying that our revenue function will be enlarged. Full Cashflow will gradually go in the right direction. OK. That's another thing we'd like to share with you.

The trend of the market also has a whole situation of our competition. In the long run, the market changes, etc. How to go about it. It's easy for us to know the first step. We follow the advanced market to grow. So the advanced market.

In the market semiconductors we follow it. And very direct growth. There are a few of us here. I just said. In the modern process.

Our company is so. We calculate the condition of the five nanometers or less. We calculate the condition of the five nanometers or less. As you can see, our modern process is actually higher than our EU market.

That's what you're talking about. The modern process is about 20,000 years into mass production. There's a problem with the host and I'm the anchor. Because we've all become that proportion. We're going to raise it. What the market looks like.

It's actually one. Especially in terms of quantity. It's a process with a monthly limit number. It's not a high percentage of its usage. We have several numbers for everyone to feel.

There will also be no stop. You will ask how many production opportunities. You will ask more than 80,000 production opportunities. It is likely a ratio of 1 to 0.8. So if we are OK now. At the time of synchronization.

Now we are from twenty-eight nanometers. A diaphragm is in three nanometers. A diaphragm is a diaphragm of tens of thousands at a time. A diaphragm is a diaphragm of tens of thousands at a time. It takes 230,000 times to produce a diaphragm. That is, what the ratio would be.

From very mature 228 nanometers. From small to advanced process of three nanometers. It will become about. Then it will enter two nanometers. As you can see, there will be two nanometers after three nanometers.

We estimate how much the two nanometers will increase. We estimate that we have also given numbers below 68. We believe that this estimate is about 2:7. That is, a segregated piece.

One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tablets need to be numbered again. But from this point of view, this proportion is also aware that we were originally. It should be underestimated. It should be up again. Of course, there are a few reasons.

First. Go from military to G20 mode. Its structure is complex. Then its process countdown is even more. And, of course, most importantly, this complexity increases.

It's possible. The whole customer he needs. If he wants to use it again in the past, the proportion will not increase. This is what we see now.

That is to say, trioxide semiconductors belong to this. The more fiber the process is, the more we grow with it. The more fiber the process is. The higher the percentage of the additional parts required.

The two of us have been given the knowledge of God, and we have been given the knowledge of God, and we have been given the knowledge of God, and we have been given the knowledge of God.

We are the first in line. Of course, we are talking about the so-called cleanness that we see in it. After the cleanness, we are talking about it from two angles: Particle Size.

That is to say, I am above this machine. The higher the particle cleanliness, of course there is another. The length of the segment is also used for cleanliness.

We don't know the particle size. The length of the segment. We are. OK. That's another part.

There are a number of trends in the market as a whole in our competition. In the long run, the market changes and so on.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be retained sentence-by-word while organizing them into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this content mainly discusses the capacity of the two companies, especially the delta semiconductors and Japan's RS Technology. The speakers mentioned quarterly data for 2024 and 2025, as well as plans and challenges for capacity expansion, such as internal volume issues in the Chinese market.

In addition, there is information about the capacity comparison of Hsinchu and Taichung factories, as well as the efficiency improvement. Next, I need to figure out how to segment these sentences. Usually, the paragraphs should start around a topic or sub-theme. For example, the objectives of the capacity of a trioxide semiconductor can be a paragraph, followed by an RS Technology situation, and then a challenge about capacity expansion, and finally a comparison of plant efficiency.

For example, the user mentions that "we now have two numbers in the book", which may be an error or a typographical error, but according to the rules, the original sentence must be retained. Similarly, a combination of numbers like "2640 we have with R24" may require contextual understanding, but it must be retained as a whole. Also, be careful about the processing of timestamps. The verbatim script provided by the user comes with timestamps, but in the final paragraph-version version, the user may want to remove the timestamp, only retain the content.

Therefore, when finishing, I remove the timestamp and keep only the sentence itself. When organizing the paragraphs, I consider the logical relationship between the sentences. For example, the capacity target of trioxide semiconductors and the capacity adjustment of RS Technology may belong to the same topic and can be placed in the same paragraph.

In addition, some sentences may need to be adjusted in order to comply with the logical process, but must ensure that the original intention is not changed. Finally, I will read the finishing paragraph verbatim to check whether the user has all the requirements: no delete anything, maintain the original sentence order, paragraph structure is reasonable, and the language is smooth. At the same time, make sure that no personal interpretation or rewriting is added, completely faithful to the original material. In summary, the process requires careful reading, logical analysis, and strict follow the user instructions to ensure that the final output is both in accordance with the format requirements, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the original content.

We now have two books with numbers. The two companies have numbers. Of course the first one is here is our trioxide semiconductor. Then the second is the RS Technology of Japan, which is currently the production plate. The playback of their respective production capacity. Of course, 2024, this is a fact of the quarter.

In 2025, this is also a quarterly fact. At the time of the high-profile, we expect our capacity to reach 800K at the end of this year, which is 8 million tablets per month, 12 inches. We are now talking about 12 inches. But just as I said, we just mentioned one thing, the temperature of the oxide is higher than our limited TIC.

So we'll tell you, we're going to tell you now, we're going to use the eight million pieces of this goal, if it's the capacity we're going to reach at the end of the year, we should now set up, to reach this goal, to reach eight million pieces every month. That seems to say that the new demand for technology is to help protect the needs of the server. In our current situation, we'll try to supplement some equipment. Of course these devices are still statistics, so we can increase the value in the short term, that is, in the basic basis, how much more it can increase, this we'll calculate, and then we'll go back to update. Well, there's another thing we'll share, when we see that 2640 we's basically the same as R24, most energy we's more than it to 12 million pieces.

But here we have a problem, in fact, it was originally in Japan, it was estimated that it was in Japan, its capacity to reach 770K, which is 77 million pieces. But you will see that here we are using its public information, it has now been modified down to 80K. That is to say, it is different from us, and there is a lot of it to increase the success of China. But China is very good at rolling now, there are some things to overcap the overall situation, so the speed of expansion here also seems to be slow, because it is written above 840K, but this 840K we are not that it needs to add another 100K.

But there's one more important information here, and the first one we're going to use is to open it further. Of course, we're going to do it a little harder. OK, so let's just say a few things, the first one we're going to reach 800K at the end of this year, and we'll reach that goal in the last quarter. Then we'll let our equipment how much more we can come in, and we'll wait to update our new capacity to everyone. Of course, here we'll mention that this life semiconductor we've been almost 1000K in the last few years from 165K to our later. Of course, there's a few information shows for everyone, you can see that there are two colors of Barcha, of course, this grey barcha is our capacity in Hsinchu, and this blue barcha is our capacity in Taichung.

We know that we first heard that because of the gradual increase in production capacity in Taichung, it is highly efficient, and it is cost-effective in the process than in the original Hsinchu plant. So as its capacity is increased externally, we Suppere is able to do, just as we just said, to increase the utilization of this power. Of course, a number of people share with you, one where we can see that we are using a straight line of work, but this seems to be a bit complicated, so let's quickly talk about what is probably the difference. In 2025, just as we said, we were in 2022, so this year is the year of 2022, if I need to mass production capacity in Taichung plant in the next few years, 100%, so its cultural customer service in the past if you saw that it needed to drop to 40 percent in 2023, it would be reduced to 2025.



This is the result of this. Of course, today we will continue to talk about resources, and then we will talk about these things after the 12-creature movement. Well, just to share with you all about CNN semiconductor crystal meeting, of course there are some possible risks, we want to share with you how we think about this market risk, and how we can evaluate it. In this point, of course, that is, in terms of the appreciation of the dollar, the appreciation of the dollar is actually what we see in the short-term, we say only short-term, that is, in the second quarter, these three semiconductors are 1% appreciation, we will reduce now about 10%, they are satisfied with the bowl.

If you want to do this, you can do it in the first quarter of the year. If you want to do it in the second half of the year, you can do it in the second half of the year. If you want to do it in the second half of the year, you can do it in the second half of the year. If you want to do it in the second half of the year, you can do it in the second half of the year. If you want to do it in the second half of the year, you can do it in the second half of the year. If you want to do it in the second half, you can do it in the second half. If you want to do it in the second half, you can do it in the second half. Of course, we just talked about our main thing, I still want to retake, and now I want a few points. Well, first of all, we're going to hear about our time here, but in our business, we're not going to be from last year's 630,000 pieces, to this year's 80 million pieces, in fact, this fiction will be more than 30% of our rate of life.

Second, we will ask that in 2026 the annual meeting is very close to one million pieces, 1000 days, it is true, but of course, in the long run, Taiwan and overseas capacity allocation, this is what we are going to think about now, of course, if there are some final decisions, we will share with you again, when this time, it is likely that we are going to consider now. Then the new business, in fact, we just said, not only let our K-Level go, TestWave go, in fact, there is a feature, in the deep ocean semiconductor itself technology, to do a step up.

Of course, in the next three years, the new thinning use will also start, and there are some results that I can share with you. OK, of course, we have some visual costs in the past few seasons, I'll throw away, then these short-term exchange rates will have an impact, but we'll cut it, and we'll have a very clear part of it. Of course, the entire tariff has a unique help, to share, in fact, this impact is very low, there are a few factors I've just talked about, and this is the proportion, and of course, the most competitive price of our customers, it's already gone, so business can't use it to make it a loss of its competitiveness.

We are here to ask some investors to ask questions, well, we will have a few questions, first I would like to share the company's overall outlook for the semiconductor industry. I think the semiconductor of course use its length, it raises to basically high energy qualification, it is about 12 to 13 percent, of course, there will be some different segments, it will appear different structure, especially with advanced process and AI and HPC, and the cost of the main business, where the growth rate is very fast.

The last question is to ask the CB, that is, 80282, what is the current traffic, when can be converted, and is there a need for its company to pay a fee? OK, this is full of our problem is no problem, first of all, our 80282 is the second CB, in the basic one to twelve, issued in COSTIC, and then buy follow-up for trading, this is the first, the second part so far, we have provisions in Taiwan, of course, we know that shareholders won't have to spend more years, then there will be this, and then there will be this, so we're now the situation to stop the conversion, then we can start from June 25th, can start the conversion, can start, thank you.
