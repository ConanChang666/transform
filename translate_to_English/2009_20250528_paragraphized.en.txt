Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to visit our Women's Conference on May 28, 114. Today, our General Manager, Mr. Hung Mo-yang, will explain to you. Please present Mr. Hung to the General Manager.

We have a fair time business time for our supervisors. There is a quick export. We are sure that this is the first time this year. Today is the first time. The following is my report.

Please see the next one. This page is about avoiding the part of the application. Here is a clear item. This is the information form of this report. This is the assumption of the company's future operations. This is the number of forward-looking steps.

There is a risk and uncertainty. Actual results of operations may be. The duration of the listing. Even the number of forward-looking programs. Substantial differences.

Whether due to new developments, future events, or other reasons. The Company is under the responsibility of updating. Any difference in the number of forward-looking processes.

There are five items. The first one is integrated water conservancy. The second one is the weight of the product. The third one is Sassan. The fourth one is Clear Water Investment. The last one is a clear market.

That was in the first quarter of 114. Integrated water conservancy compared to the first quarter of 114.

Excellent 16.6 million $1000. That's the same word. Excellent 512 million $1000. Then in Maori. This first quarter of this year's word is 1047 million. 4000.

The first quarter of that year was $1280 million. The net loss of business was $539.7 million. The first quarter of that year was $1054,000. The external income and expenses of that year.

Negative NT$121 million7000. That's the same period. The remaining NT$178 million1000. That's the net profit before tax. Net loss of the first quarter.

That last year. There was a gross profit of $712 million 7000 yuan. The net profit of the whole period was. Negative $691,000 4000 yuan. The trading of US stocks. EPS is negative 0. 2.

This section is a negative part of the horizontal table of stocks. I will give you another look. This section is the list of products. It comes from the list of products. There are two scenarios for our classification. The first case is copper alloy.

There are also electrode materials. The second is copper alloy. The second is recycled electrode materials. The third is the electrode material of the iceworking materials. The plate and the middle profile. That is the first one.

The electric material of copper alloy. The electric material is ours. At the beginning. After 21 million years. There is no thicker surface. It is sold out.

In general, the word is about 20mm. There are no 10mm sold. That's what it is. The word of the material is probably.

It is below 4mm. 0. 1 That 0. 1. The second word is re-winding. That is, the inside of the copper sheet. Assuming it is below 0.8, I can continue the second processing.

The electroplating plate is sold again. This is the second part of the project. The third part is the ice work material. The ice work material and sheet plate. There is also a medium profile.

There is also a medium profile. The material is done after I finished it. It is the same after I made the first piece of material, and then directly to the customer.

The customer makes the mid-sized item. That's the other. I can also make the sheet. Then make the mid-sized item. Then sell it. The board part is also relatively thick.

That is a relatively thick part of the word. I don't do medium-sized. I sell it directly. That is the second paragraph of the classification. We are divided by ingredients. That is where the ingredients are divided.

Then the various signs are assigned. Those signs belong to the international code. CDA. The first one is the bucket. The section of the bucket. There is 1100 1020 1100.

11201 and 1220. The part of this bucket. That is, there are no other elements. Of course, back to the American people. We are not included. The second is concentric alloy.

The part of the concentric alloy. Add it. There are two kinds of ingredients. Distribute them. For example, 2801. Then 2,680 is 25% at the end.

Then 35%. 2,610 is 37%. Then the last word 2105 is 5%. Then always 95%. Then a few more core words. We call it concentric alloy.

The third argument is the same iron alloy. The third argument is the same iron. The eighth argument is the same iron. The ninth argument is the same iron alloy.

15:15 And We have indeed made it an example to their own time, and a lesson to their own generations, and a lesson to their own generations, and a lesson to their own generations, and a lesson to their own generations, and a lesson to all generations.

The tenth is the word of one heart. The fourth and fifth are the alloys. The tenth is the key word of the difference. We give it a little bit. That part is the Korean Xiaojun practice. That is what we are talking about.

The 112. The 112. The word from here. The word from here. You must divide it now. The word from here. Take it.

00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

If you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you may be looking for something new, but if you are looking for something new, you are looking for something new. Next, the next word here is to say the previous one, that according to the World Bank, this picture is, NHK's words, intervening in the World Bank, came out, according to the conclusion of the World Bank, in the 20th century, is the beginning of the 20th century, the margin is still 2000, every 2000 yuan, so fluctuation, basically, is the change, and then from the 21st century, that is, 2000 years later, the words start, up, has been floating, then that is the back of the words, continue to 8000 to 9000, before can be shaken, the fact of this year, this year, this year's gold price to the present time, more than 9000, the current, one to October price, about 9300.

In the past, the copper price was easily influenced by China, the infrastructure, the basic socio-economic construction, and then, before 2000, 2020, the Chinese economy, in fact, has been dumped, so the whole copper price, also by China's facilities, its needs and then rise, but after 2020, plus the new project, is the global currency, the background of the movement, those electric vehicles, power generation, renewable energy, demand increase, that with these added words, basically, Singapore's currency, that before 2020, the flux of this copper price, the factors are much greater, that after 2020, in addition to China's factors, in addition to the latter, that is, these negative electric vehicles, these two factors, will continue to grow.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any of the original text, so it must be kept sequentially and arranged into paragraphs in chronological order.

First, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a continuity of timestamps. The fragments given by the user are from 999. 00 to 1424. 00, each timestamp corresponds to a sentence. Next, I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and form a consistent paragraph based on semantic and logical relationships. During the processing process, I need to make sure that no sentences are missing while maintaining the original intention. For example, users mention time points such as "2025", "2023", "30", etc., these need to correspond to the corresponding forecast data correctly.

In addition, some sentences may involve professional terminology or specific data, such as "Minecore", "VSP", etc., need to keep the same as the original without any modification. Next, I will check in a row to see if there is a duplicate or need to merge, but according to the user's requirements, there can be no deletion or rewriting, so even if some sentences look duplicated, all must be retained. For example, "the demand for copper by 2035 must be doubled" and "this doubled word in fact seems to involve different aspects of the same concept. At the same time, attention to the interface between the sentences to ensure that paragraphs are smooth. For example, when the following sentences "the demand of copper by 2035" should be placed in the same paragraph to maintain the continuity of the context.

In addition, the "Affiliate Report" section referred to by the user involves data from multiple countries and groups and needs to ensure that this information is properly arranged in the paragraphs, such as the "American Alliance Group", "Chile Network Group", etc., each data point should be clearly presented. Finally, after finishing the preliminary finishing, I will read the entire paragraph typed text, check whether all the sentences are correctly preserved, no omissions or sequence errors, and ensure that the format conforms to the user's requirements, that is to use the Chinese punctuation, paragraphs separated by lined lines, without using any Markdown format.

That's what it says in 2023. It's what it predicts. It's 4000. It's what it predicts from 30 years to 5000. It's what it proves.

This is the story of the liquor industry. But at the same time, there is the story. It is going up. It is based on the data of the Ministry of Economic and Industry of Japan. Until 2035.

This is the word of God, which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God.

That's several times over. It's always over. It's over. Then the world's copper needs. The forecast is. Use this chart. Here's what you need to know.

That's it. It's the same as above. It's the end of the demand. It's the end of the demand. It's the end of 2035. It's the whole demand, more than five million words.

This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Hear it, and ye shall know it.

"This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many; they are many.

There is a demand, etc. It will be published. That is what we conclude in the speech. On April 18, 2025, we published an article. Let it come to an end.

The first paragraph of the second paragraph, that is, the preceding two. The preceding two. The copper of 479 billion. Then the more and more words.

That means global. The demand for copper. It only grows. So it depends on the industry. That's the world's largest wide-ranging wage. The VSP is predicted by 2050.

This VSP is a big group. It's probably what you want to do. That's the test. The demand for copper is actually growing. 70% will reach 50 million tons per year.

This is the story of the Japanese government. The story of the Japanese government. The story of the asylum until 2030.

5000 tons is too much. Here's what to say. You are the importance of copper. That's the ability to process copper ore.

51.3 This is the word of processing ability. It is the output of copper ore sand. It is not the same. In general, this refers to: refined copper. It is also the word of copper ore sand.

Place it in a saucepan, then place it in a saucepan, then place it in a saucepan, then place it in a saucepan, then place it in a saucepan.

This is the word of wisdom, which is the word of wisdom, which is the word of wisdom, which is the word of wisdom, and which is the word of wisdom, and which is the word of wisdom.

The word of copper sand. Then China will use 50% or 3.1%, because China will be the world's largest. Copper usage.

So it needs to be done. Always. Around the world. Buy copper sand everywhere. When you buy copper sand. Process it again.

It is processed from inside the chain plant. Then it is used. So it is more than the chain plant. It accounts for the distribution of the whole world.

More than the U.S. affiliate group. 15. 6%. There is also an intellectual network group. Yes 9%. There is also a Russian. There is a group.

5. 2% Another word. Is the group that imports the alliance. 6. 2% The five alliances. Why do you need to do the alliance. Is the fixed copper mine weight.

They are all on the wall. Let the ground know what to do. So there are a few leagues to talk about. Combine it, for example.

The Qur'an is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah, and it is the word of Allah.

I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it, I paid for it.

This is a list of words that contain abrasives, and words with abrasives in them.

In the first quarter, each refers to the amount of products to be sold. Here is the volume followed. Everyone knows the report from this point of view. This is the red part of the story.

3.3% of the shares. The anti-red disc is 8.6%. The zero gold hole is 0.9%. The high performance is 30.1%. The solid disc is 21.1%. The special alloy is 9.1%.

The word red rice is 6.1%. The word white rice is 1.1%. Then look at the next 12 pages. The word red rice is 6.1%.

On the left is the sales of domestic and foreign. On the right is the sales of foreign countries. On the right is the sales of foreign countries. On the left is the sales of foreign countries. On the left is the sales of foreign countries.

That's 26.2%. Foreign language is 33. 2%. This is the part of foreign country. That is, if you say it for the first time. Foreign country to buy. China South Korea Hong Kong Macau.

Almost none. 35. 8%. Thailand Myanmar Sri Lanka Malaysia. 25. 6%. Singapore Malaysia Indonesia.

13.9% of Japan's words are 8.2%. The others are 15.9%. That is, 30 foreign sales. Total sales accounted for 33.9%. That's another word in five provinces. These are the countries.

The third part is the development of low-income farmers. The main products and the global market are completed. That is a number. This is a three-part story. We will report to you again.

Not exactly these four items. The first one, that is, if my main product, is divided into these four items. The early one is about three. Now it becomes an extra item of that sporting material.

The first one is semiconductor. The second is a semiconductor. It uses a fuel pump. The main part here is 194 and 1921. This is a plate iron. The second is a car connector.

That car connector. There is a lot of production environment. For example, if I sell the building materials, then there is a circuit material. The part of the building materials. There is a 19210.

You see 19210 words. There are used in automotive connectors. There are used in semiconductors. There is a 194 behind there. There is also used in automotive connectors. There is also used in semiconductors.

So the three of them said, "This is my Lord, the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me, and I am the One who sent me."

210 are anti-roll series. Re-roll series. Sometimes single defense. That 194 is iron defense. Then there are 194.

This is the third verse in the Qur'an that says: "And when the Qur'an was revealed, it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed, and it was revealed."

This is what I use: this is what I use: this is what I use: this is what I use: this is what I use.

That's what I'm talking about, after all, is the part of the car's performance, that's what I use the most, that's me.

110 years and 1020 years. There is a 1920 part. The fourth item is ice-free products. So far, the same is true. About 190% of it.

Then there is 10% ice crystal. Then 260 years. That is 70%. And 30% ice crystal. The second is the first ketone water product.

Material sale. Here to see. Part of the semiconductor part of the story. The first part of the story. Is 355. The car goes.

Yes 225. The hot plate part is. 18.5 The ice control material is 65.5. That fit is 75. No tubes. Other.

Special information. Some buildings need to be understood in general. That's behind. This one is on the right.

This is the story of my journey, and it is the story of my journey, and it is the story of my journey.

The goal of the future is to have a semiconductor. To increase to 33, the car connection is 23, or the hot plate is 23. That ice cream production is also a fraction.

This is the eighth commandment: "And he that believeth on the name of the Lord shall be saved, and he that believeth on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

Another special core. Of course not. I've already put the other general core. That special core part of the talk. The material has 1501. And then the same high core.

Then there is 1814 1815. It is the same as the high-level core. 50715 the same interest core. There is the same internal core.

There are 7025 1901, which is the inner core. There are 19025. The inner core is the new core. These three belong.

New Year's Resolutions. The core of the development is new. There are currently some finished products. Then you are ready to come to the customer. Send the same wording.

That is the same as the wording. After that, thank you. The part 3 and 2 are both special cores. Why special cores?

Why do you develop these special cores? Increase its mechanical properties. Use it or my Lord's product core. This is the semiconductor. Automotive connectivity.

There are different cores. There are different cores. As an example, a car connector. That car connector. That.

[2223. 00-2262. 00] Regarding the ratio, there is not much to say about Taiwan. I do not own this material. In this presentation, we want to explain the current situation.

In the present case, in addition to what we both do in Taiwan, most of the material came from the copper factory in Japan. [2248. 00-2261. 00] In other words, it came from the copper factory in Russia. The highest-level words in these copper plates are in Russia.
