We welcome you to join us at today's Xinqing Electronics Industry Co., Ltd. corporate briefing session. We are honored to invite the team of Xinqing Electronics Industry Co., Ltd. to communicate with you online, and will explain the operation profile and future prospects at the meeting. First of all, we would like to introduce you to the leaders of the meeting: Mr. Hung Yufang, the first spokesperson.

Welcome two. At the beginning of the event, we first asked Hunter to explain the overall operation plan for 2025, thank you very much. Well, today we thank Dora, and today I am here to open a law for today. Here is a simple first, let's talk about 2025 with our advanced legal experts. That's now a view of the bright future of 2025, and a plan for the overall operation. Because we believe that there is no actual recovery of the entire economy in 2025, that the global politics, as well as the U.S. tariffs, and these constant fermentation of some unfavorable factors, so it seems that throughout 2025, in fact, the market is still conservative.

In the past, the solar energy photovoltaic technology, because some of the world's energy energy sources, in fact, is still growing, mainly at four o'clock. In the past, we have been slowly focusing on the automotive market to do the cultivation, in fact, we have been in the automotive market for about 12 years, in fact, there are some good results, the proportion of revenue is increasing. In the past, we were in charge of the charger charging system and the three-electric management system, then we will continue to do a lot of continuous product development in the automotive market, which is now our cultivation in the automotive market.

I have a solar photovoltaic photovoltaic, in fact, I need to have a system of energy storage to support a loan, that is, in fact, this part is also in the three years, the mood is constantly continuing to grow, that development is going to continue. In addition to the power market and consumer products, in the past, the proportion of revenue in the mood is very large, which is in the past, which is in fact, the continuous development of electronic industry in the world, constantly updated, in fact, the mood will not be absent, we will continue to do with our customers to do this development, we will continue to do a lot of product application and change.

We will be careful to develop a premium strategy with each customer, which is to achieve a balance between the price and the share of the market, so that our profits can be stable and maintain a stable water level. Then again in the raw material up this piece, we will actually ask for sourcing, do one, do a general purchase, let our procurement costs, in fact, can not climb too fast. The part of the manpower up, of course, we can continue to reduce our use of human resources, so that our product quality can be more stable, then through a strong increase, so that we can maintain a good quality of production cost, or a concept of production cost reduction.

We have a total of 7 production sites, and we continue to expand, the whole of our new Ching group has a total of 4200 partners. In the service base, we have a sales base in 25 countries around the world, which is our company.

In the past 16 years, we have seen a steady growth in our business performance. Our revenue can reach 3 billion yuan, accounting for 7 billion yuan. In fact, we can see that every number is stable, moving upwards is a steady growth momentum, and it is expected that you will invest in advanced advanced to give us a sure and support. Then again, we look at the strict part of the company, first set up a timeline for the factory, our company was founded in 1979 in Kaohsiung, then in 1996 we moved forward to China, set up our Changzhou factory and our Dongguan factory, in 1997, we set up Yilan factory in part of northern Taiwan, which is mainly sitting in one of our two collectives, mainly the semiconductor process part, which was listed on the exchanges in 2000.

[484. 90-487. 90] It was established in 2007 by Yichang. [487. 90-490. 90] In 2014, we established the Jiangxi plant. [490. 90-493. 90] was mainly supplied to the parts of our group. [493. 90-497. 90] In 2016, we expanded to the southern part of the Jiangdong area. [497. 90-501. 90] We also expanded to the second part of the south of Kaohsiung Plant 2.

[501. 90-505. 90] A factory that has recently been completed with an expansion plant. [505. 90-507. 90] There is a head factory in Kaohsiung under the stove. [507. 90-509. 90] I see an icon of the head factory. [509. 90-511. 90] There is also our Yichang factory. [511. 90-514. 90] This is a factory that has recently been completed and joined the production. ** Product presentation and technology evolution**.

[514. 90-517. 90] That's when the product was released. [517. 90-521. 90] We were listed in 1989 with a negative temperature coefficient of the thermosensor. [521. 90-524. 90] Added the pressure factor in 1997. [524. 90-527. 90] and our positive temperature coefficient of the thermosensor. [527. 90-529. 90] Added the PPTC in 2022. [529. 90-533. 90] is the so-called polymer positive temperature coefficient of the thermosensor.

[533. 90-537. 90] In 2018, there was an electrostatic protector ESD product. [537. 90-540. 90] In 2010, there was a gas discharge tube. [540. 90-545. 90] In 2016, there were part of the liquid liquid two collectives called TDS. [545. 90-549. 90] In 2018, we began to have a automotive market. [549. 90-551. 90] A vehicle version was added. [551. 90-554. 90] Part of the electric vehicle included our temperature sensor.

[554. 90-556. 90] applies to batteries and motors. **Sensors and composite product development**. [557. 90-561. 90] In 2004, we also developed pressure sensors. [561. 90-56. 90-56. 90] And temperature pressure sensors. [56. 90-567. 90] This is the result of our development last year. [567. 90-570. 90] And our pressure sensitive and gas discharge tubes.

[570. 90-573. 90] This is a new product we have listed last year. **Plant distribution**. [573. 90-578. 90] This page is a strict performance of our company. [578. 90-580. 90] Take a look at the plant. [580. 90-585. 90] In Taiwan, we have a total of two factories in Kaohsiung. [585. 90-586. 90] And a plant in central Kaohsiung.

[587. 90-589. 90] This place is mainly for the production of SMD series products. [589. 90-591. 90] The so-called patch type products. [591. 90-595. 90] Part of the two factories here there is a production of some sensors. [595. 90-598. 90] There are our two collective products here in Northern Taiwan. [598. 90-603. 90] That coastal area in China we have our China Dongguan factory. [603. 90-605. 90] and our Changzhou factory.

[605. 90-608. 90] That part of the outland we have Yichang factory and our Jiangxi factory. [608. 90-611. 90] This is mainly a part of our production factory. **Product series and design**. [611. 90-615. 90] That we have a total of three series of products at the product festival. [615. 90-616. 90] That we have a total of three series of products at the product festival. [617. 90-61. 90] That we have a total of three series of products at the product festival.

[619. 90-623. 90] There are temperature detection products and our overcurrent protection. [623. 90-625. 90] and our overvoltage protection. [625. 90-625. 90] There are so-called patch-type products and our plug-in products depending on the form. [629. 90-6332. 90] There are several designs that are more diverse here. [632. 90-635. 90] This is mainly the design of our so-called sensors. [635. 90-638. 90] These products are part of some customer products.

[638. 90-640. 90] According to the different requirements of the customer. [640. 90-642. 90] develops a number of different specifications. [642. 90-647. 90] That's where the icon is actually called temperature and pressure. [647. 90-649. 90] The new part of the sensor is introduced. [649. 90-653. 90] This icon is the compound pressure resistor we just talked about, as well. [653. 90-656. 90] We modified a composite protection component.

[656. 90-660. 90] That's one of our product attributes and how our products look. [660. 90-663. 90] is for investment advanced reference. **Operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2024**. [663. 90-667. 90] Then we look at one of our operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. [667. 90-670. 90] Our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter is 37. [670. 90-674. 90] The POP is 2.5 percentages compared to the previous quarter.

[674. 90-677. 90] YOY looked like a breeze of 4.7 percentages. [677. 90-680. 90] It looked like a slight decline in the fourth quarter. **market conditions and stock adjustments in 2022**. [680. 90-684. 90] The trend in the second half of 2022 saw a decline in the market climate. [684. 90-690. 90] In 2022, the entire mid-market was facing a high stock situation. [690. 90-695. 90] So we may have raised a situation in 2022 where stocks are pending.

[695. 90-698. 90] [698. 90-700. 90] is a two-year total degradation and adjustment. [698. 90-700. 90] is actually on the two-year scale. [700. 90-705. 90] We have gradually recognized some parts of the return of some of the stock in the last two years. [705. 90-706. 90] It is also us. [706. 90-710. 90] Inventory management is a big improvement and management. [710. 90-710. 90] That leads to some benefits of some of the return in the first two years.

[716. 90-721. 90] So it looks like gross profit margins have a good performance in the first two years. **Fees ratio vs. profit**. [721. 90-726. 90] The whole cost ratio is actually a very stable 15 to 17 percentages. [726. 90-728. 90] In fact, volatility is not too much. [728. 90-732. 90] In fact, it is true that our operating expenses are more stable than they are. [732. 90-734.2. 90] The quarter was 15%.

[734. 90-738. 90] The total turnover ratio was 22% compared to the fourth quarter. [738. 90-745. 90] The first two QOQs and YYYYs were slightly declined by about 2.5 percentages. **The net income and income after tax**. [745. 90-750. 90] The out-of-in-the-field revenue point is that this quarter is $84 million. [750. 90-754. 90] The first quarter and the same quarter last year actually increased a lot. [754. 90-757. 90] The main increase also included our interest income.

[757. 90-762. 90] and some of our factories have actually received some government subsidies. [762. 90-763. 90] and our exchange benefits. [763. 90-76. 90] This section gives us a look at it. [76. 90-768. 90] Our fourth quarter of the year saw our out-of-the-box revenues as a good performance. [768. 90-771. 90] The overall net income after tax rate was also 20% of our quarters. [771. 90-774. 90] The last quarter increased by 2 percentages.

[774. 90-779. 90] That is, the same period last year was actually a flat performance. [779. 90-782. 90] So one of the EPS in the fourth quarter was actually 3.13. [782. 90-785. 90] It was also a very good profit performance. [785. 90-788. 90] It was called QOQ in the previous quarter increased by 0.17. [788. 90-792. 90] It was said that last year YY saw an increase of 0.29. [792. 90-793. 90] It was in the fourth quarter.

[798. 90-802. 90] Our entire revenue was recorded in the same period last year. [802. 90-804. 90] In fact, it increased by 6.3 percentages. [804. 90-806. 90] 3% [806. 90-809. 90] The gross profit margin portion of the two periods is considered to be flat.

[814. 90-818. 90] The net operating interest rate is also quite equal to 0.23%. [818. 90-823. 90] The net interest rate after the entire tax period remained at 20% of the actual current fluctuation and did not fluctuate much. [823. 90-828. 90] The entire EPS we received this year was 12. 1. [828. 90-831. 90] The same period last year added to 1. 89. [831. 90-833. 90] You can see that. [833. 90-838. 90] Even a bad climate in the face of such a scenario.

[838. 90-844. 90] But we still maintain a level of profitability in our industry. **Balance sheet and liquidity**. [844. 90-846. 90] This is seen as a balance sheet. [846. 90-850. 90] One of our inventory is a continuous control. [850. 90-852. 90] In fact, we still need to keep monitoring and management. [852. 90-857. 90] The entire flow ratio is greater than 300%.

[857. 90-861. 90] is actually quite a safe flow ratio. **Fixed assets and capital expenditure**. [861. 90-866. 90] The entire fixed assets are actually a continuous expansion of the entire group. [866. 90-867. 90] And we are seeking equipment. [867. 90-871. 90] One of our capital expenditures is actually a continuous increase. [871. 90-876. 90] has entered one of our process yields.

[876. 90-881. 90] Then again, one of our debt ratios is actually maintained between 30% and 35% to fluctuate. [882. 90-887. 90] This debt ratio is relatively healthy to a proportional level. [887. 90-890. 90] This is a condition of the balance sheet.

[892. 90-896. 90] In the previous year, we pulled a five-quarter comparison. [896. 90-902. 90] One of our overall operating expenses was fluctuate from 15 to 17 percentages. [902. 90-905. 90] In the first two years, there was a 17% increase. [905. 90-911. 90] In fact, in this year, we have a slight decline to about 15. 5 percentages. [912. 90-915. 90] The R&D costs we still maintain. [915.2-918. 90] Our research and development costs are very important here.

[918. 90-922.2. 90] So we still maintain an investment in one of the 5 to 6 percentages. [922.1 90-925. 90] The part of the conduit fee is about 10%. [925. 90-929.9. 90] The cost is currently calculated at 15. 4 per cent. [929. 90-934. 90] The entire net operating interest rate we have in fact maintained at more than 20% of the net operating rate. [934. 90-937. 90] This is our current profit situation. **market distribution**

[937. 90-941. 90] It is distributed in the market. [942. 90-947. 90] It is calculated based on market revenues. [947. 90-951. 90] Our communication communications consists of 38 percentages. [951. 90-958. 90] It contains communication power supplies that contain so-called power sources and our city's power supply. [958. 90-962. 90] And our consumer electronics are included in our communications. [962. 90-965. 90] It is also our household appliances and lighting that account for 17 percentages.

[965. 90-969. 90] and our industry accounted for 16 percentages. [969. 90-972. 90] The parts of that car accounted for 15 percentages. [972. 90-976. 90] The volume of shipments actually accounted for the market share of our cars. [976. 90-980. 90] In fact, the volume of shipments increased by 34 percentages compared to the previous year. [980.

This is an adjustment to our revenue share based on market application. [1002. 90-1006. 90] In terms of management system, our management system attaches great importance to compliance. [1006. 90-1010. 90] In this new area, I really attach great importance to the management of a compliance of each part. [101010. 90-1014. 90] So we are all facing each aspect to achieve the relevant legal norms. [1014. 90-1019. 90] We have obtained ISO 9001 certification in the quality section.

[1019. 90-1022. 90] There is also a related quality management system that conforms to national certification. [1022. 90-1029. 90] There is also a related quality management system that conforms to national certification. [1029. 90-1031. 90] And occupational health and safety management system. [1032. 90-1035. 90] We also conform to ISO 45001 certification. [1035. 90-1038. 90] And our RBA is actually gold-grade. [1038. 90-1042. 90]

[1042. 90-1046. 90] In fact, we all have a certification related to the stock market. [1046. 90-1052. 90] It can be seen that we are very important in all aspects of our operations. [1052. 90-1058. 90] There are other components to our protection. [1058. 90-1062. 90] The electronic components say that we have a different certification that we are very important in security. [1062. 90-1065. 90] Many products are required to obtain safety certification. [1065. 90-1069. 90] In fact, we can see that a large range of products in each of our series have compliance with relevant safety certifications.

[1069. 90-1076. 90] contains the beauty of the European system as well as China. [1076. 90-1079. 90] We really cost a lot of money to obtain the relevant certification in one of the security certifications in each product. [1079. 90-1089. 90] indicates that our technical support is sufficient. [1089. 90-1092. 90] It is a global push in ESG in recent years. [1092. 90-1097. 90] Of course, the competent authority has also asked the various series to comply with an ESG specification. [1097. 90-1103. 90] Of course, there is no absence in this new part.

[1103. 90-1106. 90] We have a green manufacturing and green supply chain in the part of the environment. [1106. 90-1112. 90] We also want to increase the use of renewable energy. [1112. 90-1115. 90] It is also on the sustainability report that we have produced in 2023. [1115. 90-1119. 90] We actually reduce the use of carbon emissions by 9%. [1119. 90-1121. 90] We reduce the consumption of energy by 7 percentages. [1122. 90-1126. 90] We reduce the amount of our water intake by 11%.

[1126. 90-1139. 90] In the public interest, we have long sponsored a campaign to promote reading in Kaohsiung City. [1139. 90-1139. 90] We include a library of online book fairs and online cloud-based bookshops. [1139. 90-1143. 90] We have also actively promoted our employees to participate in activities such as public welfare. [1143. 90-1146. 90] We have included static and plant-based activities that contribute to ecological services. [1146. 90-1151. 90] We are based on the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct on corporate governance.

[1151. 90-1156. 90] We maintain the rights of workers to ensure health and the safety of the environment. [1156. 90-1161. 90] We adhere to the business ethics to develop management rules and regulations management system. [1161. 90-1165. 90] This is the promotion of AESG our company's efforts. [1165. 90-1169. 90] Where is our competitive advantage? [1169. 90-1173. 90] That we have mastered the core technology. [1173. 90-1177. 90] Here we see that we have a key to some material development.

[1177. 90-1181. 90] A technology we manufacture from material design materials. [1181. 90-1184. 90] We have our own R&D team that can select a key material. [1184. 90-1189. 90] And ceramic formulation technology allows us to be more competitive in the market of our products. [1189. 90-1194. 90] The design of our products contains S&D products. [1194. 90-1199. 90] is a patched product and our plug-in product. [1199. 90-1203. 90] And a combination of our traditional sensors.

[1203. 90-1206. 90] In fact, according to the design of different customers, we can provide a more complete service plan. [1206. 90-1211. 90] To provide a more complete service to meet their application of one product. [1211. 90-1216. 90] This takes process to see that we have stacking technology in our pre-process. [1216. 90-1222. 90] Painting technology Sintered technology and surface technology. [1222. 90-1225. 90] Let's take a confident process in the pre-processing process. [1225. 90-1228. 90] Let's take a closer look at some of the advantages of a full-line process.

[1228. 90-1233. 90] The part of our post-processing process is automated from packaging moving. [1233. 90-1237. 90] We have a complete advantage in automated production. [1237. 90-1240. 90] The amount of energy will ensure that we have a consistent product quality. [1240. 90-1245. 90] An investment in automation equipment. [1245. 90-1247. 90] This is part of some of the core technologies we have in place. [1247. 90-1251. 90] The product certification laboratory.

[1251. 90-1253. 90] It was just said that our protective components were really needed. [1253. 90-1256. 90] The product was marketed in accordance with safety certification. [1256. 90-1259. 90] This part of our new model itself has a UROG TUV approved laboratory. [1259. 90-1266. 90] indicates that we can do it ourselves. [1266. 90-1269. 90] We can provide it ourselves. [1269. 90-1270. 90] We can provide it ourselves. [1269. 90-1270. 90]

[1270. 90-1273. 90] My circuit protection certification service. [1273. 90-1275. 90] That is why we have such a laboratory. [1275. 90-1279. 90] The laboratory is managed in accordance with international regulations. [1279. 90-1283. 90] We are in compliance with international standards. [1283. 90-1286. 90] Our equipment and our personnel testing capabilities. [1286. 90-1290. 90] All of our equipment are in fact equivalent to that of the KIA.

[1290. 90-1293. 90] The results we measure are very reliable. [1293. 90-1296. 90] One of our own test equipment. [1296. 90-1299. 90] We can serve 100% of our own new product. [1299. 90-1303. 90] We can have a better grasp of the schedule of our listing of one of our products. [1303. 90-1306. 90] There is a case sharing there. [1306. 90-1310. 90] A manufacturer of L'Alan contact us.

[1310. 90-1314. 90] The product recommended to him is our PTCU and our KLM. [1314. 90-1317. 90] Self-protection is part of the insurance. [1317. 90-1322. 90] Later, he asked us to put his product on the market eight months later. [1322. 90-1325. 90] In fact, his subsequent team was asked for an update. [1325. 90-1328. 90] He hoped he could improve the self-protection room. [1328. 90-1333. 90] But this product requires UL and TUV certification.

[1333. 90-1337. 90] One of our engineering teams evaluated after. [1337. 90-1342. 90] After improving the performance of my self-production.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and convert it into a paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, must maintain the order and integrity of the original sentence. This means that I need to check every sentence one by one and make sure that every sentence is correctly kept in the final output. Next, I will look at the transcription fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, while others may require segmentation. For example, the user mentions that "I hope we all have the opportunity to do a layout of a product", which may be the same as the "this piece or we expect us to be in 2030" paragraph, as they discuss the same topic.

For example, after the "thank you" of [1521. 90-1523. 90], the following is a thank-you speech [1526. 90-1530. 90], which may be inserted by other speakers in the middle, so the correct segmentation is required. During the process, I need to make sure that no additional content is added, only formatting adjustments. For example, the user mentions "thanks to the help manager for us today," which should be a separate segment, as it is another speaker's thank-you word.

Also, pay attention to the consistency of the sentence. For example, [150. 90-1503. 90] sentences may be incomplete, but according to the requirements of the user, no modifications can be made, only the original sentence can be preserved. Therefore, even if the sentence structure is incomplete, it is necessary to keep it as it should and arranged correctly in paragraphs.

That is like a lot of every country, in fact, in this part of the investment, hope that we can take the opportunity to do a product layout. That is the part or we hope that by 2030, we can achieve a product business proportion of a target. That is more than a briefing on our side, thank you.
