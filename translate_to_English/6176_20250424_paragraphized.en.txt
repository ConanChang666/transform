<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and organize it into paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the content corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check if the timestamp corresponds correctly. For example, [0. 00-2. 86] is the "introduction meeting of photovoltaic corporation", followed by [2.2 86-4. 62] "introduction will start", and so on. It is necessary to check whether the content between each point is coherent and whether there is a duplicate or incorrect timestamp. For example, notice that after [265. 24-267. 24], is there any omission in the middle of the jump to [267. 24-269. 24]?

For example, there are several introductory sentences at the beginning that can be combined into a paragraph. The middle part has financial data and business prospects, which need to be segmented. At the same time, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any one sentence", so even if some content looks uncoherent or may be wrong (such as Russian or Chinese mixed parts), it must be kept as it is.

For example, [15. 60-19.42] and [19. 42-21. 16] can be combined as "the first one we have to manage our office quickly". It is also important to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that there are no omissions or duplicates. For example, after [249. 24-251. 24], is there any missing in the middle? But according to the original source provided by the user, the content in the middle has been processed, so it is processed according to the existing content.

At the same time, pay attention to the mapping of timestamps, such as [319. 24-322. 24] refers to the "last year was 441 million", and needs to confirm whether the context is coherent. Finally, check if there are any formatting errors, such as whether the parentheses of timestamps are correct, whether the punctuation marks are appropriate, and whether the transition between paragraphs is natural. To ensure that all content is kept in accordance with the user's requirements, not deleted, not rewritten, completely retains the content of the original text, and is organized into an easy-to-read paragraph form.

We are very pleased to welcome you to the meeting of Ruiyi Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., first of all, to introduce the company's management team. First, we have to ask for the quick management of the department's assistant. Ms. Huang Liang.

Now, let's start today's agenda. First, let's talk about today's agenda planning. Today's law will be divided into three parts. The first part will be called by Mr. Huang Liang. For you, let's talk about 2024.

As well as the results of operations for the first quarter of this year. The second part is chaired by Mr. Wong Yuk-chan. I would like to inform you of the Group's future layout and business outlook.

At the end of the day, we will accept questions on the site. The two supervisors on the stage will answer them. Please do not hesitate to ask questions.

First of all, we would like to invite Mr. Wang Yu-chao's speech. Thank you very much for coming to Ruiyi Photoelectric's legal meeting. I would like to take this moment of turmoil. The best thing is to sit down and communicate. Thank you for taking the time.

"My dear, my dear," he said, "today is the day of the Lord."

I am the constitutional figure. VII is Koc. This is the king of Japan. Good c√¥ng II. What is it? Because of the versus from the region.

That is, force. at the end you want a full system. Then you miss each component. So I think it will have a big impact on the central economy. That black swan is full of sky. Every day I brush my phone.

I don't know what will change this morning. That's under such uncertainty. So our visibility is very low. So ask me today on April 14th. The outlook for the year 2025. I don't have any reason for optimism.

We can only do the worst we can do with the best we can. But today is also a part of ultrasonic optics. It seems that you are very concerned about the advanced. There will also be some good news for you to do a report. We finished the delivery of Niott with the Danish company on January 9th this year.

We received a formal mass production order on January 16. We started shipping in February. It was the first batch of mass production shipments we expected. It was about three quarters early. So it was exciting. But we were not surprised.

That's before QA today. It's custom or previous style. It'll prepare some data first. Let's talk about some logic. Better prepare for Q&A I have two issues to talk to.

The first thing is the impact of tariffs on Ruiyi Optoelectronics. So I will mention the Q2 outlook. The 2025 outlook will also bring me to the backlight module and the front light those market opportunities and challenges. The second issue is ultraviolet optics.

I just mentioned that we've started mass production. So what mass production is. That's what it's all about. That's the belief that all media friends have in the news. A capital expenditure of 1.33 million is seen on the news of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. That's a five-year capital expenditure plan.

How to spend where to spend what to spend. That's to say today in the second session. Key message communicates with everyone. This part of Supervision Optics. In fact, in 2024 our company paid a good transcript. So we're also grateful to our customers.

We give thanks to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and for the blessings He has bestowed upon us, and for the blessings He has bestowed upon us.

Thank you all for coming today. We welcome you all to come forward. Then the media is good friends and guests. Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the annual corporate briefing.

That's what I'm talking about today. It's about the first quarter of this year and last year. A year-round overview of our operations. Our Silver Revenue for the year last year was 51.6 billion. The gross profit margin was 20.7. That's 15.63 per share.

Last year was 441 million. Our YOY growth was 17%. That was mostly just the part of the car that was slowing down. Almost all product lines were up. The gross profit margin was 20.7%.

That was about 20.1% last year. That was mainly because the YOY of the entire revenue was growing. The product portfolio part was also more optimized. Coupled with the impact of the depreciation of the dollar. So basically gross profit was better than 2023.

The growth of our business expenses is mainly because we are in. In 2014, there was a sales cost relatively high. This comes from a relatively one-time fee. It is the way the customer uses BDN to process the order.

In fact, we have a part of 2014. Some M&A fees are related to our internal organizational reforms. They happened in 2014. So the overall operating rate was about 25% higher than in 2013. That's the main reason. That's quite true for the entire net operating rate.

The main reason for this is the growth of the business in addition to its own growth. That is because the cost is also rising. Therefore, the increase and decrease is basically offset from each other. The net operating interest rate is maintained at 13%. If the part outside the business, we have two parts to report to you. The first is the portion of the exchange profit and loss.

In 2014, the dollar against the dollar was about 6.77% depreciated. That was in 2013. Our exchange interest in 2014 was about 17.87 billion. The whole EPS was about $2.98. The portion of interest income was about the end of September, so we usually made a time deposit.

So its impact on 2013 is not very big. So the net profit before tax is basically due to the contribution of the entire industry. Of course, the cost is slightly increased. The effect of the exchange interest is also increased.

So our EPS was 15.63. That was 38% growth compared to last year's 11.35. The income tax rate for 2014 was probably 29. That was 30% in 2023. The main reason was because we all knew that the dividends in 2014 were more comparable.

So the tax rate is slightly lower. If we say to restore this. EPS restores the exchange profit and loss back. Basically our 2014 EPS is about 12.65. That was 11.26. It was about 12% growth last year.

The gross profit margin is 19.84. The surplus per share is 2.33. The Rivenew portion is 1.2 billion.

That same quarter last year was 1.8 billion. It was probably 11% growth. The main thing was growth in the path and notebook. We were 14.7 billion in Q4. That was 18% down compared to this quarter. That was the part of our iMonitor growth.

The rest of the product is growing. --- (Keep all the original sentence content intact, do not delete or rewrite anything)

[564. 24-567. 24] Because we all know that this year's Q1 is a Chinese New Year, so the number of days for work is less. [567. 24-569. 24] So there is a seasonal effect. [569. 24-571. 24] So the Maori part of that is, because there are few days for work, and there are a lot of overtime costs are relatively high if the Chinese New Year is to go to work. [573. 24-576. 24] Another thing is that we Rivenew delivered on January 3, so this year's Q1 basically you have the associated operating costs, sales costs, and the entire operating costs are added.

[576. 24-579. 24] So our entire gross profit and operating expenses are affected. [579. 24-581. 24] If the gross profit relative to YOY, the impact of the product portfolio is basically 19.8 compared to 19.5 or slightly higher. [581. 24-584. 24] That for Q4 was down about 20%. [584. 24-588. 24] Well, we talked about the net profit of the business, the net profit of the business is basically influenced by you, it has an impact on the gross profit of the business, which accounts for about 1% more. [588. 24-592. 24] So the whole business net profit reached 10% compared to the previous quarter, about 2% compared to the previous quarter. [592. 24-596. 24] The difference was 29% because Q1 had an impact on the spring season, so it did not equal to 29%.

[596. 24-600. 24] The external income part of that business is the same as two parts to report with you, the first part is the external benefit part. [600. 24-604. 24] The first quarter of this year was probably 1.28 percent depreciation, which was the same period last year was 4.22 percent depreciation, which we saw when Q4 was about 42% depreciation in the same period last year. [604. 24-608. 24] So the depreciation of Q1 is less than these two quarters, so the external interest in Wale-1 is about $900, so the EBS is about $61, then Q4 is about $61.24.

[620. 24-624. 24] The main income tax rate is relatively low because it has just mentioned its exchange interest is relatively large, then the exchange interest is generated in our overseas company, so it is no income tax, so the income tax rate is relatively low. [624. 24-628. 24] So Q1's EBS is 2.33, the same period of time. 18, Q4 is 3.93, if we give the same exchange interest factor to exclude it, it is probably 2.25, then 2.49, and 3.24. [628. 24-632. 24] I just mentioned that after the whole NEO combined, the whole cost of the whole cost of the NEO came in, and that the loss of the EBS was probably 8., so if we restored it all, in fact our Q1's business should be better.

[644. 24-648. 24] Let's take a look at the balance sheet, which is a total assets of $6.9 billion, which is about 5 billion more than last year. [648. 24-652. 24] The total debt is 296 billion, which is higher than 24 years, and the cash portion is 320 billion, which last year was 331 billion. [652.2 24-656. 24] It's a lot of people will be curious to know how much I spent on the only 1 billion, mainly because we're in this Q1, because we're doing our business, because the revenue slips basically Cash in, here there are about 2.7 billion. [656. 24] Another we's all over the financial operations, we've got some to operate short spreads, here we's we've got a long-term borrowing, and we have a very low interest from the long-term borrowing banks. [6664.24] So after this cash in our entire cash in, we don't have not affect our entire cash level. [66666666. 24] There are basically all of our seasonal stocks, we'slideslide, we's, and there's, because we's, because we's, we're still have a lot of our assets.

[668. 24-684. 24] Then he saw more of the business area, that is, after we moved in on Jan. 3, we are now due to the fact that the PPA has not yet been in the stage of PPA, so the temporary difference is in the business area. [672. 24-676. 24] This is probably the case, the business area is about 93 billion. [680. 24-680. 24] This is the description of the balance sheet. [680. 24-684. 24] Well, then we talk about our financial ratio, the first one is the balance ratio, and the main impact of the debt ratio is basically, the long-term borrowing we just mentioned, and the short-earing portion of the loan we have about 2.5 billion.

[692. 24-695. 24] I want to go on the previous page. [695. 24-697. 24] I'm sorry. [697. 24-701. 24] Well, the part of our application of the product is that our notebook and monitor are on the rise in the first quarter. [701. 24-705. 24] Our Q1 of this year accounted for 0.4% of the turnover, so you can see that our super lens has already started shipping, although it is very small at present, but this is a year for us, it is a year for us. [705. 24-709. 24] Well, and then, if we compare to 223 and 24 years, we grew about 11% on the tablet, about 10% on the NB and Monitor, the growth rate of our monitor thanks to the application of the whole color, is 429%.

[713. 24-717. 24] In principle, we all know that our current capital expenditure is now known, because Malaysia is in progress, and the other is that our chess field and Zhunan are also in progress. [717. 24-721. 24] Our current plan for Vietnam is to complete Q3, which Q4 will be mass production, so the entire expenditure will fall within the next two or three years in 2025.

So our capital expenditures in our own internal estimate, 2025 is probably about 4 to 5 times that of 2024. That is, I just said, the Malaysian field will be in the back of the production line, the chess field and Zhunan are still ongoing, and Vietnam should be a paragraph this year. So in 2026, the capital expenditure will probably be the same as 2025. Next, we have to say that the status of our entire capital expenditure, we see that we have such large capital expenditures, which may also see in the news that we have recently have a lot of capital expenditures with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Ministry has a low borrowing, where the capital expenditure is about 13 billion, which is mainly used in the chess field and Zhunan.

In the future, we will always look at the changes in the market, then we also have a slight estimate of the amount of our bank borrowing in Taiwan is about 8 billion to 10 billion, then our current short-term borrowing rate is actually zero, and we do not use any short-term borrowing. We have a preliminary estimate that our global bank quota is about 30 billion, our current volatility is about 1.48 billion, which I just reported that we may have some over-the-counter operations to earn this short-term margin, that volatility is about 4.8%. So basically, we will update our mass production situation, that is, we expect Q3 mass production in Vietnam, basically we will mass production is Q3 in Vietnam.

The above is my report, then we ask Dong Han for the future outlook, then we ask Dong Han for the future outlook, then we ask Dong Han for the future outlook, then we ask Dong Han for the future outlook, then let's try, OK, good QMESSAGE is, good QMESSAGE is. Today, we will be divided into two parts, we will talk about BATLIGHT followed, I will talk about some opportunities and challenges of the Roll-to-Roll program, and that is far away from optical.

In the first part, the direct cut into the backlight module, that is, the direct impact on tariffs is almost nothing, because we did not ship any BATLIGHT to the United States, but we have some materials from the United States into China to assemble. The materials of the direct feed have some challenges in the target, so it has some high cost, so it has a rise, so we will also reflect such a thing with the customer, but in fact, directly because of the impact of tariffs on the sharp light current of all the customer base does not have much effect.

In fact, when Mr. Trump began to fight tariff war news on April 2, we actually downgraded the LCM manufacturer's pull in April, and we actually downgraded the LCM manufacturer's pull in April, and we pedaled the brake for about a week, so we should be a bit dip in April, but these 10 days we saw the customer's focus in May, so we observed that it should be Q3 the amount of goods pre-stocked. So another factor is that we are in the new model, that this year is less than the year, but these models we are just looking forward to, including the padbook, and so I think it is very good.

So this is the backlight part, because we accounted for 95.5% of the backlight, so we are here to explain the whole year, and then I mentioned our row to row this product, such a process, it is a roll-to-roll stamping, so we all know that the two years in the world of display, in e-paper applications such as application, is a high degree of hot discussion, then we acquired Finland NanoCon in 2023, it is the world's top front panel manufacturer. Of course, we just like the Chief Financial Officer, we just showed the amount of production in the front...

In addition to shipping, we also have a strong technical team, and in fact, we also have resources to share, from black and white to color, and we also mass production of the world's thinnest front panel, so the front frame market I think can be expected to do so. In addition to the situation of this roll technology, we also attracted the customers of these tablets and laptops from our current existent, who wanted us to use plastic injections in these light boards, can not use film to make beds, of course, a big decision is that the Z-high film is thinner, so the film will be more thinner than we did before, so now existing Bedlight manufacturers are looking for us, we also use Z-high to use the Z-high guide to light film, so we see some opportunities in the front frame part of the front frame, so that the roll to this process to roll the first time into the reeld reel. This part of this refers to the products related to the Bedlight scroll to roll, then I now mention ultraviolet optical, ultraviolet optical part I explained in two parts, the first is where we are different, I think we have no stranger about the metal lens, that is, in mass production, Nare optics in ultraviolet optical differences where, then you have such a difference, then you will tell us now what we will do with the future, just to say that I will spend a lot of money, that is just to let you understand the whole logic, where our bottom gas, into that, so we should go forward with some things, and new knowledge, we did in September, we acquired the company in January, it was founded in 2006, and it was very profitable, it was made in the mold, the nanostructure mold, so we said that in 2019, we would use it was the most of the time to do with the next year, we have to do it, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we will be in January, we have a new product, we will be in January, we have a new product, we have a new product, and then we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, the next next year, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, then we have a new product, we have a new product, we will a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a lot, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we will a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we will a lot, then we have a new product, we have a new product, then we have a new product, then we have a new product, we have a new product, we will a new product, we will a new product, we have a new product, then we have a new product, we will a new product, we have a new product, the next next next year, we have a new product, the next next year, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we have a new product, we will a new There are a lot of possibilities, from the just mentioned backlight frontlight, then there are some special optical molds, then we use A-Tiglary this film, can be applied to OLED display, Michael Lanser Ray such a concentrated film, can be applied to MicroLED, so through these RotorUVI, we try to maximize its value, in the world of even without LCD, we want to know how we exist, then of course, we will focus on wafer-level optical words, and then there is a part of AR Waveguide, we can also attack a market, so today this pyramid, we focus on wafer-level optical components, and today we want to talk about Metal Optics, that I am back to the logical three beads, but first to tell you about the optical part, we have the optical tool of our In-house Optical Simulation, this is also when we are communicating with Neo T. **[1515. 24-1519. 24] Our optics have our In-house Optical Simulation Tool, which is also when we communicate with Neo T. **[1519. 24-1523. 24] We have our In-house Optical Simulation Tool, which is also when we communicate with Neo T.

We are very impressed, he took five years to build this In-house Simulation tool, then Prototyping out of the process, he did the characterization, all of them in-house, and he could also make them very efficient to Layout their nano beads. Then it turned out that we all communicated with customers from the perspective of the application from Prototyping to Mass Production, which is what the customer wanted.

We have been able to recommend our customers in the Mass Production above you in the Mass Production projection, we have already used a mass production perspective to communicate with the customer that part of the design, so there is actually a Dialog here, it may be backup not to have too Extreme design, Scroll up its subsequent Replication, so in addition to this, we have provided a lot of value to our customers in addition to fast. That just mentioned the Replication, we also have a big point in Scalability, where I started to emphasize today where precision meet scale. We in this respect, we embrace this Scalability, because our speed costs, our equipment, and so on the investment, I believe that it is more expensive than semiconductors, but we did not commit to the high precision structure of the moment, so we have to eat it in this way, so there is a very much that we have to do this.

Flexibility is a luxury in the world of optics, we let our customers in the design rule he has the idea of moving forward, we let them in the material selection, they can also try new materials, because we have a high Resilience process to support, that is, let customers enter into or have the courage to think about Metalance we gave him a big bottom line, so we brought to the customer Centric Optical Solution I mentioned at the beginning. We want to find some key value, not what you buy, not what you buy, what is you want to create. So we hear this Slide with Recap, the company or the three pillars, we are optics, in Master's self-replication, this five-diagment triangle communication, Inhouse, Inhouse Turnaround, and then we Stritch customer Flexibility, which we are in this very, we want to provide a good service.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided.

For example, a few sentences about TX's 3D Sensing and industrial robotics applications may belong to the same topic, which can be combined. Similarly, parts of Malaysia's capacity expansion and future planning may require segmentation processing. It should be noted that the user mentioned "permanent verb-cutting verbatim" may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence, so it is necessary to ensure that no sentences are missing during the reorganization. At the same time, it is necessary to keep the original timestamp, but users may want to remove the timestamp in the final output, leaving only the content.

In the process, I read through a few sentences to identify the conversion points of the topic, for example, from introducing product features to capacity expansion, and then to long-term planning. Each topic may require a separate paragraph. At the same time, note that consistency between sentences may require adjusting the sequence of sentences, but the original intention must remain unchanged. For example, a user mentions, "What is the product we are talking about now in mass production", and the next sentence explains that the product is a 3D Sensing of TX for industrial robots. These can be combined into a paragraph.

In the process, I will ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are logically consistent without jumping. At the same time, I check whether there are duplicates or redundant content, but I cannot delete anything according to user requirements, so even if there are duplicates, it must be retained. Finally, I will read the paragraph-based transcription of the entire transition to ensure that the original content is properly preserved, without omissions or errors, and that the transition between paragraphs naturally matches the logical order.

A 3D Sensing sensor from TX is a 3D Sensing Dubjector used in industrial robotics. It has a few characteristics that I think it has. It includes the use of a robot, it has a long power supply, and then the heat of the Sensor, today we are Glass Wafer, it has a very good Thermal Stability. And we are another Metal Lens, and we have replaced the DOE with a lightweight, small foam factor, and the High Efficiency Low Power Consumption.

So today's goal, Ramp-Up in Malaysia, let Engineering go back to Switzerland to do their thing. We also went to Expand us Malaysia, so we've extended our absurdity, and this year we've started to play some Lonely Time Equipment. Next year we're going to talk about our next Mid-Term part, and we're going to scale the line in Malaysia again. Why? So today we're going to talk about this Mid-Term, Consumer Electronics Volumes.

I bought it with only one goal, Metal Lens, Which means of high-end consumer electronics, Metal Lens, Metal Lens of High Precision Extreme Design, Cost to meet customers, Quality to meet customers, this is my Day 1. If I bought NiOT today, this is my Day 1. So now, we just have what we've ported. That's what we've got to do, you have to be ready for Capacity, you need a Plane of Record. So we're also looking for our customers to be Malaysia side, and then we've got Case to give them these Data Sets in mass production.

So next year in Malaysia, next year at DQ4, we should be able to have a monthly capacity of about 1 million or more Wafers, about 2 to 3 so-called Consumer Electronics Volume. We also think that this is a reasonable plan for Mid-Term, not to say that the kitchen is too big to open. But if we just mentioned that we have the opportunity to go to Mass Produce Consumable Volume in 2 to 3 years, we are of course open up all the possibilities. So this part of Long Term, we are now thinking of Metal Optics Everywhere.

This is the reason why we have all three production lines of Lesson Learned in Malaysia, all Config, all of your PLM MES systems, combing them, then we will because many of the current Rate mass partners are in the Penang factory, we are Report to Neo T people, we are the oceans, but OK we are to consolidate our experience together, this Lesson Learned in 2027 Q4, when Kaohsiung Plant 7 dust-free room is covered, we will go to Plug in this stuff. If we get our Mid-Term Goal Consumption Electron Volume, then there is a lot of demand in the world, that is not a line, probably a multi-line line. So clean room is ready, that in the engineering part of the EU, of which we are continuing to invest in, EU, we may add some EBIN, some of the Engineering Resource, some Talent, we will continue to Hire Local Talent, we go to Tap into the Nordic Area, Finland or Optics, or Op Energy in Taiwan.
