If you have any questions about the company's container, the company's business development and the market situation, you are on the line to invest in advanced. Write your questions in our chat room. The company will provide you with a detailed answer at the time of QA.

We have asked the company to first show us the presentation. We have asked the company to help us turn the screen into the full screen. Here is what we can see. Well, here is our 2025 first quarter of the Chinese container. The online presenter is Chiang Liang-ping, our business department.

Our speakers are Jiang Liang-Ping, our business unit. Senior Managing Director and our Treasurer. Then our Vice President. We will be provided with a detailed briefing by the two Chief Executives. Will the Chief Executive be online?

Can you hear me now? Yes, I'm the boss now. Thanks. That's right, we're here to help. Let's start with a briefing now.

Okay, so I'm starting to take over now. Yes. Thanks for the heads up. I'm the director of China's container business. My name is Jiang, I'm called Jiang Liang-Ping. The legal person explained the meeting.

First, I would like to introduce you to some information about some parts of our company's business department. I would like to jump directly to the information here. Well, let's talk about business information. We would like to start exploring this trend of the entire container port in Taiwan. We can see the loading and unloading of our entire four international malls in the first quarter of 2025.

The first quarter of this year was 336. 40,000TU. It was the same as the first quarter of 2024. 337.88,000TU said it was about 0.4. 0.4 percentage points. The four shopping malls said it was basically the port of Geelong, Taipei, Taichung, Dangang.

I'm going to go ahead with that. I'm going to explain to you about the four ports. Let's first look at the port of Geelong. The first quarter of Port of Geelong. We see how much we do in Port of Geelong is 370,000TU. That's the same period as last year.

37. 50,000 TU. It is a decline of about 5000 TU. The total proportion is 1. 4 percentage points. The reason for the decline is basically that.

A relatively low season. Then many merchants take advantage of this traditional low season. For example, do some tax breaks during the spring holidays. Arrange some tax breaks into the house tax holidays. Then, coupled with the first quarter of this year is less likely to say.

So it may be in the first quarter. It has several lines of the city there is no way to directly rely on our Geelong. So it leads to this amount. It has to be said in the same period last year less than 5000TU. That is, in fact, part of the port of Geelong.

It consists of routes. I would like to introduce them to you. It consists of cross-strait routes. It also includes the Jinyang Line and the Ocean Line. Part of the cross-strait lines account for about 43%. Jinyang accounted for about 19%.

That part of the ocean line accounts for 35%. That's the part of the ocean line of the port of Najlong. One of the routes we speak is the American line. This is the import and export route from Los Angeles to Geelong. The other is the middle and South American route. Central and South America to Geelong.

This is part of the so-called ocean line. So this is what the port of Geelong is talking about this year. Speaking of the first quarter. The reason for the decline in volume is mainly because I just mentioned it.

He was not able to get the four-wheeler in the first quarter, so he probably couldn't rely on it, so this part of the decline was the port of Geelong. Then we went back and saw the port of Taipei.

That's the story of the Port of Taipei. We did it in the first quarter. It was about 35 million Q. That's more than last year. Last year we did 34.4 million Q.

It's an increase. It's an increase. It's an increase of 1. 9%. That's what Taipei Port says. It's mainly three carriers.

Our three domestic carriers. Come together to fund operations. The three carriers are EVA, EVA and Yang Ming. EVA accounts for about 50%. EVA accounts for about 40%. EVA accounts for about 10%. EVA accounts for 10%.

So basically. Taipei Port is funded by these three carriers. Last year, it was the beginning of the year. Taipei Port. It moved two large routes to Kaohsiung Port. That was because it was the beginning of the year.

changrong has a new completion of this pier on the Kaohsiung Motor Rail. So it is for the amount of its motor rail. It has moved a lot of two routes past. So you can see. In the first quarter of 2024, it fell by 21.1% last year.

That's why the amount of that time moved to Taipei Port, but this year it was a bit better, so we've seen it this year.

In contrast, the port of Taipei has added a new route. The new route is between the sea and ONE. The route is in the United States. So its volume is about 6000 TAUs compared to last year.

1. 9% increase. That's the situation in Taipei Harbor. Come back and see us. Taichung Harbor. We talked about it in the first quarter of 2025. Totally done 37.8 million TAU.

The last year was 40.7 million TAU. Compared to last year, it was about 7.23 percent less. It was a small portion of the major Taichung port. It was made up of the Taichung port route. Mainly the two sides of the route and the offshore route.

That cross-strait route accounts for about 40%. The near ocean portion accounts for about 60%. That's what I just said. This is because in recent years, we import and export to mainland Taiwan's freight share.

Some of them are made of wood, some of them are made of wood, and some of them are made of wood, and some of them are made of wood, and some of them are made of wood, and some of them are made of wood, and some of them are made of wood.

This is the path of the righteous, and the path of the wicked, and the path of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked.

This is the story of the year. This is the part of the transfer. The part of the transfer with the mother ship becomes a bit less so you can see the part of the Taichung port. This year's workload talk about this year.

The volume of operations in the first quarter of this year. Compared to the first quarter of last year. Compared to the first quarter of last year.

About 7.2% less. That's the case in Taichung Harbor. Well, after seeing the Taichung Harbor, we'll go back to Kaohsiung Harbor.

Total of 226 million. 226 million TU. That's what we talked about in the first quarter of last year. 225 million TU is a quarter of the season. Speaking about the change is not so much. But a little more.

The increase is about 0.6 percentage points. The percentage is basically the port of Kaohsiung. In fact, it is the largest port of our entire Taiwan. It is the largest port of the international mall.

That's a lot of imports and exports. This is a two-way route, the United States and so on. They all rely on this port of Kaohsiung. It's actually the port of Kaohsiung that hasn't changed so much this year and last year.

The volume is still stable. So the increase is only about 0.6 percent. This is the condition of the Port of Kaohsiung. That is the first part of the story. We will focus on the loading and unloading of the four international ports.

That's what I'm going to say. I'm going to report to you. China Cargo will do some of its business throughout Taiwan. The scope of distribution is in the form of. That's what it actually says. China Cargo will say in Taiwan.

We went to two piers. The north is the financial port. The middle is the Taichung port. We are in the financial and Taichung area. We have our own container operation. The financial port part.

We rent the marina. We rent the marina with TIBC. No. 19 and No. 20 and No. 21. There are three marinas in total. Port of Taichung. We rent the part No. 9.

Then number 10 and number 11. Add the back of number 31. Talk about the terminal operator in the entire northern financial port. There are about three. That is, outside of our Chinese containers. There are TIBCs.

TIBC is a Taiwan-based port trading company. It is basically a Taiwan-based port trading company. Financial branch. The other one speaks to the financial container operator. It is the Yanxi of the East Coast. So the whole financial port terminal operator.

There are probably only three operators operating the terminal. What we say about the East Coast is Yanxi Cargo. Yanxi International Holdings Co., Ltd. The West Coast is part of our China Containers.

It's a financial situation, except for our Chinese containers.

There is also the sea of Long Dragon and the sea of Wanhai. We are the rear of Pier No. 9 and No. 10. There is also the back of Pier No. 31. That is 32 33. That is 32 and 35.

This is about us. The Chinese container is in the northern agency. This part of the container. This is our finance and the middle of the middle.

The shape of the container operation. Well, let's look at the next page. The next page is about the loading and unloading of the container terminal. Let's make a comparison. Let's first look at the section of the financial port.

That's the part of the financial port. We spent the whole year last year in the financial markets. We had a total of 71.9 million TEUs. TEUs are container units. It's a 24 container unit.

The yellow part is the port company. It is the financial port company I just talked about. The financial branch of the Taiwan port company. He made 33.4 million TEU. The remaining part is the east coast annual salary.

He took a total of 59.7 million TEUs. Let's take a look at last year's one. The ratio of workload is about 43.5%. This is about 43.5%.

That's what the TIPC said. He accounted for about 23%. 25. 3% of the East Coast annual salary. That's about 31%. So in terms of contraction in this container. So in terms of contraction in this container.

The financial part of our Chinese container loading and unloading. The proportion is relatively higher. The proportion is relatively higher. That is the case last year. Let's look at the picture on the right. The picture on the right is the first quarter of this year.

Compared to the first quarter of last year. The first quarter. We did 16.1 million TEU this year. The TIPC did 7.7 million TEU. That. The annual salary.

The East Coast pays for an annual salary of 13.2 million TEU. That's basically what we're talking about. Probably the part of our Chinese container with this year's salary. There is a decrease in the part. Of course, the part of the TIPC has increased.

I've already told you before. Probably because there are some merchants in the first quarter. Do some evaluation adjustments. Let the ship into the house. Some of our main customers are like Postco. That's China Ocean.

That he had some pilots. He couldn't get us, so we were less than that. That's basically what we were talking about. The amount of our containers decreased mainly for these reasons. The first quarter.

That's it. After seeing the comparison of the loading and unloading of this port of Geelong, let's take a look at this again. Round flats are the so-called percentages. That's just what we're talking about. Basically, we're talking about these three.

Container repair company. The percentage of the amount of his share. This year compared to the first quarter of last year. There was not much change. We China still accounted for 43.5%. That was the extended part.

35. 77%

The Hong Kong and Macau companies have increased some of the 20.73%. This may be because of the annual salary of the Hong Kong and Macau companies, he has some of the port congestion, he does not have time to do some of the services provided by the ship, so the Hong Kong and Macau companies have increased some of the percentages.

In the first quarter of this year, we were part of China's container in Taichung, doing 12.7 million tew, then compared to last year's speech, which was about 4.1 million tew, we probably also reduced. That long text, he also reduced, Wanhai and other parts of him also decreased. The reason for that reduction, we also said before, is that this may be gradually, some strategy adjustments, some of us are our manufacturers, some parts of the manufacturers in Taichung, some of them are some proportional adjustments, so to say the whole amount of speaking compared to the parts of Hong Kong and Macau, this is a little decrease, this is in Taichung.

This is the reason why changrong and wanhai have their own background is carriers, so there are a number of cabinet adjustments around the world in the first quarter of this year, that is, from the mainland China or other East Asia exports, because there may not be so many cabinets, so they will have a strategic line of adjustment, so they say in the part of the cabinet adjustment, so they have some increase in the amount, not the real goods, but some increase in the amount, so they are not like the Chinese container, because the Chinese container itself is a leaf, we are not like the background of the carrier, some adjustments, so take a little more than some of our China will adjust a little bit, that is the part of the Chinese Hong Kong part.

The first is because this globalization has the whole fragmentation, it is no longer the whole, such as the globalization, such as some problems such as tariffs and all aspects of the problem, it is no longer the whole fragmentation trend. Then, of course, the second is the part of inflation pressure, and the second is the part of inflation pressure. There is also the whole world's factory, the whole economy of China, the whole situation of the whole economy, the whole world's factory, the whole economy of China's economic situation. And the other external we, the red sea Suez Canal, and the Russian-Ukraine war, the conflict is part of the enemy's conflict, four aspects to observe.

That is because of this change in the tariff policy of the peer, which is because of this change in the tariff policy of the peer, so many countries have their businesses.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any original sentence, all sentences must be kept and not summarized. This means that I need to do a step-by-step check to make sure that each timestamp and corresponding sentences are properly preserved and arranged in logical order into paragraphs.

First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses topics such as global economic impact of production base relocation, inflationary pressure, export situation in China, maritime market conditions, and supply and demand balance. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or paragraph in order to make a reasonable segmentation. For example, at the beginning of a few words to mention the production base relocation, then discuss inflationary pressure, then China's economic problems, then turn to the maritime market for ranking and supply and demand analysis.

For example, sentences about production base relocation should be placed in the same paragraph, followed by the part of inflation pressure, then China's economic impact, and then the shipping market's ranking and supply and demand analysis. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, such as multiple sentences about inflation pressure should be linked together, forming a consistent paragraph. At the same time, it is necessary to check if there are duplicate sentences, such as "will increase the production cost of the enterprise" two times, user requests do not have to be deleted, so it is necessary to adjust the position to avoid duplicates.

In addition, some sentences may belong to the same logical point, such as the tension in the global labor market and difficult to fall back on prices, should be combined into a paragraph. When dealing with the shipping market section, it is important to pay attention to the ranking and market share data, categorizing the relevant sentences into the same paragraph, such as the ranking and market share of the top three carriers, the ranking of Taiwan carriers, and the supply and demand analysis.

All of his production bases are slowly moved back to their own country. All of his production bases are slowly moved back to their own country. So this generates an action to reorganize the entire global population as before. What is the part of inflation pressure? Of course, this will certainly increase the production cost of the enterprise due to the increase of tariffs.

The global labor market will be a little more stressful. The global labor market will be a little more stressful. Then the price will be harder to return to the original price. Then the price will be harder to return to the original price. Of course, it will continue to be fermented.

Inflation pressure then delays this rate. That high rate of interest policy may affect the growth of the economy as a whole. That high rate of interest policy may affect the growth of the economy as a whole. Let's look at the part of China. The whole cost of China's export industry production is slowing down.

The U.S. has another problem with tariffs. China's economic problems. China's economic problems. China's economic problems. It is even more challenging. The foreign part is slowly due to these reasons.

Slowly because of these reasons for trade war tariffs. The division of the withdrawal of the entire China. For China, his entire economic pressure on him and the improvement of the deficit may increase. That will affect the outlook of the economy as a whole. The geopolitical part. That will affect the entire economy.

That will affect the economy as a whole. That will affect the economy as a whole. That will affect the economy as a whole. In contrast, some corresponding solutions to these conflicting governments will increase some expenditures. And it will be squeezed into other economic development plans. These are some of the key factors that affect the global economy.

Some of the key factors in the global economy. On the next page, let's report the current status of the maritime market. This page shows the ranking of the top 20 global carriers. The first is the MSC. The MSC is the so-called Mediterranean shipping, which accounts for 20.1%. The second is the Musk Group, which accounts for 14.3%.

That third point is CMA, which accounts for 12.2%. I report here that we see about 90% of the world's top three and even the top five 20 carriers in the world are our Chinese container customers. In Taiwan, it uses some of the services of our Chinese container terminals.

Changlong is about 5.6% of its total market industry. Our second Yangning is 2.2%. The third waning is 1.6%. That plus the twenty-first Dexiang, Dexiang has been ranked in the past year about 21, 22. The two years seem to be good, it still has a lot of volume. So it went to the global 20.

In comparison, it is said that the major carriers we speak of the top five carriers, which accounted for more than 60% of the global market to about 65% of the market share. This is one of the top 20 carriers, which is a ranking market share of the top 20 carriers. Again, let's take a look at the supply and demand section. In fact, we can see that the supply and demand of the market and its supply and demand of the market are relatively easier than the demand of the market.

We can look at why there is such a big gap between 2023 and 2024. This is mainly because in the last two or three years of the pandemic, the shipmaker has earned a lot of money because of the high shipping costs of the ocean market they have made a lot of money.

So by 2025, the total number of this ship has decreased. So, in terms of supply and demand, it may be a bit more balanced. That's when we'll see the whole supply and demand imbalance like 2015 and 2009. In 2009, 089 was the time of the entire financial crisis. Then in 2015, there was a big gap between supply and demand, which led to the whole market imbalance.

This is part of our report on the supply and demand of the entire market.

By 2024, there were many new ships. We could not find them in the hands of carriers. What we can see is that it was about. This is a ship larger than 18000tube. Last year.

Last year. Delivered about 129. More than 18000tube ships. Then. 15000 to 18000tube ships. Also delivered about 59.

A lot of new boats have been delivered. We have seen it. We have heard it in 2025. It's probably the whole story. There are about 250 ships to be delivered again.

That 2026 followed. 2027 said. There were 160 of them and 270 of them. 217 of the ships were to be delivered. That's the whole. This is probably part of the supply and demand of the sea market.

Take a look at this and see what we have to offer, and see what we have to offer and what we have to offer.

Important message. Report ahead. The first one is possible. The friction of US-China trade. This is of course for the maritime market. There is a relatively significant message.

Then again, the whole trade may have some reorganization, and there are some political uncertainties.

The other is the carrier. The part of the company. Of course, there are other parts of the company. The carbon emissions are all reported. Let's take a look at the friction between US and China trade.

That's part of the reason why it's in the U.S. because of Trump.

The following is a re-routing paragraph transcript:. That carbon emissions also has a plan. It has dominated the entire agenda of 2025. Although the specific measures for this implementation are not so clear, in the coming decades to 2050, it will have a certain set of criteria for the carrier's so-called carbon reduction.

This is the message of the market delivery. It is a good conclusion to all of you. We just mentioned that there are many factors that can affect the entire shipping market, such as the recovery of the stock economy of the tariff policy. These can have some impact on the entire shipping market. But for now, the biggest impact is what we call the so-called tariff policy of the United States.

This is until the results of tariff negotiations between various U.S. countries and the U.S. will continue. Of course, during this consultation, he will also have some policies and measures to respond to the results of this so-called change in the entire tariff agreement. For now, let's take a look at how the entire maritime market affects more or just the Asia and the U.S. routes I mentioned.

So there is no new oath in the U.S. two days before that. I think this is a sign of some relatively good ways to talk about tariffs. This land should continue to develop in a good direction. In addition to the geopolitical part of the tariff policy we have just talked about, but it still affects some shipping companies.

But here will increase the cost of some shipping. But in addition to these factors, there are some changes in the weather in some ports in Europe that can cause a surge. The port swimming cottages are not really related. These in the short term will have some impact on some markets, but some of them will also have some contingency measures. We just talked about the operators themselves with some flexible strategies to adjust some areas of their operations.

They will then also have some strategic alliances to increase some cooperation with the International Alliance to address this short-term change in the market. Therefore, a prudent and optimistic attitude of our industry for the whole long-term or long-term is to take a look at some of the changes in the medium-to-long-term maritime markets.

Keelung Port Corporation is renovating Pier No. 20. It is the original plan of Keelung Port Corporation. It is not related to the accident that struck our company with the scheduled launch of the cruise ship. The port company's plan for renovating the terminal during this period has been negotiated by the company. The port company has agreed to waive the pier trip during the construction period, and the reserved pier trip plan has been negotiated by the company during that period.

The first quarter of that year was around 1900 million. So the three reasons mentioned above were the result. The first quarter of this year was a significant difference compared to the first quarter of last year. That was the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year. That was the comparison table for the previous quarter.

As you can see below, there is a significant growth in the earnings of basic US stocks. There is a significant change compared to last year's low interest rate. Pre-tax net profit, an increase of 552% from last year's low interest rate.

Gross margin decreased by about 20.3%. Four main reasons were the most significant. The first was the reduction in the frontline occupancy of the pier by about 7.5%.

There are also two interest experience commodity CFS warehouses and the number of differential electricity that is frozen and expensive. Because this is industry characteristics. This is usually the first quarter of our traditional low season. In addition, there are Chinese New Year holidays. Therefore, rental days will decrease relatively.

The second reason is last year's fourth quarter. That's why we increased the cost of shipping by approximately 37 million. This year's fourth quarter also increased the cost of shipping by about 26 million.

The third reason is that Hong Kong and Macau companies are renovating the Pier 20. He has reduced our company's rent and management fees. Last year's reduction was around 20 million. This year's reduction was about 19 million.

The fourth reason is. There was an accident in the fourth quarter last year due to a planned pilot who hit us. So we had a scrap. We had a scrap. We had a scrap of the entire province. The economy of scraping Joskie. His economic loss was about 64 million.

This happened in the fourth quarter of last year. So you can see the previous quarter's pre-tax experience. There are other U.S. stock gains that are far worse than the fourth quarter of last year. The main reason is because of this accident.

The chart is based on the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2025. The current ratio of each quarter is also subject to changes in the debt ratio. The green discount chart above is the current ratio. The current ratio of each quarter is likely to remain below 100.

That was a significant decline compared to the 132% quarter. But it still remained at a relatively high level compared to the previous quarter. The reason for that decline was because of the liquidity in the first quarter of this year. A significant decrease compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

The main reason for that decrease is because of our first quarter of this year. There are more capital expenditures. Advance payments. This leads to a significant increase in the amount of our prepaid equipment.

The blue discount chart below is the debt ratio. The debt ratio of each quarter is expected to remain stable at around 70%. The debt ratio in recent quarters is still seen as a slowdown. Because we used it before.

If we don't take into account the impact of the APP16 rental certificate rapid storm. Our company's real debt ratio should be around 46% to 54%. This is still a reasonable and stable state. That figure is from Q1 2023 to Q1 2025. The consolidated revenue for each quarter. There are also changes in gross and net profit margins.

The straight chart in light blue is a consolidated revenue. Quarterly revenues may vary. However, it remains stable. The consolidated revenue in the first quarter of 2025 was 7.7 billion. This is a bit more effective than before. I just mentioned it mainly because of the industry characteristics.

The first quarter is a traditional low season. The number of rental days is relatively small. Therefore, compared to the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter. There will be relatively recessions. You can see the previous situation.

The above red line chart is the gross profit margin. The gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2025 is 14.9%. Compared to the previous one, the decrease is mainly due to the traditional low season factor of our industry characteristics. The dark blue line below is the net profit margin. The net profit margin for the first quarter of 2025 is 4.2%.

The results of the net profit causes in the fourth quarter. We had a planned start-up accident in the fourth quarter of last year. The company currency situation. If the EY incident is stated. The company currency situation. The company has a negative impact on the operation of the wealth.

So in order to balance this shareholder interest, we have a negative impact on the company. That chart is the first quarter of 2025. The consolidated revenue for each quarter. The consolidated revenue for each quarter. The straight chart in light blue is the consolidated revenue.

Quarterly revenue. As you can see. Quarterly revenue. The red line chart above is gross profit margin. Gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2025 is 14. 9%. Mainly because of our industry characteristics.

So.

That other disclosure is to disclose some of the major shareholders' information. You can see the top right of this, our main four shareholders, the percentage of the majority of our holdings. There are four major shareholders, which is about 44. 88%, compared to the 49. 74% of the first quarter of last year, which is about 4.86 percent. The main reason for that reduction is because we can see that the second largest shareholder is Fuwang investment, because the company has some financial planning, so they reduce the shareholding.

The proportion of the person and foreign investors is due to changes in corporate ownership, and there is a slight increase. Personal growth from 32.7 to 36.5, the foreign investment slightly increased to 2.7%. That just mentioned is that the majority of corporate shareholders are our second largest shareholder Fuwang investment, and there are some financial planning, so the number of holdings is reduced early.
