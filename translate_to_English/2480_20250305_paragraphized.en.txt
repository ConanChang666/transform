Welcome to the online corporate briefing for the fourth quarter of 113. Today's speakers are Vice President of the company, Xu Ruihua, and Vice President of Huang Xinqi. Next, I will pass my time to the company.

I am Mr. Xu Ruihua, the spokesperson of Dunhua Technology Co., Ltd. Today, I am the Vice President of our company, Mr. Huang Xinqi, to open the fourth quarter of the legal person briefing session for you.

Good for you, good for you, good for you, good for you, great for you.

We also have to say it again. Some of the words of our company. Founded in 82 89. Listed in 1990. The number of current employees. About 613.

It is one of the largest information system integration service providers in China. It is then one of the 500 largest companies in the domestic service industry. The current customer base should then be more than 1600. Then the agent has more than 40 internationally renowned information products and solutions. The company's vision is to help our customers become information service providers. Our 10th Corporate Governance Evaluation is between 21 and 35.

There are a few examples of what we have on the client. We have in each bank Fubon funds. We all have a vendor that is evaluated as good. But because we have some other vendors, we cannot be made public.

There are a few examples of what is good and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is evil, and what is good, and what is evil, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good, and what is good?

Awards received in 23 years 24 years 25 years. Included in Nanova at Ivan at Sysco. At HPE. There are also some in Dell. Best. Cooperation awards.

Here is the storage here. In VMWay. There are also other Vims in NetApp. We also have some of them here. The progressive prize is also some of the best in the Platinum. The Partner Award.

In the Garden of Gethsemane there is a new creation, and in the Garden of Gethsemane there is a new creation; and in the Garden of Gethsemane there is a new creation, and in the Garden of Gethsemane there is a new creation.

It's a security product here at Strike. CowStrike is here for us. It's one of the best in three years.

Parlato also has Sytris and Sysco. We have one of the best service awards we have ever had. This security product is a lot of ours. There are still those that continue to be awarded. T5 F5 and CheckPoint Cisco. Parlato OpenTex Portinet are the annual award-winning pilots.

There are other integration awards. Ubuntu and HPE. Dell ASC are also awards. There are also excellent awards for service. Good thing we have this security product here at Crowstrike. We've been acting as an agent for years.

That's the picture on the right. This is their official website. It's just inside the official website. We only have Dunyang Technology on their official website. It's also the only company in Taiwan that has a good show on its official website. This is because we worked with him as a first-ever company. We now work with him as a company.

It's very good. Then we're also very good at the above. So we call it Taiwan's only company on the official website. A company that can be put up. Here at the security management system. We've got ISO 27001.

In 2022, 2023 and 2019, this part. There are 27701. These are all certified. Our current locations. Headquartered in Taiwan in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Then we have our branches.

Taoyuan, Taipei, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Hualien. There are eight locations in Taiwan. There are three locations in mainland China. There are Suzhou, Shanghai, and berths. There is one location in Vietnam.

This is where we have so many places to do business right now. Well, we talk about the marketing part of our company. On the marketing organization. We are probably differentiated by region and industry. Like our first business group, this business unit. We are responsible for high-tech industries, e-commerce, finance, etc.

Automotive, government, education. Its main area is in Hsinchu and Central Taiwan. The second business group is also mainly in high-tech manufacturing. And then there is defense, military, transmission, education, and medical care.

The main areas are Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Central Taiwan and South Taiwan. The fifth business group is information security. It serves all kinds of industries in Taiwan. It is the fifth business group. The sixth business group is finance, insurance, telecommunications, small and medium enterprises.

The main areas are in Taipei and Eastern Taiwan. The eighth business group is mainly in private telecommunications, film and television media, energy and hydropower. The main areas are in Taipei. The ninth business group is mainly in Chunghwa Telecom.

Then I asked Mr. Huang to explain to everyone that we are involved in the application services. Hello fellows, I'm a yellow week, I'm a bad boy also have cold, but not passed by blood.

I don't know if you can see this clearly. It should be possible. The light yangke seems to follow you all. It's a career in the information service industry.

We focus on some technologies. Whether technology or products. I think it's about IT. Information Technology. CT Communication. OT. All three of us do it.

As for what is covered in these three things. This figure can be roughly explained. The middle part is probably the part of the application. The most. The most. The most. The most. most commonly used application architecture.

Most of them are already voice services. Except for enterprise personalization applications. Outside of their landing. There are now many public services. Or many private businesses to do IT CT OT services outside of the office. They are already on top of voice.

Whether it's a hybrid or a civilization, or a dedicated public above to do such an application, these applications must be some of the drivers to trigger these applications.

It can be booming. That's my left. These participants included. Enterprise factory. He may need such an application. His application may be available to his Consumer.

He is the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, the one who gives the gift of life, and the one who gives the gift of life.

This is the part of the network I have mentioned below, which is probably what I can imagine in Telecommunication, Data Communication, Proband, and Internetworking, are all the networks from end-to-end to end. Then again, the part that it is delivered to the terminal is that it is likely to be delivered to the enterprise's personal computer, or not to the family, or some SMP personal computer. Then we can imagine that everyone has a mobile device, whether it is a PAD or a phone.

At the bottom is our IT technology display, including the network, including Compute, we are talking about computing the CPU GPU, etc. Now the CPU GPU may be operated by a virtual machine or by a container, or by a single machine, whether it is a cloud or a hybrid cloud, or in the environment of the customer's home, probably these organizations.

So I'd like to point out a few things: AI is what we do with AI, how we do it with AI, why we do it with Cloud, and why we do it with Cloud, etc. It's probably three, and security is what we call it so very much, and we're all very concerned about. AI has been doing it for a long time, and we're not, we're often visited, and we've been asked how many of the advanced doors tell us how much AI is in our company. In fact, it's hard to take it to talk about, because it's really hard to use the CPU, because some different applications, different calculations can use the CPU, there are a lot of the CPU. So we've got to do AIInfrastructure, is its infrastructure, we help our customers to build the framework of the software that they need to use, and then we can help it all the data integration, and then we can help data scientists to normalize it all the data.

So the left infrastructure has been doing a lot of things, big and small, like the one that's so big, we're also making small customers to start a trial, we're doing this one. There are two pieces on the right, and we're talking about NVIDIA. NVIDIA AI Foundry is just an example, we're not only NVIDIA's AI Foundry, we have IBM's Wastenet, we're now the whole framework of DeepSync, and we're covering it here. What do we do with this part?

So customers want to do AI, you can come in here to see what you want to do, whether I already have an existing Inference, or have an existing Inference that you can train yourself home, or directly have an existing Inference that you can import, etc. We are very familiar with this type of ecosystem, can help our guests, when you want to do AI, it is an Approach, I can help you see whether you can use it, no.

We don't have to find a model available. Then we help you normalize your data. Then start training. This is part.

Then there is the collaboration of ownership. Some guests are more concerned about his business logic. He wants to do the AI business logic. That is their Idea. Tell me.

Because we are a business after all. A commercial company. So they compare Refer to the research community. We also work with the research community for a very long time. That is, we can Bridge them. We can still provide him with AI-related Infrastructure.

These are the underlying infrastructure of the hardware and software. Build it up. Then Bridge these customers follow the research community. Do what they want to do. This is probably AI. That's what we're seeing now.

It should be booming. And thanks to China. Good death made a deep city to run. A lot of people never thought of it, because it might be too high to progress. Already wanted to try.

That's why we need so much. We can also help our guests. That's what I just said. Because I'm on top of this. We can help our guests. Whether you're using NVIDIA or using IBM.

We can all help him. Even help him structure the whole framework of Deep City. Automate his AI. He builds it with Float. Teach him how to do it. Training for Prompting in his own domain.

This Prompting Engineering. For example, he is a do-it-yourself. That do-it-yourself. That do-it-yourself. There are many things you can automate. You can use AI to do a lot of things for you.

You will learn from him, and we will help you to do so, and it will be easier for you to do so.

Then again, security. The road is high. It looks like this. From my point of view, I want to run for a while. I just mentioned the launch of Deep City. It's really good to run.

I had an IBM AI Seminar a few years ago. I went to Open. I already mentioned this situation. Like this GenAI. The language model was after the launch. In fact, these language models.

There is a thing called Azure Guidelines. It is a framework of morality. This moral framework is to tell the language model. When the user is asking you how to make a C4 Bomb, or teach me how to make ice poison.

You can't tell him, but you know it, or you want to buy a gun to kill him, or you want to do a fishing trick.

All you want to get is Deep City. CheckGPT Google Gemini. They all know it. They all know it. But they all have an ethical framework.

Frame him. You can't do this. But once it's done, I've tried it myself. I've got an open source model. Remove it from this moral framework.

"I will call upon him, and he will answer me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him."

The bad guys use AI as well. The bad guys show him doing bad things. So the competition defense. Attacking the defense continues to happen. That's very likely to happen here. We mainly use hacker to go to electronic hackers.

There are many of us in the world who have a lot of things to do, and those who have a lot to do with it, and those who have a lot to do with it, and those who have a lot to do with it, and those who have a lot to do with it, and those who have a lot to do with it.

No matter what you do to protect it. He thinks about how hackers think about it. How does this hacker attack? This NG firewall. How do you attack this database system. How do you attack this web page.

Then he went on to say, "This is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it; this is the way, walk in it."

I'm going to say this first. I'm mainly talking about this MDR section. There are a few recently. It's not that hospital. It's a really bad hacker.

And he said unto them, Behold, this is my body which is broken for two years, and this is my body which is broken for two years; and this is my body which is broken for two years; and this is my body which is broken for two years.

There are many who have gone before them, and have gone before them, and have gone before them, and have gone after them, and have gone before them, and have gone after them, and have gone after them, and have gone after them, and have gone after them.

Next, let's talk about the anti-virus wall. The anti-virus wall is no longer blocked. Now use EDR. This is using a lot of AI technology. There are also machine learning techniques to analyze.

It doesn't work. It's going to be tough. We've seen a few of these cases. The hospital is the only one with this problem.

So Dunyangke has been doing MDR for a long time. The EDR has been doing for a long time. Our EDR factor is more than 100,000 times. Did you know that the vice president of the song mentions quite a cross track.

There will be good and bad. But it is in this EDR area. It is the number one. We not only have this cross track. We also have Parlato Cortex. It is also the number one product.

So we are in this part. We all have the EDR CDR part in the Cloud. The MDR part of the network. There is also the MDR part, and then do the MDR. This is probably the safe part.

I'm going to say one more thing, but it's really interesting.

Now I want to ask our Hacker. Go to the dark web for a little bit. You can target a company. If you specify which company to look for, you can find a little bit more. You can find that company.

There may be some accounts that are leaked out. This is not the case, so this is also common. Therefore, all companies want to protect the assets. The first thing is to keep the account private.

This is going to take a lot of effort. Do a very Robust account management. Otherwise, it will be stolen once it is stolen. Next step is to do the next attack. This part is what we do with the security service management framework. Most of us have just mentioned a lot of it.

In addition to customization. Discipline a wide range of products. Network products. How the application can be taught. Includes scanning of code. Security of endpoints and more.

The security of mobile devices. They are all part of this commuting. In addition, we can develop after the system is launched. Or before. These security checks are then provided in a wide range of ways, including LOSR.

It is VA. Penetration test PD. Coreview code detection. Then do MDR. Then do IR. The so-called accident investigation.

When you are in the middle of an event, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it, when you are in the middle of it.

How did you come up with this, and how did you come up with it, and how did you come up with it, and how did you come up with it, and how did you come up with it?

And it shall come to pass, that, as it is written, [that] I will go to the house of the LORD, and will go to the house of the LORD: and I will go to the house of the LORD: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD: and I will dwell in the midst of the midst of them: and I will dwell in the midst of them: and I will dwell in the midst of them: and I will dwell in the midst of them.

Because I don't have enough resources, I may call the API to code. Go to HBD code GMLI. This API gives you home. If it's not safe, what should I do? So this is going to be tested.

This is SCOCA. SCOCA is probably now used. That is, it is getting more and more powerful. Even if there is a government announcement. To use this Security SCOCA. Go to verify.

Vendors to bid. Their security risk coefficient is high or low. If its security risk coefficient is high, it may not let it enter the bid. There are also some like our customers.

They will also use this to gather this stuff. Its suppliers. Our company's score in Mt. Fuji is 99 points. One percent. So we're working hard on this part of the asset. I don't say much.

"This is a great place for us to get to know each other," he said, "and we have a lot to do with it, and we have a lot to do with it," he said, "and we have a lot to do with it.

One is content security. Two main pieces of professional service are service. The so-called network security is access. I let you access this. Don't let it go this way.

This is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked.

But you can only go somewhere. For example, you can only go to the 3rd room on the 2nd floor. Maybe you can only read the e-mail. You can only do some transfer of files.

There are NG Firewalls on the left. There are EDI NDR CDRs, etc. Or privileged account management is accessible. You can't access it. Zero trust processing. This is also a big area.

The threshold for content security is relatively high. It has a relationship with the application. It has a relationship with the database. So its stuff will be more advanced professional occupational safety consultants. To deal with things here. Probably some of the services or products it represents.

This is similar to SIEM API Security. If you don't see Coding, how do you see the API?

This is the gate between the Software Engineer. In this case, we must know that both of us can do this.

Web Application Firewall. It is a security service with a higher level of content-related thresholds. Nowadays, many companies use web pages for the first door to do business. It is the transmission of business information. Or to do some data exchange.

Even trading. Especially trading. This involves money. It's not a joke. So Web Application Firewall has a relationship with the software.

The information is just about to be reported to you. We will rely on the source of this information. We will have a wide range of security equipment to teach us about the data we sell. Even the security software system. We have this latest information.

He just developed a Zero-Day tag. To attack an industry. We get this message. We're going to target this data. What kind of process does he do. Generate a Configuration.

We have the assets of our clients. This is a function of CGI. Then Security Scorecard just talked about. Send automation. Large companies may be able to use it.

There are a lot of people. There are many factories. There are many offices. There are many buildings. There are a lot of buildings.

There are many companies that have a lot of people out there running around. For example, Taiwanese in the United States, it is safe to let him borrow money back to the company's resources, so it is a function. There are many companies that have a lot of people out there running around. The professional service is the VAP, the IR you mentioned just now, the Coreview MBR, and so on.

These companies have all served, some of which can be ordered from one million to billions, one order, so these companies have all served. Our main here is to provide the middle blue part of the customer. Some companies have already served our existing customers, when the needs of these clouds, whether it is completely moved to the top of the cloud, we have a few cases of this, after all, are two generations of customers, especially like the entire Migrate to the cloud. We also have such a guest, but most of them use hybrid cloud architecture.

So this part of us is probably this, and then 5G AI plus edge cloud, I've been talking about it for years now, and now I can speak louder. Whether it's NVIDIA or DeepSync, I'm on my iPhone, I have an iPhone16 Pro, and I've installed a 1.5B DeepSync model on it. I'm not using the cloud first, I'm using my own phone on it, I can, a LMN, a small real six model.

There are a lot of different kinds of devices, in addition to Telco Telecom's own service application, it also leases to other, and also to do AR VR's GAM, which makes it possible to put it on top of H, which is related to AI. When it doesn't understand and throws it back, it can be re-trained when it throws it back, or it's a smaller model. It can be done in LocalRAN, and then it can be done for Prompting, and then it can be improved.

This is also the case now that this part of the process is normalized by 5G plus AI edge, which is sure to be better. Well, this is our solution to and from the product, about six pieces. Software development, all the major companies associated with AI, they are vigorously pushing, as well as AWS, or IBM, Microsoft, and the other main lower level, this Lazarus. This is a good start for a startup in the United States, they are in the defense, in this half of the finance, this very superior level, this is a product of our agency, we are currently doing some relatively large projects. Very large projects, the part of the network, there are telecommunications networks and data networks.

The data network was just mentioned by Vice President Xu, and there were a lot of awards, such as Cisco, Sysco, HP, etc., and then to telecommunications networks, and now only with one company, Nokia. Nokia is also the world's largest, it is probably Dominant, probably Dominant's telecommunications network. Basically, all is it. So the rest is zero, it's in this industry.

Well, let's take a look at last year's balance sheet. Here I would like to tell you a bit more down because we bought a warehouse, we bought a warehouse, and we bought a warehouse in Hsinchu. Then look at our stock, there are more growth. All of these are already orders, our stock, this is an overview of our future quarters.

So this inventory is probably a good thing to do in the next two quarters of the year. Then take a look at our watertight table, where our revenue is slightly higher than the previous year's 112-year growth.

The gross profit margin is the same, and then the cost is a little more, because the revenue growth is a little more. Then overall, the surplus is a little more than 112 years. That China subsidiary in our entire revenue, probably a little more than a percentage, is a very small revenue in China. Well, let's look at the comparison of our entire revenue, we look at QOQ here, our fourth quarter grew by 26.7% compared to the third quarter, the whole year from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter, grew by 3.3%, and then in the whole year, YY we grew by 3.7%, which is part of the revenue.

Well, let's take a look at our operating expenses, the operating expenses of our company is really very strict control, so the cost of this side of the difference is not very, in the management and research and development costs here to take a look at the management cost of 113 in the fourth quarter is 23830 yuan, 239 million, R & D costs are 234 million, total is 26182 million, this part is a little growth than the third quarter of the 113 year is a little, then the fourth quarter of the 112 year is a decline of 0,8%, that is a little, the whole year is a little more 4.8%, this is likely.

We are looking at three years of revenue growth and net profit, each year there is growth, regardless of revenue or net profit after tax, we are growing every year. Next, US stock earnings, US stocks from 110 years of comparison, the share capital is also growing, that is, there is no change, we can look at our ROE, ROE in 113 years is a small decline. This one is to show that we have so far in the hand order, we are in the hand order, we see the bottom right of this column, 113 years of Q4 is at the end of the year, we have 74 billion hands, look at that green part, that is 81. 23%, there are 6 billion billion billion, after 114 years of this money will be completed in 114 years, about 1.4 billion, this is in the fourth season, this is in the hand an order of an order. We look at this, if we only divide it, sell products and services, labor income in these two pieces, our total income in this situation, the whole total income can see us, information repair accounted for our largest part, then there are computer software and network products, storage equipment workstation, etc., that 113 years compared to 112 years, only in the product sales part is growth, it reaches 5.1 billion Oh, then the labor service part is nearly 2.4 billion, then in 112 years, the hardware sales is 4.8 billion, in the software service is 2.4 billion, this is the whole sales situation.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read carefully the rules provided by the user to ensure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them verbatim to make sure that nothing is missing. Next, I will analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

First of all, I need to identify the subject of each paragraph. For example, the segmented revenue section includes the percentage of different industries, then the three-year comparison, then the regional income, and then the future outlook and Q&A session. Each section may need to be divided into different paragraphs, but the order and content of the original sentence must be maintained. In the process, it is necessary to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is in the correct position. For example, [2627. 80-2630. 80] to [2655. 80-2658. 80] is about segmented revenue, and then the three-year comparison, then the regional income, and the final Q&A section. I need to keep the original order of each sentence.

In addition, questions and answers in the Q&A session also need to be retained as they are, to ensure continuity of the conversation. During the processing process, there may be some duplicate or redundant sentences, such as "good enough" appearing multiple times, but according to the rules, all must be retained. Therefore, I need to make sure that these transitional words are correctly placed in the paragraph without affecting the overall readability. Finally, check that the entire finishing transcripts comply with the user's requirements: do not delete any sentences, keep the original intention, paragraphs clear.

In summary, the steps include: 1. Identify the topics of each part; 2. Segmentation by logic; 3. Preserve all original sentences; 4. Check the format and order. Ensure that the final output meets all the requirements of the user. </think> [paragraph transcription]: Well, let's take a look at the industry.

Transportation is 9%, financial insurance is 9%, biomedical is 5%, and other industries account for 8%. This is a revenue situation for the entire industry. Well, let's look at the comparison of three years. 3 years compared electronics, the industry of the electronic chain, from 51% to 42%, and then back to 45%. What kind of industry will increase? Let's look at the government part of the increase, from 12 to 11 to 13, so the government education unit is a part of the increase.

The blue part is financial insurance, it falls from 10% to 9%, it is a small fortune recession. The green part is other industries, the purple part is biomedical, biomedical has grown from 10% to 5%. This is a situation in our industry. Well, let's look at the U.S., a revenue from a region, that is, we Taiwan still occupy a very big part of us.

This is probably a situation in another region. Well, let's take a look at what we have seen in the past three quarters, that is, in the hundred quarters of our revenues. That's right, this curve is uh, the scale is not much, until the fourth quarter of 113 is uh, the best quarter of the three years have been uh, uh, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hm, hm, hmmm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm,

I don't know if you have any questions about us, thank you for the presentation of the two vice presidents. Next time we will talk about the problem. Welcome to the online investment advanced can eh, open the microphone question directly, you can also leave your questions in the chat room, you are welcome to ask questions. Well, the 2025 year boom, we feel eh, eh, this industry just like we said eh, eh, eh, it's a breakthrough new thing in the information industry because we see every time we talk about it, it's a new thing in the information industry.

So because of this, because of these uh, new things come out of everyone to try, so of course, he has to change his hardware architecture or software, etc. So for us this industry, of course, there will be damage, so we see, the second-year industry, 2025 is also a good year. I think that 2025 should be, it will be good, it should not be comparable, it should grow than 2024, this is what it looks like now.

So what you see is the growth of computer software, should be all kinds of industry, because there is information security software there is. That is the impact on gross profit margin, just one software, I can't see, but I think it should be positive, eh it should not be too big, too low, so this year should continue to grow. Is there any answer to the above question?

That section of the page slide, do we have a special highlight that the green part belongs to 114 and 115 years to continue to fulfill the part? Is that right? So after adding the green, if divided by 2 average, that is, the future 114 to 114 years, at least 78 billion, but because this part has not finished this part has been rolling, so I want to understand is that if so, if it is more than 78 billion, then back to the general 4% growth, then you are in the hand order now...

This is the first question I have to answer first. The number you see above is already written, so we have to calculate the hand order to the end of the fourth quarter, there are 74 billion on the hand order. In that 74 billion, of course, there are some things we haven't completed in the year, some things we haven't implemented yet, because we have some things we say are two years of warranty or four years of warranty, so some orders are things we want to perform in the next year, so we will do later.

But you started in the fourth quarter of the year 112, until the fourth quarter of 113, the middle part of the process has a green part, so I would say that this green part of all the things to sum up, add up to the 60.500 million, 60. 55 plus 762. I explained this chart, I explained. He said that the time of the year the moment, a uh number for example, 113 years Q1, then the hand order was 57 billion, where he had some numbers to execute in the next year, so you can only look at that moment, where some things were 114.

It is not a country, it is not. 113 did not end in 113 years? 113 years Q3, he was the number of the order at that time, it was the number of the time, he had 6.5 billion hands to execute at that time, then divided into 112 years, with the 100113 years and 114 years to execute some of what, so you understand what it means?

I don't know if that's the case, but if that's not the case, I'd like to understand that we can see an incremental like this, is it a season of season 1, or you can see now, I want to see the first season, we can also know that incremental increase rate, can maintain between Q4 and Q3, is this possible? If that's not the case, it's a lot of competition, compared to a few previous quarters, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition, that's a lot of competition.

What is the best way to do this? The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe and secure manner. The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe and secure manner. The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe manner. The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe and secure manner. The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe and secure manner. The most important thing to do is to do it in a safe and secure manner.

When you think he makes money on corporate capital expenditure, he wants to buy a new one directly, will become more hardware, will not be more service. When the scenery is poor, your things may want to change in 5 years.

The following are transcripts after reordering them in the original order: If you are in good condition, you may want to change them for two or three years. So in terms of the sales part, I think it is a bit delineated. This is mainly related to the industry, or the people we sell to, or the specific products, are related.

If you don't provide its added value, of course, the hardware price will not be so big. But if you can provide a lot of professional services, of course, you can receive a relatively high profit. So we are not only selling a hardware part, we have to do a lot of integration for him, he has to do a lot of products, he has to do a lot of value for him. This is what we do with other peers we will be better at what we do with the Maori above.

If you are looking for something to sell, you don't have to find me. That's not the same thing. Well, I'm going to answer a lot of other questions, please. NISSAN from NISSAN, ask a question about the core capabilities of the company, I have a message bar, please help me take a look, I want to understand your point of view. The most important intangible asset of the system integration service provider is what it is.

So I guess the intangible asset of the service provider is that you can eliminate all kinds of gaps and red dogs between the tech developers and the tech consumers. Because they are two very different groups. So if this is the case, can you not share how Dunkin strengthens and then maintains this core ability, thank you. Our company is not a company that develops the original supply products, we are a company that has developed some solutions or products abroad, and then these products are not likely to be placed directly into a person's home, plug the power switch can be used.

So here is what you have to do with some of the services you've mentioned a lot of. The applications that are involved in this field now are very much the same. So you have a server installed, and that server is definitely connected to this network. So if you have a good network, it's also related to security. So what's next and what's related to all kinds of things is a whole body. So the real core competitiveness of the company is in this IP field, we've integrated all these core technologies.

This is one of the things I have to do today. So you just mentioned that Tonggou just explained a situation I don't know if it's a problem you're asking, for example, I'm a client of a design house dedicated to IP. Then he has a lot of design engineers, this design engineer is in the design of coding or hardware firmware. So this is their job, they are very strong in this area. So the environment they want to use with general office staff, for example, some of the Microsoft office staff to operate the quotations to hit this presentation, etc., including the tools used in this environment are completely different.

So, you may see that the design of the software is not necessarily a design or maybe a software person, but he is not the same as we just said to do these IC design. So, how do you get the consensus between the two, so it becomes that you do not understand the software. You do not know how do you know what these software people think, because he is doing the software design, and the software man does not know IT infrastructure he does not know security, and when I develop this system, I have to consider what kind of factor can let me this system not be hit when online, will not be black, will not be hacked by hackers.

This is not a matter of technology, that is, we have been operating a restaurant for decades with this ties with our customers. The biggest one is that we have been eating a restaurant for decades now. The restaurant, which provides you with all the good food, makes you earn money, so the price of the service has been getting more and more busy, so the restaurant may not do it for a long time, so we have to do it better, even if we have already made you wait for it, we have to think about something that hasn't happened before.

I won't say you're using the most up to date device, the most up to date configuration. If you do not want to do this, we will not only use our existing information security equipment to help our customers to protect, we will also monitor what is in the dark web, what is new in the dark web, we have a few examples to help our suppliers, such as a web application firewall vendor, we know more than you know, because we can not find his vulnerabilities in the dark web, we even think we will do some penetration facilities, if we are worn by these providers, we will find these providers you have trouble with your equipment, when you put it on the web, may be used by him, etc., so information security is only one of them, other than in the network management, networking, telecomcommination is the same way we can do it, so there is to do it for our customers. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. If you want to know more about it, you can use it. And he did not know that he would be able to sell it, and that he would be about a thousand pieces of him, and that he would have brought him into this company. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read carefully the user-provided rules to ensure that all sentences are not deleted, not altered, not condensed. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to pay special attention to this. Next, I will check the verbatim fragments provided by the user verbatim, identify the start timestamp of each sentence, and arrange them in chronological order.

For example, on the part of a user license subscription, from [4281. 80-4283. 80] to [4295. 80-4298. 80], these sentences can be combined into a paragraph to maintain the continuity of the context. At the same time, pay attention to the non-continuous part of the processing timestamp. For example, after [4332. 80-4334. 80], the next sentence is [4343. 80-4345. 80], and there is no content for some time in between.

In addition, terms such as "security occupation" and "ci-an" mentioned by users may need to be kept as it is, without any modifications or explanations. These terms need to be checked to ensure that there is no confusion. In the process of processing, also pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, when discussing IBM's AI technology, these sentences can be combined into a paragraph that illustrates the long-term involvement and practical application cases of IBM in the AI field. Finally, check the paragraph-based verbatim after finishing to ensure that all the original sentences are correctly arranged without missing or repetitive, and that all the user's requirements are met.

</span><span class="orgFullName-prefix">Church of Scientology</span> <span class="orgFullName-suffix">Church of Scientology</span> <span class="orgFullName-suffix">Auckland</span>

I would also like to mention IBM, this IBM is in the AI part, he is very, very long, from the previous Synla, the next one is very bad, then don't forget the IBM to forget the IBM. Now we have also used IBM's AI technology to get very large orders, but also very large companies, it is probably doing GENAI part.

We don't have any special statistics, but I think it should be about 10 percent of us, almost 10 percent, or about 15 percent. But I'd like to add to this, that's the same thing as AI. The software is similar, although it's a project, but this project will generate some other things related to ICT. If you're an example, for example, if you're going to do this, SIEN is a very complex system, it's basically a SOC of potential, a security operating center to use, it's done a big, it's a system, all kinds of civic equipment, network equipment, server equipment, etc.

In addition, we used to be a well-known mobile phone company before a company, manufacturing mobile phone company, at that time was very famous, they were once an event, we did not do security, we sold to him at that time, they found that they were not listed yet, yet released mobile data is spread abroad, so I sent a security department at that time was responsible for me, sent a Hike to do IR, the person there for more than a week, all the problems were found, then we the customer did this for more than a million businesses, a lot of things in fact, this is not related to this, so it is difficult to use 15% for this.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Thank you very much for your support. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1. Keep all original timestamps and sentences without deleting any content. 2. Reorganize the semantic content into paragraphs in chronological order and adjust the connection between statements according to semantic logic. 3. Keep all original punctuation and tone (e.g. "good" "thank you", etc.). 4. For vacancy in between the timestamps (e.g. [4332. 80-4334. 80]), skip to [4343. 80-4345. 80]), keep the vacancy according to the original data and do not supplement any content.
