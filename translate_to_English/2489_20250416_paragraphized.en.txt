<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to keep the original, just adjust the structure.

At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of the conversation and make sure the converted paragraphs are logically clear. I need to identify different subject conversion points. For example, from discussing gross profit to selling areas to inventory handling and tariff issues, these are different topics.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that sentences within paragraphs are sorted in chronological order. During the process, pay special attention to duplicate or redundant sentences, such as "area-view" appear twice, and may need to be merged. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all contents are correctly categorized.

In addition, pay attention to the oral expression, such as "that", "that", etc., these may need to be retained during the conversion in order to maintain the tone of the original words. At the same time, ensure that the technical terms such as "Gaming Monitor" are correctly presented correctly. Finally, read the whole converted paragraph type verbatim, confirm that there is no missing any sentences, structurally reasonable, in line with the user's requirements. To ensure that the sentences in each paragraph are smooth, logically coherent, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the original content.

We are going to increase our gross profit in the future, including this Gaming Monitor. Those are the ones we have a better chance of monetizing. And that's what the mouse is doing with this wireless Bluetooth, which is a good thing in moor. We're going to have a few new products coming from here. The interviewer mentioned to you about our revenue in 2020 and the point of sale area, can you help us analyze it? This is how many years in North America?

In the region, the United States is about 30%, non-US part is 70%, including Europe and China as well as Southeast Asia. What is the occupation of China? China's occupation is about, we have a guest, but the proportion is going to decline slightly this year. So there is also some migration of this area, maybe the final shipment is not necessarily in China, so we will be scattered again.

I will try to de-establish our inventory at this time, and then compare it with our customers, but I don't know what will happen after 90 days. So I think the future will still be focused on dispersion, whether it is the dispersion of the customer base, because now the U.S. customer base should not be able to run, so we have to conduct trial on this customer. The U.S. comparison is not possible, that is, to see the conclusion of the tax rate negotiations in the future.
