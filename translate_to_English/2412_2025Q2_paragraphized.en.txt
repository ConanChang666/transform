<think> Ok, now I'm going to deal with the user's request, sorting out a paragraph-by-word transcription into a readable paragraph format, and having to strictly follow the rules and cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed anything. First, I need to read through the user's transcription, understand the content of the sentence per time period, and then merge these sentences into a consistent paragraph based on semantic and contextual relationships. First, I'll read through the entire provided transcription, marking the possible segmentation points of each paragraph. For example, the initial sentence mentioned, "So the financial growth in this regard grew by 6.8%... "This information seems to be a paragraph that describes the financial growth and related context, which could be incorporated into a paragraph. Next, the introduction of the 15 items and the financial performance of the second quarter, these sentences should be a separate paragraph, as they relate to different topics.

Next, I need to make sure that the sequence of each sentence is not changed, and the combined paragraphs are naturally smooth. For example, discussions about financial growth data and indicators such as EBITDA should be grouped together to form a logical and complete paragraph. At the same time, users repeat the steps to guide the audience how to ask questions, and these duplicate information may need to be processed as separate paragraphs to maintain the original intention.

In addition, check if there is interference with timestamps to ensure that timestamps remain after conversion, but users may not need to show them, but there is no timestamp in the original data, so it may have been processed. Another point to note is that users may want the final transcription format to be more in line with the standard of written communication, rather than collation, so it is necessary to properly connect sentences, use punctuation marks and paragraph separators to enhance readability while maintaining the integrity of the original content. During processing, repeating or similar guidance may be encountered, such as repeatedly mentioning steps of pressing buttons 1 and 2, which need to be maintained to avoid merging or simplifying to ensure compliance with user requirements.

In addition, the last part of the content about the end of the meeting and thanks to the participants should be as a complete paragraph to maintain the order and content of the original. Finally, I read the finishing paragraph verbatim text, check whether all sentences have been properly merged, no omissions, and the statements are smooth, without violating the rules set by the user. At the same time, I confirm that no additional content has been added, all the data, duplicated instructions and thanks are accurately retained.

In the first half of the year, financial growth exceeded expectations. In addition, the interests of the business, the domestic industry, EBITDA and EBITDA all exceeded our internal expectations, which is better than expected, and the steady growth by our company has increased our ICT interests, as well as the strong sales of telephone and related products, and lower economic costs than expected.
