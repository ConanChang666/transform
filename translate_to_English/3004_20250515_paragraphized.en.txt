<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the provided transcription fragments to see if there are duplicates or obvious errors. For example, around timestamp [86. 42-87.42], I will repeat "What is our part on this project?" for several consecutive times, which may be an error or technical issue, but according to the user's request, I must keep the original word, so that it cannot be deleted or modified. Next, I need to re-arrange the verbose transcription in logical and time order into paragraphs. Usually, the structure of the meeting or speech will have openings, introduction, subject content, financial reports, Q&A sections, etc. I need to identify these sections and categorize the relevant sentences into the corresponding paragraphs.

For example, the beginning part includes greetings and introductions to attendees, which should be merged into a paragraph. Then the company profile and business introduction, followed by financial data and product applications, and finally the preparation of Q&A sessions. It is necessary to pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the content is coherent. At the same time, pay attention to the accuracy of the timestamps to ensure that the position of each sentence is correct.

In addition, the user mentions "not to delete any sentences, not to sum up", so even if some sentences are duplicated or redundant, it must be retained. For example, repeating "the current number of 888" and "the more 800 divided into about 580 in Taiwan" repeatedly, all of which need to be retained in paragraphs. During the processing process, also pay attention to the correct use of punctuation and formatting to ensure that the paragraphs are separated by line, but the sentences remain as they should be. For example, the sentences after timestamps should be coherent, without adding additional punctuation, unless the original text has been in them.

We would like to introduce you to our meeting management team today, the general manager, Mr. Lin Weichun, and the chief executive officer, Mr. Li Wenzheng. Next is the presentation time of the company, and we will ask the management team to present the results of the first quarter of the operation for you.

This is a disclaimer, let's take a look at it. The report is divided into two sections, one is the operating report, and the explanation of finance. So I will spend more time with you today, I know you want a lot of questions, then I will spend more time with you. So these two reports will be explained by me.

Let us begin with a statement about our operations. What are we in this section? What are we in this section? What are we in this section? What are we in this section? What are we in this section? What are we in this section? What are we in this section?

What is this part of our project? What is this part of our project? What is this part of our project? What is this part of our project? What is this part of our project?

What is our part of this project? What is our part of this project? Is the 2002 izz, the current capital is 5.7 billion, the main shareholders are miracle technology. The current number of 888, the current number of 888, the current number of 888. The more 800 divided into Taiwan about 580, the more 800 divided to Taiwan about 580, the more 800 divided to Taiwan about 580. China about 260, China about 260.

Nearly 40 of our employees, nearly 50, are one of our new Malaysian companies. Revenue was combined in 2024 by 35,200 million, with the main products or fasteners used in aircraft. I think the fasteners we said were a little more precise, which should be used in aircraft engines. This is used more and more, and then the racks, forging parts, and the fasteners for cars. You can see that some of our three factories in Taiwan are located in three factories, one factory, two factory, and three factories in Pingzhen. Kunshan is still a factory, and then this is the part of Malaysia, which I will explain more about the current situation in Malaysia factory.

I just mentioned our company's main products or products used on aircraft engines. At present, the four major engine manufacturers in the world, GE, the U.S. bone painting, RosLois in the UK, and the French Safran Engine Club, are Fonda's customers. Of course, the final aircraft is already assembled on Boeing and Airbus' aircraft. In addition to these four customers, of course, there are some other parts of TL1 of these four customers, including TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1 of TL1, such as Avio, MOC, CORIANS, TRIANF, MTU, GK HONEYWELL, etc.

I think most of the Fonda's products are in the air right now. I'm talking about the first part of a single-channel aircraft, and of course the biggest part of CNN's Lip, this engine is certainly known for the G37 MAX, A320, and China C919. The other part of the short-range technology used by Bambadia Ebrenna is the CFN machine, and the other part of the short-range technology used by the Bambadia Ebrenna, there are 3.4 and the old CFN56 CFN56 CFN56 CFN56 CFN56 CFN34 CMZ, CFN34 CMZ, CFN34, old C37 CFN56 C37. The other part of the two-channel, the Boeing MAX, 777 MAX, 787 GNX, GP7200, G90 CF6, etc.

In addition to that, the whole Fonda product is in the application part, I think the biggest of course or the aviation part uses a lot of products. The other part of the space also, the other on the ground, for example, said this dedicated brand engine ah, etc. power plant, and the other part of the ocean part is the engine used by the ship, this is also the part of the application of the aircraft, I think of the engine part just mentioned the landing system, flying the system these are the whole aspects of the application of aviation. The part of the car we still focus on some of the design of more customized automotive products fasteners. This is one of the applications that Fonda has always wanted to take over the car fasteners, especially in recent years may be more applied to this new energy vehicle.

The Q1 this year Q1 has reached a single quarter of 9.3 billion, which is the situation of Q1 this year. Of course, we look at the Q1 situation of several products, the tire fasteners accounted for about 56%, the part of the tire sales machine accounted for about 33%, and the part of the industrial car in about 11%. I think the number of new products has been a more important part of the development of the company, because the development will lead to a growth of the entire company in the next 10 years.

So we will also focus on the number of developments within the company on the part of a development above. As of the first quarter, more than 130 projects have been recertified by the customer.

Of course, I will actively expand the whole production capacity and a level of technology to provide a variety of products and services to my customers. Of course, the changing needs of the market, we want to ensure that the customer can have good quality and the whole service. Of course, we have to prioritize the development of flight safety-related and relatively high-quality products, which is a focus. Of course, after the epidemic, we focus on intelligent manufacturing, improve production efficiency, control the level of products, control the quality of this quality level and optimize the manpower configuration.

Of course, there is an intelligent management, while there are some tools that improve productivity, including quality and customer service. This year, the company will pay particular attention to AI-like applications, as well as the applications on human-robot robots, and this part of the company will also focus on an investment in this area.

In fact, this type of product has a common characteristic, that is, it needs to be used forging, so in 2019 we developed forging into a company's core technology ability. Using forging we do a lot of different development, the size of the product from small to large, whether the screw is good, the screw is also good, the machine tool parts is also from small to large, so by forging we expand the scope of the whole product parts, the size of the range also adds a combination of different products with its diversity. Of course, through intelligent manufacturing, including the automation of parts of these automation parts AI forging, etc., to improve the efficiency of the company's whole production, and a product quality.

We use forging to enhance the competitiveness of GIGABYTE, using forging to do some of the products we do more, using forging to make some of the projects that are different from the product category we do. Nut parts, these are probably one of the features of some of the more traditional nuts in the past: the twelve-horn nut, the Eleven-horn nut, the Bearow, the Gang Channel, the floating nut, and so on.

This is the basis of using industrial car pull caps to apply them to aviation. So using a background of such a technology, we have developed new applications that are differently built on the air. The development of these new products that were printed to the previous pages is focused on relatively niche-based products, which means that its threshold is relatively high, and the competition in the market is relatively small.

In fact, the parts of Toyota, which we have done in Taiwan, we have done in Japan as an example of this engine. After we did, in fact, part of it was sent to the US G1, to the US G1, to the US G1 for assembly, and the other part was sent to France Sai Fung to assemble, and then we set up the engine and then send it to various fields. Of course, the part of the plane, especially on this so-called neon alloy, I think you have a lot of people concerned about the issue of tariffs, and in fact, these things are on the basis of the so-called equivalent tariffs, in fact, exemptions, because the aviation is in the case of the 737 model, which the French engine is a low-cost part.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. In the United States is a low pressure part. The high pressure part is made in the United States. So, the final assembly for the 737 is in the United States. So Sai Fung sent his engine to the United States G1 to do the assembly. So if it is the Airbus part, the reverse for the 320.

The U.S. will deliver to France after the final assembly in France, which is called Airbus. So, in fact, this part is actually rotating around the world. So of course, including the Boeing Airbus or the G1 has recently been working with the U.S. government to promote the invitation to return to the year of 19, which should be 1979, on the WTO architecture, they have become a so-called "global aviation parts" and tariffs. So you're talking about this, of course, in principle, the entire tariff section, in the wind blows, our trading conditions don't have to bear any tariffs.

First of all, we will continue to deepen the academic integration of the whole academic system, and control the cost of quality. If we shorten the delivery time and meet the needs of our customers, then I will use some more flexible methods, such as our production equipment, a more flexible part of the production base. Now I have Taiwan I have China I have Malaysia, then we will do some adjustments between these Secs. For example, when Trump first made an adjustment, we moved from China to Taiwan, then to Malaysia's tribe, we recently made an adjustment, we will slowly move more US-based things into the development of our European customers, and we will focus on the parts of China.

This is a more flexible part of the whole production base. Of course, expanding the whole digital and intelligent manufacturing part, we are going to optimize the product intelligent technology part, which includes the entire company is doing some sort of mixing of technical data, how to make it a big data fix to use the future development.

In the next 20 years, of course, the demand for the whole aviation must continue to grow, I think, this is just a reference for everyone. In the number of operations, the RPK is still growing. So the delivery of the aircraft to you a reference is that Airbus and Boeing, they added a total of 766 in 2024, the Boeing 350, I think you should also know that in the third quarter of last year, because the whole Boeing included the supply chain problems, in fact, the third quarter, is almost a short down situation, so this part also affects its own output. So of course, it is slowly recovering. So Airbus handed out 134, the Boeing handed 130, the expected part, they expected to reach the Boeing is 610, the Airbus about 820.

For example, some of the problems that happened last year in the current supply chain are now slowly recovering, especially the shortage of engines that caused a slow pace of the entire aircraft assembly. Of course, the FAA's requirements for Boeing are not yet completely relaxed. For example, now in the 737 MAX section, they gave 38 in the first quarter, and the Boeing wants the FAA to be able to accommodate them to do more of the 737, which is hard to understand.

The status of the entire delivery of LiP was, of course, due to the influence of the Boeing 737 MAX last year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a duplicate or need to merge. For example, the user mentions "This engine of LiP YB" and the subsequent "down", which may need to be merged into a coherent sentence. At the same time, pay attention to the mapping of the timestamp to ensure that the position of each sentence is correct. Next, I will post a sentence in order for each timestamp to be sorted according to the context. For example, questions about the supply chain and the parts of the Boeing order may need to be split into several paragraphs, each paragraph discusses different topics such as supply chain issues, demand growth, the impact of the repair section, etc.

In addition, the user mentions some technical terms and terminology, such as "AS 9100", "NATAP certification", etc., must be accurately preserved to avoid any possible misunderstandings. At the same time, attention to the correct conversion of numbers and units, such as "200,000 square feet" to "19500 square meters", to ensure that the unit conversion is correct. In the process, also pay attention to the consistency of the sentence, such as the user mentions "that this entire demand is always on the rise", followed by "because the two-day news also saw that it is a lot of Boeing orders", need to connect these sentences naturally to form a smooth paragraph.

At the same time, maintaining the logical relationship between paragraphs makes it easy to read and understand the whole. The engine of LiP YB dropped. Of course, there were some problems in the supply chain last year, some shortages. The part of that year, slowly these supply chain problems, slowly in the middle, so this year, the delivery of the entire LiP should come to 1600G engine.

That's why I think it's a good thing to do this for a long time. The maintenance part is actually during the pandemic, because of the supply chain problem, because the aircraft makes rotors in the new aircraft part, it actually doesn't keep up with the needs of the entire market. So the maintenance part, like the old CFN565 engine, the old one should be slowly eliminated in 2019, but because there is no way to maintain a state of repair in the past few years.

In Malaysia, I would like to see the press release, which was officially held in mid April, with our customers and Malaysia's entire aviation industry and media friends to report that we are officially operating in Malaysia. The site currently has an existing factory, about 32,000 square feet of factory, we started to recruit employees in December last year, so now we have a lot of training, the factory has started to operate in the city, and the factory has started to operate in the market.

We hope this year, we hope to make a ticket for this year, hoping to be completed in 2027. This is the current situation of Malaysia's land use. The land area is actually 4.8 feet, the factory part is about 2000 3500 square meters, the office part is actually the office area, the office area part is about 800 square meters, the back of the factory part is about 2700 square meters.

The Q3 part of Q4 will be all focused on the customer's certification, and many of the customers have already placed about about about, about Q3 Q4 will be certified. Of course, it is now already in the collection of some quotations, Malaysia's quotations have been received, after receiving the quotation, etc. After the end of the policy, the contents of the quotation will be slowly carried out. So the whole time I just mentioned here is like I just reported with you, Q2 culture and other seven kinds of essay Q3 to do a special process certification, and then Q3 Q4 to do a thing for the whole customer.

It is already in place. There will be new equipment. Some of the revenue will be allocated by us to the west. The next part of the report as reported before is also the first quarter of the first quarter of this year is 9.3.6 billion this is the whole part of the revenue is related to the whole revenue is gradually you can see that this trend gradually going up that the profit of the part of the profit and the profit of the part of the EPS Q1 is 1.1.1 billion EPS has 1.99 fast money EPS that is a content of the last quarter of the year is probably that you are in the state of such an EPS Q3 lower part of the Q3 because it is also the problem that some revenue can be reduced so we put this part of the total assets to Q1 there is about 159%159% of the current share of the total liability to Q1 is 59% of the common equity of the current share of the total debt is 28.58. The first part of the tariff question I have just reported with you that there is no impact on the rate of such exchange rates because there are some parts of the exchange rate. I think that the exchange rate is the same for both the Taiwan export industry and the Taiwan economy because of the rapid rise in exchange rates. Of course, I can not say that I am able to reduce the amount of US dollars to the extent I can operate, but I also see that the entire Ministry of Finance, regardless of whether China Malaysia or the whole raw material production of US dollars or the need for a certain amount of US dollars before collecting this question, I would like to say that some of the SPS members of the company will also have a lot of questions about this year. This year, if we have all the major customers to complete the quality system certification chemical process certification, including our staff is currently recruiting personnel training, etc. We hope that after this year, we will be able to start a relatively real progress in mass production, so the current stage is only in the market stage of our operation is very fast, including our internal, our consultation with the Malaysian government is also very positive, so you can see that we decided to buy the factory in October, we took all the license and now to start the trial process I think it is very fast. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***

I think this is probably going to affect around 2.3% of revenue. I'm sure there are. That part has time, because it's now May, and it's half a year, because we're still working on it. I think we're still confident in that part, but I'm just saying that our internal capacity needs to be supplemented.

As you may have guessed, it's very busy right now, either in Taiwan or in China, so we'll be actively investing in a new production capacity. Of course, there will be more capital expenditures in Malaysia, including the new factory we just mentioned, which needs to be covered by capital expenditures. The principle of the factory is that we still add some equipment, and this equipment is reported to you that because my Taiwan and China's capacity is now, so it is not possible to have this content transferred. So most of the new equipment, so there will be new capital expenditures in this part.

Investment friends say that he will recycle the U.S. original processing, this thing we have been doing in the past, before the U.S. tariff trade war, in fact, we have been doing it, so the overall impact is not very big. Also, I would add that because our main material comes from the U.S., under the influence of tariffs, it will actually be offset.

In addition, he mentioned that the whole production capacity will not be like other industries can not share the situation, and now we have no such requirements, mainly or customer product certification. This part of the four engine company revenue ratio, it is difficult to say the whole proportion, but I give you an overview image. I fastener part is about 90% of the engine stuff, the fastener tower in addition to the engine we are slowly developing some of the fasteners, so the engine part is about 90% to 75% of the machine products, of course, because of the certification relationship, so the machine products are actually in Roth's-Wallace and P&P certification basically no.

Of course, G1 has been doing it for a long time. We've been doing it for 5, 6, and 5 years. It's the part of its fascination that's just beginning last year, so it's probably the part that's still growing. There's another question I'm going to have to clarify here: I think some of my investment friends have seen the first two weeks of Han Xiang's forging, and there's a news story about what's going on with the wind, and we've called the reporter who sent the report, and we've asked him to correct, because there's no investment in Han Xiang's forging.

It is important to know that the constant temperature forging is a very distant technology, and there is no technology for constant temperature forging in this area, so here we have to make a commitment with you. Since the question is probably repeated, and then we pick the one that has not been repeated, and then we will supplement the description. The question is that our material has been over-packed in a manufacturer's situation, so don't tell you that most of the manufacturers are in the United States. The global, we can do it, we can do it, there are basically no manufacturers of materials for our aerospace diet, and even Europe can do it, the source is also this one. So basically his market is a little oligo, so there is no way to concentrate because only a few can do it.

If you are looking for a fastener, you may be able to find the right one for you. If you are looking for a fastener, you may be able to find the right one for you. If you are looking for a fastener, you may be able to find the right one for you. If you are looking for a fastener, you may be looking for a fastener, but if you are looking for a fastener, you are looking for a fastener.

Here is a re-routing paragraph type transcript:. I think this part. [2784. 16-26785. 44]. He is not a single development strategy from small to large. [2785. 44-2789. 28]. We have just mentioned that no matter whether NACMOD racks, on the basis of forging, we have always been like this from small fasteners, small racks to large, so it has always been this way.

[2789. 28-2801. 58]. That said, this proportion or what I want to do, I am more difficult to say, because of this strategy increased how much revenue or increased competitiveness, this I think is difficult to use data to express. [2805. 42-2817. 24]. But as I just reported earlier, using forging this foundation, in fact, we are not only small to large, we have made the entire product line a wider, this is a strategy of the company. [2822. 36-2830. 04].

[2842. 84-2863. 06]. It may take more than a year, if the material is hand-in-hand. [2863. 06-2867. 98]. So why our company will particularly emphasize on the number of new product development, because it will not give me revenue this year, it must be a product line after the next three years. [2880. 52-888. 98].

[2890. 50-2897. 98]. The product is manufactured according to the customer's needs, of course, at present, because we do not have the ability to design the product, our company qualification, the company's qualification now we apply the company's qualification is actually not able to design the product. [2903. 86-2915. 64] Because there is a separate certification, there is a different certification system, so the current product we can only work on, this is said. [2922. 56-2927. 42]

[2937. 88-2948. 12]. That is basically the company has long been an inventory evaluation concept, then the current situation of the raw material market is still at a relatively high point in the past. [2954. 44-2961. 70].

In addition, there are a lot of questions about the US tariff policy on Southeast Asian markets and Southeast Asian countries, which will not affect the exchange rate. [2978. 40-2983. 06] I'm pretty sure I'm going to explain the part of tariffs, just to say that the current mainly or the customer is burdened, then I'll go further to say that the current guests will have two ways to do it. [2985. 36-30032. 32] The first is that they will go to the U.S. government to apply for exemptions, if they step on the syllabus or the equivalent tariffs, etc. [3012. 36-3017. 82].

The general manager said in a briefing that the world's two major aerospace manufacturers, one in Europe. [3021. 08-3031. 52] The European Union is also talking to the United States, whether the whole aerospace industry is exempted, then the current impact on the aerospace industry, then we can not see much. [3039. 22-3045. 06] That's the future, because the Boeing is a manufacturer of the United States, but also creating their GDP, the whole supply chain is complex, and the United States should not use this to smash their own money. [3056. 42-3063. 68]

So I think part of this part of the effect of tariffs should be limited, which is a condition of the first application exemption. [3068. 66-3071. 70]. The second is that the customer will still go to his clients to reflect the cost, so at the moment, I have not heard that the customer wants to pay his tariff costs. [3077. 82-3084. 46] This is the part of the tariff, and there is another thing about the exchange rate, which I know that in the last month, there is probably no listing company in Taiwan that I don't think can avoid all. [3094. 42-3099. 76]

So if you can guess that it's really bad, the last part of the product is about two months to avoid, then our shipment is probably about 99% of our revenue. [3108. 06-3117. 34] Our imports also have our main material is also paid in dollars, which is mainly from the United States or Europe, and most of them are paid in dollars. [3119. 74-3124. 98] This will be more relevant to the cost, as there will be a point of delivery, and there is a preparation with the spare material. [3112. 78-3140. 06]

So there will be links, but there will be no equal sign, which is a million this month, which is 10% of my cost, which is 10% and then equal to my material cost, probably not this concept. [3141. 74-3149. 70] If you have a long-term look at the increase in our inventory, that is much higher than our material cost. [3153. 74-3159. 66] So there is no way to compare the ratio to that, then there is another problem here I say, in the EOSBASE industry, I am TN1, I want to be TN1 and I can be TN2 as well from the point of my receipt. [3167. 06-3183. 06]

Because if I use G1, my engine manufacturer is TN1, but by the engine manufacturer's TN1 to give me an order, then I'm TN2. [3192.0 06-3199. 06]. So I'm saying that I can be TN1 and I can be TN2, and that part of the body at present Fonda does not have a direct deal with the Boeing or Airbus. [3204.0 06-3213. 06] Because the parts of the fasteners are in the Boeing and Airbus, they don't handle themselves, so the Boeing and Airbus are giving them their own presents in the handle. [3216. 06-3224. 06]

These dispute came to me, so if I could call it TN2 by Boeing, that would be the case. [3228. 06-3236. 06] There is no advantage between us and our competitors, and I think FONDA can say that in all respects, including that the whole service and the entire company's entire capital expenditure is a positive aspect, I think we are a little more positive than these companies in Europe and America. [3239. 06-3259. 06]

I don't know about that, just like they say about our other esports counterparts.

In the past, like the British or who, they may have some, because with Airbus, there may be some suggested investment, this will also be. But I want to compare the flexibility of the company's operation, the whole of the flexibility of this different manufacturing capabilities, I think we are better than a part of them. In fact, if the SPS collection list is in the season of composition, should have, from now until the end of the year, according to the amount of material, according to the amount of carbon in the production, in the next two and three seasons, there will be, there will be no ideas to explore in terms of motorcycles, of course, we have been actively with the Boeing and Airbus, in the active contact, so I just reported, because they did not buy the fasteners, they were commissioned to others, so we have a lot of demand, but this year, but this company's a strategy, we have to talk about a lot of information about the fact, if we all the future, we know, if we will be with the company, if we will be the future, if we will not only a new, if we will be the company, and if we will not only a new information about the company, if we will only a half, if we will be able to follow the company, if we will do a new, if we will only a half, if we will be the company, if we will be the report to the next year, we will be the next year, and if we will be the company, if we will not only a new, if we will be the year, and if we will be the company, if we will be the company, if we will only a new information, if we will be the next year, if we will only a new information, we will be the year, if we will be the year, if we will only a new, if we will be the company, if we will only a new, if we will be able to provide a new information, if we will be the next year, if we will not, if we will only a new information, we will be the next year, if we will be the company, if we will only to report, if we will only to report, we will only to the company, we will not, we will not, we will, we will not, if we will only a half, we will only a new, This question is about the size of Taiwan China and Malaysia's revenue, because Malaysia is not able to pick up its own, because the relevant position is not over, so the current order mode or Taiwan's Nafu and Kunshan two places to pick up a base, which is based on the current revenue situation, the Taiwan part is about 570, that is, in terms of receiving orders, Taiwan's part is about about 70%, Kunshan's part is about 20%, so how in the future, I would like to say that according to the customer certification situation, according to the future certification of the customer how to order, because there will be progress to get these changes in this manufacturing place, so it will be cool time.

In the future, we will combine the software part, and the use of the human robot above, to do a change of the whole layout, some work, may have used the past part, slowly gradually gradually to use the human robot to replace, of course, this part is not fast, this is not so fast, so we need, we already have a team, including our AMIS, including our automation unit, we are a special group, we specialize in the development of this, including the AI and human robot above the application. Now most of the questions, we have done the answer, new product development to the customer, the product received a long time, this aviation exploration is such, we need to receive the customer RFQ, then may take a month to quote, after the client may take a lot of the three months after the quotation, it may take three months to complete, and then it may take three months.

It may take a month or two, but if he loads heavy, it may take half a year or longer. So at this time, the product of the voyager is like this, and he will pull a long time, possibly from RFQ to mass production, and may take two years. So why the customer is doing the migration of the shipper, he will push, at least a year and a half earlier, to do the migration of the shipper, to do a tour of the shipper.

The first is the company itself, we actually have our RFQ department followed Marketing, we have been looking for a new product line for the next five to ten years. You can see the company Protagonism, you can see that we will have a new product coming out every four to five years, for example, after NAT out, there will be a large forging after the GIGABYTE, and then there will be a large forging after the GIGABYTE will be Bolt, and then there will be a new product line in the future. In fact, this is our RFQ department, followed by our marketing, we collect market information, and the whole content of the so-called Niche Product, we will find out some content we want to develop. Of course, this part is based on our own judgment, the content of the competition, we have to make a new product development.

What is the current lack of parts? I think that part of the client now, because in fact, in the past two years, Lip has slowed down the speed of the entire aircraft manufacturing of Airbus and Boeing, so there is no shortage of parts in the market. Of course, the client now receives, we are talking with a few customers, and the client also wants to continue to develop a new manufacturer, but this part is still talking about.

In the past, we can see that we have been in stock for about two years, and our new material inventory continues to increase, which comes from a background, in the previous year or the previous year, our material from the order to get about 80 to 90 weeks, about two years of a level. So under this premise, when we buy more than the supplier's capacity is long, so we actually early in the epidemic, that is, there is a more than 70 to 80 weeks of the material supply, which we can supply.

That I think we all responded to the question, then if there is anything else, we will be able to talk again, I know you like it, and we will talk about it again. Well, today's bill will be over. Thank you for joining the group with investors.
