Thank you for joining the forum hosted by First Gold Securities. Today, we are the forum for Pharmaceutical Light Technology Co., Ltd.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the chief executive of the company today. The first is Vice President Wen-Sheng. The second is Mr. Wen-Sheng. The second is Mr. Wen-Sheng. The third is Mr. Chu-Hsien Liu. Next, we will ask the Deputy General Manager Wen-Sheng to introduce us about the company's operations.

Now I have given my Master Award to Vice President Wen. Thank you, Vice President. Thank you for the first gold. There are also Mei Ting. Maybe I still have a few new legal persons. I will introduce the status of the company.

There will be some more anime for you later. In fact, the drug lamp was actually established in 1981. It is headquartered in Taoyuan city of Badd. The early start was to be an antenna. At present, the whole development of the business is probably finished with an antenna.

Then there is the current direction to the community module. There are related measurement equipment for the agent. There are some testing and certification services. In recent years, there have also been a number of requirements for some of the customers. We are broadcasting in Badd. We currently have a Taoyuan location in Taiwan.

Taipei is the Taipei location. Taoyuan is mainly responsible for product research and development and design and the headquarters. That is the word for Taipei is one of our offices to develop an arts and crafts career. If we have an office in Taipei, we have an office in the bay area. There is one of our subsidiaries there.

We have a deep blue base in mainland China. It is mainly in Kunshan. There are also a number of R&D teams that are responsible for the domestic sales. We also have a factory in North Vietnam in response to the needs of our customers. It is mainly responsible for the production and manufacture of antennas.

The company was founded mainly at that time. It was very responsive to the needs of its customers in the future. Then there may be some political problems that may be facing in the future. Maybe this place will also start to do some things like setting up a production site.

Our main product is the public antenna. Our biggest customer is the Vibra customer. It is the consumer type product that we have in the early days to do mobile phone. But because at that time it was a Sino-US trade problem. Later, slowly the mobile phone antenna did not do it. Then we turned to the NV antenna.

That's what we've been working on for a few years. Then we've developed the whole antenna. There were also three zones and four zones in the public antennas. It's probably the same antenna. So we think the whole setup is going to go to the high screen.

That's because some of the factors that go to the high screen are physical limitations. So it must be developed to be a different kind of blur. That's because the whole antenna is just right in the last few years. That's because the development of the antenna is very important.

The market for a new application is like this. Fortunately, this antenna is a technology and product. It can be applied to a market of the North Satellite. Therefore, the company also invested in the development of the ground receiving station such as this.

It is a product that measures electromagnetic waves. Basically, there are products that are closer to the human body. For example, there are tablets and human arms. Because the human body is closer to the human body when it is used.

This company is an electromagnetic wave measurement device. We are currently the exclusive agent of China and Taiwan. At present, this device has a market share of about 90% or more in the world. Most of the larger applications are mobile phone manufacturers and third-party certifications.

We started this equipment about ten or twenty years ago. We had some testing and verification businesses. Their nature was similar to the update and the SGS. Then we actually started about three years ago. I think this industry is more of a large capital investment industry. So we were about three years ago.

There is a company in the mainland of China that has been sold to us. It has been sold to foreign companies in Canada and Europe, and then we have turned our test business to the front-end of the test.

These tests are in the process of customer development. Then he must comply with some of the association agreements. Or a performance standard of some of the related products. So this section will be more consistent with one of the characteristics of one of our company's operations.

Helped him complete some relevant tests. It was just mentioned that we had some sustainable services for our customers. That would basically be because we actually received this service eight years ago. We had a project that was a government project. At that time, it was to help the country develop the energy certificate system.

That's the third four years of going. That's because it was about three years ago. At that time, the carbon neutral issue was really big. So some customers said. So you can't help with some coaching. So we started this business.

Then we will be judged according to their products. There will be other fields for which they are applied. There will be products that we have already developed. That we will do something like this according to FR1 products. I just mentioned that there are empty products.

With NB products. That's the evaluation of FR1. If we go to the evaluation of FR2, that's probably what we have. An antenna module with a millimeter wave. That's the part of us.

That is. We also have a factory in North Vietnam in response to the needs of our customers. It is currently responsible for the production and manufacture of antennas. We have a subsidiary in Poland last year in Europe.

Then there may be some problems with art politics. Maybe this place will also start to do some things like setting up a production site. That's what I just introduced. That's it. That's it.

That's it.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided verbatim fragments and note that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine these verbatim entries into a coherent paragraph, while keeping the order and content unchanged.

For example, in the case of MSI product development, it may be necessary to combine multiple related sentences into one paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps, if the time is continuous, it may belong to the same topic, and if the time is not continuous, it may need to be segmented. During the process, I need to make sure that no sentences are missing, including those that may seem uncoordinated or duplicated.

In addition, attention to the oral expression, such as "wait for us that marketing director" and "so let me take the initiative", these need to keep the original words without any modification. It is also necessary to deal with the correct format of digital and proprietary terms, such as "ORU inside Orem" and "Quartzer in the United States", to ensure that these names are correct. At the same time, attention to whether the format of the timestamp is uniform, the user's example timestamp format is [minutes - minute. seconds], need to be consistent. In the process of financial data, such as "the revenue is about 1.7 billion" and "Maori about 41 members" need to ensure the correctness of the numbers and units, although "body" may be a "percent" can not be written, but according to the rules can not modify the original text, so retain the original.

Finally, check whether the entire paragraph is smooth and make sure that there is no missing sentences. It may be necessary to read multiple times to make sure that each sentence is placed correctly and the transition between paragraphs is natural. If there are uncertain places, such as when a timestamp jump is needed, depending on how the user handles it in the example, it may be necessary to segment at the time jump to keep the structure clear.

</span> We have developed 28G and 39G. That's 37G. The 7 to 24G is probably what we have developed in Orem, and the only thing we mentioned is that the ground junction station of the orem is the User Terminal. That's because the company actually has some product development on the side of MSI, so in fact, we are still going to work with some of the device manufacturers of MSI, such as Quartzer in the United States, NM, and then go with him for an experiment.

This is the part we are going to do in addition to the development of the product, we will continue to put some of the related satellite products on the moon, in the running, in the space time of the relevant equipment, we will do some is to do some construction and agency such. That is, we are about to participate in the exhibition every year, we are about to participate in the main three parts of the exhibition, we are about to participate in the exhibition, the NWC is the main thing we are going to go to, the NWC is more like the marketing director, because he is just the exhibition he is going to attend, so let me take him to the show, then see the situation, and some of the market with us to such a situation.

In 2020, Q1 to Q4, our revenue was about 1.7 billion, and compared to last year, it was slightly recessioned with four limbs. Our gross profit for the whole year was about 41 members, then our cargo capacity was about 1.5 billion, then EPS about 3 pieces, then we can see now that we are actually 23 years and 24 years compared to some of the affected parts, and I will tell you a little bit more about that.

In the first quarter of the year, the sales revenue was already in circulation, and the first quarter was mainly due to the customer's interest, because the customer was basically a single season, and the second quarter will probably start to convert some old and new products. The first quarter of this year was especially because many customers in some new products of AIDC, he may be a little bit behind a first-level, so it is actually a bit less likely to cause the first quarter of the kind of pull. But there are some messages with the customer there that are likely to be due to tariff issues, and then how many customers will have a certain period of time after this 90 days, there will be some parts of the end of the earlier to pull the goods.

In the first quarter of this year, we have seen that the stock digestion in the customer's stock should be also a paragraph, so we think that the industrial application should continue to go up and then increase. This is the part of our current performance. This part of our current performance is mainly in the mainland China market, and this part of our actual turnover rate is not so much.

This is the most important part of the Otik test, which is that it has been slowly going through some of Europe's Oren products testing, because in fact, it has been a few years to include AI or some permanent issues, so it is more important to pay attention to, as well as new markets. The information security we do is basically not the entire field of the company, but rather the product level of information security, that is, you say that this product is actually going to sell to Europe or to other countries, you have some security standards to meet, and we probably do this security.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript:. We have about 900 million cash in Q4 last year. But since we have raised a CP in the first quarter, we currently have about 4.5 billion cash.

In addition, this asset is about 3.7 billion, it is not about 1.5 billion. Ordinary right is about 21 to 2.2 billion. Just mentioned is my cash, that is, my last year's cash is about 900 million. But in fact, in my first quarter, there are about 1.5 billion.
