Welcome to participate in the investment advanced Hello, I am the chairman of today's QIC conference, Alex Lee, CEO of Broadlight International QIC. Welcome to participate in the online investor briefing, hosted by KGI Securities in the first quarter of 2025.

The first meeting of the company representative is the CEO of Nanbao Digital Xu Shengmao. The financial management office, Mr. Guo Shengmao, is cooperating with everyone. In the first quarter of 2025, the financial figures and legal briefings are published on the company's website and the public information observation station.

In the first quarter of 2025, we were invited to explain the operating results of the first quarter of 2025. Thank you, all of you, online investment advanced friends, I am the assistant of Nanbao Digital Financial Management and spokesperson Lin Kunjing Next I report to you how many years of operating results of Nanbao's first quarter of operation results and future outlook. See the second page This is a brief summary first share of the results of the first quarter of operation results of Nanbao's future outlook and strategic layout. See the fourth page First share of revenue in the first quarter of 2025 This is the first quarter of the year, revenue is NT$5.54 billion, compared to the same period last year. In addition, we are also looking forward to continuing to grow this year with the continued expansion of new industry applications. In early April, US President Donald Trump announced a new peer-reviewed tariff measure, which represents 98% of revenue in the Taiwan Asia and Australia market, according to last year's revenue distribution. In the near future, we will continue to focus on the development of next gen growth strategy, and continue to develop new products and applications through active research and development, which will help us to further enhance the long-term competitiveness and reduce the impact of external risks.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the user cannot delete, rewrite or condensate any original sentence, so the integrity of the original sentence must be maintained. Next, I check the provided verbatim fragments every timestamp for each sentence.

During the processing process, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit in order to make reasonable segmentation. For example, content such as competitive advantage, product layout, market strategy, etc. may require segmentation discussion. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural without missing any information.

In addition, some sentences are separated by timestamps, e.g. [700. 66-701. 94. 94], followed by [701. 94-704. 26], which needs to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph. According to the context, these sentences should be linked together to form a complete paragraph. It is also important to pay attention to the consistency of the punctuation symbols and sentences. For example, some sentences may end with commas or commas or synonyms, and need to ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs. At the same time, check for duplicated or combined sentences, but cannot be modified or deleted according to user requirements.

For example, in the example provided by the user, each question and answer is individually segmented, but the order and content of the original sentence is maintained. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to confirm that there are no missing sentences, all the contents are arranged in the original order, and paragraphs are divided in a reasonable manner, in line with the user's reading habits. At the same time, check whether there is a misplacement of the format error or timestamp to ensure that the final output meets the user's requirements.

This year, semiconductor and optoelectronic adhesives continue to show strong growth momentum and are expected to maintain high growth performance. Although the end market of woodworking and textile adhesives is relatively high in the United States, we are continuing to closely monitor the relevant changes. However, in general, the proportion of adhesives in all kinds of applications is relatively dispersed, and the proportion of single applications is small.

We continue to expand new market opportunities to increase the proportion of high gross profit products, with innovative solutions actively involved in the fields of semiconductor, electronics, woodworking and textile glues, to develop more applications. Among them, we are particularly interested in the performance and application of electronic industries in the field of semiconductor adhesives and electronics, so we will increase the investment of resources and further strengthen the product technology and market layout. In terms of coatings and building materials business, by the first quarter of 2025, the revenue of electrical materials accounted for 16% of the total consolidated revenue, mainly from Australia, and continue to grow.

In addition, the strategic goal is to accelerate the layout of the building materials business by continuing mergers and acquisitions. For coatings, in the first quarter of 2025, revenue accounted for 9% of the total consolidated revenue, mainly in the supply chain and Asian local markets, and this year's continued growth goal is to continue to focus on improving profitability.

In addition, our investment advanced report, based on the results of the 11th corporate governance evaluation released by the SEHK on 30 April, is the first 5% of the year, which is an important milestone for us. At the same time, Nanbao also ranks the top 10% of non-financial electronic enterprises with a market value of more than 10 billion, showing our continuous efforts and achievements in corporate governance.

Thank you Hank. We will continue with the Q&A, and we will be open to ask questions online. You are welcome to click on the Q&A function at the bottom of the window and enter your question, and we will answer it as soon as possible.

First of all, we are going to answer the questions we are going to ask before the conference. The first question we are going to address is, what are the implications of U.S. tariffs on Nanbao and how do we respond to them? Thank you. I think Nanbao is close to our customers in all major national facilities, so we are not exporting directly to the U.S., so far we have not felt this effect. At present we have not felt this effect, we have not felt this effect, at present we have not felt this effect, we have not felt this effect, we have not experienced this effect, we have not

However, we hope that the company's operation is to focus on the performance of the industry and do not bear some uncertain risks from fluctuations in exchange rates. About two years ago, Nanbao had continued to adjust the assets and liabilities of the US dollar, making it more close to the risk of reducing the exchange rate in a way that uses such a natural safe haven.

The next investor asked if the gross and operating interest rate in the first quarter was quite good. What is the main reason? So how do we look at this year's gross and operating interest rate? Yes, Hank replied. So this year's first quarter's revenue performance was doubled, so we continue to focus on high gross profit products because of the economic and efficiency gains.

Therefore, there is a better performance on the gross profit margin. Therefore, the potential impact on the cost of raw materials and the equivalent tariffs is relatively uncertain at the moment. However, there should not be too much negative development. Because the end price of sneakers is about 5 to 8 times that of the shoe factory, perhaps the supply chain needs to absorb the part.

In recent years, we have been actively adjusting the layout of our products to introduce more innovative and high value-added solutions, so the results will continue to be shown in the future.

Okay, so we asked Morrison to answer. Thank you for your concern. We have continued to work with our customers to develop some of our current products, such as the growth of the UV festival, which is very quickly affecting the yield rate of some processes in this society, so terminal customers are very interested in such products. But there are some process certifications so it takes some time to prepare for such a production line that will not be too fast at the beginning, and the current revenue seems to be nearly twice as good as it should be this year.

The above is the investor question that we received before the meeting. Then I remind you to start answering questions online about the investor on-site and then remind you if you have any questions, then it is difficult for you to select the Q&A function at the bottom of the window and enter your questions we will answer in a timely manner. So the first question for online investors to ask is what is the annual revenue and accounting question?

I would like to know what is the annual revenue and accounting problem of Wunder.

In the second half of the year, there will be a lot of revenue. Then if the year to see the growth of the new products, the customer is a long, but just confirm, there are some cars, there are laptops, watts, some car cloths, this year should be several times of revenue, thank you. The next question is how much the first quarter cost of one-off effect, that the whole year should be how much, thank you.

The following investors ask how the sensitivity analysis of the exchange rate is likely to be how Taiwan dollar or even 1%, the impact of the gross profit margin is about how much, because the recent exchange rate fluctuation is more intense, we are concerned about this. I think the exchange rate is the effect of the sensitivity analysis of the increase in the value of my opinion, the impact of the gross profit margin is not very large, but the outside of the industry is a relatively large profit, the foreign currency evaluation of this piece, the impact is realistic. Why, because the gross profit margin is part of the industry's revenue cost, he is a weighted average, but the foreign currency price is the concept of the end exchange rate, so I think that if the value of the 1% of the sensitivity analysis of the foreign exchange rate is how much the impact of our foreign exchange rate is, I just said that we have had a lot of a natural hedge, because I do not want the exchange fluctuation in the Southbound to us.

The next investor asked if the second quarter of the revenue usually grows better than the first quarter. Is it possible that the gross profit margin will grow better than the first quarter? Is it true that the gross profit margin will grow relatively well, because we have a big 100 million interest rate, relative to a few. This gross profit margin, that is, the gross profit margin, I asked again, should have the opportunity to go up again, it looks like, to keep a little bit, the profit may rise some, concerned about the net profit margin.

Thanks. In a few directions, the semiconductor manufacturing is related to this display, and the entrance to the threshold is actually very high, but we have some experience in other applications, but we still spend a lot of time to understand the needs of the market, some of his special requirements, but research and development is the strongest and we are still one of the best in the direction we are willing to invest in this market research, the final product hope is to improve this performance, such as in some heat-resistant processes can be resistant to higher temperatures, that in the UV deboning part can be very sticky, not sticky, so this can be done in the same direction as SmartTab, these technology products are good in Taiwan, and some industries.

***This is also possible with this ***. ***This ***. ***This ***. ***This ***. ***This ***.

**This. **This.** can be adjusted by using these R&D methods. **This.** Product**

**Replace the overseas **. **The manufacturer is not very good at communication **Direction**. **In addition, the initial effect of optical glue used in the display has been good**. **There is also a stable supply**.

**For a few customers**. **This is the semiconductor-related comparison. **Initial**. **This is not a direct supply to the technology manufacturers**. **We are working with the manufacturer**.

**Developing better applications to replace**. **Some of the existing products**. **So we're still targeting a few comparisons**. **High-end customers to develop**. **The current performance is also good**. **Promote this.

**Product line. **Note above**. **Thank you Morrison**. **The next investor ask is to ask for the distribution of capacity in each region**. **What is the distribution ratio**. **This is your answer.**

**All capacity. **This part is because we are close to local customers. **We are the distribution of revenue and regional capacity**. **We will be about**. **That looks like a low-level Taiwan.**

**About 18%-19%**. **From Vietnam, about 28%**. **From mainland China, about 27% of Australia, about 14.3%**. **Indonesia, about 10%**. **From Indonesia, the rest is about 2.5%**. **Thank you for the explanation above.

**Thank you Hank**. **The next investor asked if I wanted to ask you about the current**. **Net financial assets**. **About how much**. **That would like to know about 2Q25**. **What is the estimate of the loss amount?

I'd like to answer the question that I want to answer in advance. **Currently**. **I'd like to know how many parts of the time deposit are about**. **I'd like to explain the current Nanbao**. **Time deposit is**. **Deposit is stored in**.

**It is also a problem that the company's foreign currency is not rated in US dollars. **It should be $450 million**. **Currently, there is a time deposit**. **The annual interest rate is about**.

**This is currently more than 4%. **So this is a question he didn't ask for a bribe. **Because his public credit currency is not in US dollars. **This is **This is not a concern. **This is an estimate of the amount of bribes in the second quarter of that year**.

**This is a little bit. **This is a little bit.** It's a little bit difficult now because it's mid-May now. **Then until the end of June**. **I think it's going to be a bit of a change.**That's what we want to do.**

**Bribery control is in our power. **This is not going to affect one area of the business. **I believe**. **I just explained it. **We have already said it.**

**Cut down that one. **The US dollar market**. **The exposure of the section shows that I think the impact on Nanbao should not be too big. **Thank you** **Thank you for answering**. **The next investor asks if there is a chance for the second half of the year's revenue**.

**This is more difficult to answer because I think**. **Trump's tariffs have an impact on the end demand or how much**. **If**. **The impact on the end demand reduction will be slightly affected**. **We will definitely try to do more than**.

**Existing products or new product development or investment is ongoing. **I can't grow and I can't use the existing stuff to cover**. **External efforts to achieve the goal of growth. **Thank you for answering**. **The next investor question is**.

**What is the price of our products? **Is there any pressure to adjust the price****Product pricing**** **Every customer may have the same brand will dominate the customer**** **Generally this adjustment**

**The ratio is not very high**. **It is generally a quarter of a year**. **Adjustable but not necessarily a quarter of a year**. **Evaluation of large-scale evaluation of revenue will not be adjusted**. **After evaluation, **There will be a chance to talk**.

**Please note that there is also a time difference between the adjustments. **Please note that this will take effect after the first half of the season. **Please note that the effects are relatively flat**.

**Cakes are a lot more. **No** Tariffs will be issued.**Please check this **Last**

**Thank you. **Thank you. **The next investor question is**. **Japan is using plastic technology in semiconductors**. **Why they don't want to do**. **The cost consideration is the future of this technology.**

**This should be a little misleading. **Mainstream or Japanese manufacturer**. **Semiconductor**. **Semiconductor**

***This is a new process or a new one. ***Some *** Some ***.*** So He**.

We mainly listen to the pain points of our customers. **We**. **The future**Thank you for Morrison**. **The next investor asked was last year's billion-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-year semiconductors**.

**All plastic business revenues are higher than last year's. **The gross profit margin is higher than the average of the company**. **This part of **We**. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
