Thank you Gi-Rong. Ladies and gentlemen. We are now starting to answer. Please anyone today. Please press '1' on your phone keyboard.

Then you will enter the question, when you are published, ask your question, if you find your question, has been answered your response. Press '2'.

Now press '1' on your keyboard. If you want to ask a question, thank you. Now the first question will be.

Sonyling UBS for an interview. Please visit. Thank you for your question. My first question. I would like to start with the impact of the loan.

How does a loan affect? Q2 and 2 customers. Benefits. As well. The impact of a business plan. What do you think of Q2 interests.

How. But a loan against the price. It affects how you feel. music I also have a loan with collate. Our customers, as well as technology products.

Aufp Jacob Ori baja assisted. Me. I. scored. We will be in the 2027s. There will be the most technology.

Industrial design in the United States. As the foundation of the industry. NUMC also has a healthy financial building. It can be operated. Operation in operation. Despite increasing financial tension.

And global loan policy. Also increased operations. In the central production industry affirmation. And global loan policy. Also increased operations. We were in the 2025s.

No need to see the market, change, of course, in the second half of the witness, will become very limited, while long-term customers may be theirs.

Internal industry selection. And external industry selection. And explore external industry selection. And external industry selection. Strategic design of NUMC. Focus.

Technology is different. Global industry is different. Industry is different. Industrial design. So, in a short time.

We see, change, what we see, in the second half, but if you put the result of Q1.

And the second half of the guidance, we think we are in the early years of expectations, a little earlier, this will give us some.

In the second half. Confirmed growth. Well, thank you, Jidong. Basically, you say. Q2 growth. Not able to be.

A little forward, so, on this matter, we should be concerned.. not less.. the meaning of the second half is increased.. because it is less likely to be promoted?

less likely to be promoted.

You're right, in the second half of the movie 1.46 some customers want to do something early, but some customers do the same thing, so the second half has very little impact. However, we can now see the second half results. What we see now does not mean the second half results will be in the next two years.

We start with the value and strategy of shipping currency, and we don't completely compare the value of currency. Our strategy is to let the currency and the customer leave the currency of the low-entry zone, under the difference between technical differences and the economic differences of the factory. In addition to the pressure, the transport currency still takes care of providing the technology of differences and the cooperation of the currency and the customer.

So, in the Q1 and Q2 transportation differences, do you think that the entire 28nm and 22nm sales will not enter the second half of 2025? First of all, our guidance in the second half, we will reach 70% in the whole company. Of course, 12nm, 12 inches higher than the average, 8 inches lower than the 12% point. I would say 22-28 is not the best part.

So Meet Team proposed overall revenue growth, right? Thank you. Last question, can you give us the latest update on Intel at 12nm? We may be in the US in 2026, can you see that this cooperation has a stronger requirement?

Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you. Next, Laura Chang, City, please. Thank you, thank you for asking me questions. I want to know your cooperation, apart from Intel, do you have any opportunity to work with other IDMs in the United States?

We have an IDM client that works with Intel in the United States. Of course, the most important project for us right now is the 12 million-meter U.S. footwork in cooperation with U.S. partners. I understand that since I had a message before, I understand that the U.S. administration has been rejected, but I just want to ask, apart from our current U.S. IDM client, do we have the opportunity to work with global companies?

But I think from the perspective of our international company, we are looking for ways to enhance the value of the company, and if we are able to enhance the value of the company, we will look for it. There are currently no cooperative activities in progress, so we have to say that there is no cooperative activity now. We can also look for the value and return of the company, which is our order and we will continue to look for various options.

** Paragraph type transcript**. **Question meeting**. Question meeting is in progress, one of the participants asked a question: [1538. 54-1541. 54] Is it 12%?

Next, an expert answered this question:. [1541. 54-1544. 54] The price of Q1 has not been reported. The expert further asked this question:. [1544. 54-1547. 54] We are on the price of the future. [1547. 54-1550. 54] What do you think?

[1565. 54-1568. 54] The second half of the price. [1568. 54-1571. 54] We can only give half of the rule. Another expert also joined the discussion: [1571. 54-1574. 54] But most of us are possible. [1574. 54-1577. 54] is based on the currency price. [1577. 54-1580. 54] and the action of the currency.

[1580. 54-1583. 54] and COGS. [1583. 54-1586. 54] We have done several actions. [1586. 54-1589. 54] to improve our likelihood. **Industry analysis**. This expert further analyzed the industry situation: [1589. 54-1592. 54] including business cooperation, technical differences.

[1628. 54-1631. 54] For example, small quality. [1631. 54-1634. 54] and 22 or 28 times currency. [1634. 54-1637. 54] and improve the efficiency of the product.

[1659. 54-1662. 54] and the obvious guidance of the second quarter. ** Industry changes**. Brent Ling further analyzed the situation of the industry: [1662. 54-1664. 54] I have two questions. [1664. 54-1667. 54] The first question is for the customer's category. [1667. 54-1669. 54] Whether there is a possibility.

[1744. 54-1747. 54] It is currently difficult to measure. [1752. 54-1754. 54] But in Singapore. [1754. 54-1757. 54] May be the best example. ** Predictions for the industry**. Brent Ling added: [1755. 54-1760. 54] P3 will be 2026.

We don't have enough sense to pursue better sales prices, so we continue to do a variety of ways to reduce sales prices, including a variety of software to manage sales prices and develop automated conversions. These ways can help us develop sales prices on both sides, including sales prices and development automation conversions. We need to do a variety of ways by reducing sales prices, and at first we mentioned that our sales prices for the year were higher than we mentioned earlier this year, but that's just what we wanted to do to further enhance the second half of our confirmation, so the pursuit of a better sales price is our final requirement for managing sales, and we hope we can do better.

The answer is yes, I think most customers are willing to complete the sales price of 120,000 as soon as possible, and they also have very intense product release time, they want our 120,000 sales price to be able to complete, so, yes, the pressure is there, we understand that we received our so-called early applications, so we made progress on the whole under pressure, but this has been very intense progress timeline, this is also our first cooperation with our partners, this is a lot of things we have to do to solve, we are not able to progress on the timeline. So, it is also a pressure and hope, but in fact, we have made progress on the plan, so thank you have answered, hope that you can make progress on the plan, do you see progress on the progress you want to progress, because because I know that you need to plan forward, if you want to make progress on the price of 120,000 sales price, I ask the question that if it will give you more space or if you or if you wish your engineers will be able to make progress on the future progress on the EUV, if you will be, if you will be, if you will only a very much more, if you will be able to do a very much more, if we will only a very much, that we will only a very much, we will only a very much.

Finally, I think this is a very short question, so I ask you, do you keep your money? Do you still keep half the money? Do you keep half the money? Our insights have never changed in 2025, and our insights in the industrial environment market in 2025 are starting to be in high sales, as we mentioned in the previous section.

Paragraph by _file_. ** Paragraph one**. "So that's the whole year of Alors - so you'll use the Uicing point as evidence for the current year - in the second half of the distribution is a positive form.

KCNC also has this view that if the value is on the half-track, this is my first question. I can ask our opponents, I mentioned that KC would be very clear about the customer, for this value, this is my problem. So how to deal with this value may be with the customer, this is our main direction. Well, I can, if you are not sure of the possibility of this value, but also to some extent assume the value, yes?

Well, the second question, I understand that the second half of the testimony is still unclear. I think that apart from the main design, you can not share, if possible the next decline, how do you see the customer's design from a different degree and your point of view. In terms of design, the current design is still similar to the first half of 2025, and the DLI at the application level as well as the design remains healthy in the commercial electronics industry.

Hello, I understand that now in other environments besides all the auto-mobility applications are in healthy labeling, but because of the 90-day stop, you will see how the customer supply will be upgraded in the second half and you will feel that this is going to be the way and the customer supply. First of all, we mention that the second half of the customer supply is not very much affected, so we should pass this to the general general supply. But the second half of the customer supply is very limited, so any data that is used to guess may change at night, so it is difficult to pass this to the customer.

We also have Wafer to Wafer to Wafer, including the RF front module, which also includes sensing, memory, and logic. We have supply requirements, from the point of view of supply, we see 2.D supply, we see HPC similar deep supply, and these requirements will continue to grow, so we expect this to be a new supply and we will be ready to supply these new ones.

This is still a very early step, so we don't expect to have a huge financial contribution in 2025, which will make a big contribution. I understand. My second problem is from the perspective of supply, I want to mention that supply in China also has a strong growth, supply has progress, in the middle of February last year you also mentioned supply strong growth, we can guess what the architectural progress in China's PATI, or we see that China has low-end competition.

The following are re-arranged into paragraph verbatim transcripts:. Because of this recovery or progress, if the future supply will be bigger growth, so our price or financial contribution will grow a lot. So, I mean, our price or financial contribution will grow a lot. If you can give us more views, I will be happy, thank you.

However, we see that in the first and second quarters we start a little bit of the field of the future. Therefore, in the second quarter and trade is very unclear, so we don't know when there will be any changes, so we can't enter into the we continue to focus on different technologies in order to work with new competitors in the future.

In addition, 2228Ultra Low Capability 2228Ultra Low Capability 2228Ultra Low Capability Technology, such as power tax on 28Nm platform, IoT power supply, WareBot and HAI applications, so this kind of plus our various manufacturing facilities, we believe that we have the ability to find the possible currency in a unique location, where we have any ideas, hope, which can help answer your questions. Thank you, we can stop this meeting now, thank you all today and thank you for your questions. If you have any questions, please contact UMC IR and we will be glad to help you.
