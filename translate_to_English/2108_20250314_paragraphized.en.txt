<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim text provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

I need to make sure that the sentences corresponding to each timestamp are placed correctly, and the transition between paragraphs is natural. At the same time, pay attention to verbalized expressions such as repeating or stuttering, which need to be preserved during finishing, but may be separated by appropriate punctuation marks (such as commas, periods) to make the paragraphs easier to read. In addition, the phrases referred to by the user may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence, so I need to combine these sentences in logical order, while maintaining the order and content of the original sentences. For example, part of the introduction team may need to combine multiple timestamp sentences into a consistent paragraph.

For example, a section about financial data may need to be segmented, but each data point should keep the original structure. Finally, I will read the entire collated paragraph verbatim to check if all the user's requirements are met, to ensure that there is no missing content, and that the format is correct. At the same time, make sure that all the timestamps and sentences correspond correctly without any wording or syntax errors. </think> Below is the collated paragraph verbatim (fully retains all the original content, adjusts the paragraph structure):

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team of today's representatives. We welcome you to join us as an assistant to the Accounting Department, the Sales Department Manager, and the Accounting Department. We will discuss the process today, and Mr. Hsia will exchange the results of the briefing. We will first pass the time to Mr. Lin. Thank you.

First of all, I would like to thank you all for your support. Thank you to the sponsor team for supporting the documents, and thank you to all the investors who came to us today. Thank you to our South African colleagues for coming to this legal meeting. It is not so cold today, but anyway, we have to break this scene.

I'll give you a brief report on what we did last year and the first quarter of this year. Last year, we probably saw a slight increase in our business, but the overall failure capacity did not increase. The main thing is the competition market, or the relative, competition in the entire main products of latex supply, there is a large amount of supply in the market. So although the main raw materials, our main raw materials are the size of the increase, but this part of the price of latex products to pass the price, in fact, it is impossible to fully pass on the whole.

This is probably the case. As you look back at the first quarter of this year, the whole business is still on the top of our first file, and here you will see the entire profit, and it is quite tight. Overall, the stock is probably a stock that lasts the whole year, so it goes to the first quarter of this year. As for when it will be more obvious, it will be like a joint of our business department to tell you a more detailed report.

We are now directly focused on the presentation. We are located in the southern part of the country in January of the sixty-sixth year, the number of people is currently two hundred and seventy people, and the research and development accounted for about 13.78. We have listed on this side of the country in August of the year to the eleventh year, and there is a cash value in the middle, which is now 49.21 yuan, which is our capital receipt. You can see that here is our quality, environment, natural hygiene has some of the specifications of ISO.

The second is that the world's largest glove market should be the United States.

This is the question of China's so-called U.S. trade tariffs, which may trigger the part of our glove, this section will have some fluctuations. That is, in our geopolitics, the impact of the agricultural economy on the U.S. economy and globalization, it may be more than a year-round display, especially in Taiwan, which will challenge one direction in the rubber business of our Southern Forest Plant, with a growth rate. That is to say, in addition to the employment of our original products, of course, we will continue to develop products in the company's philosophy of sustainable development, and with the efficient aspects to cut into, we should have some of these concepts, and we will develop them one by one by one by one another.

This is not the case, but it is possible that after a period of time there will be a second inventory problem, then there will be a second inventory problem, then there will be a second inventory problem, and it will be consumed, so it is not really able to reflect our order, and it may take some time. I just asked you to mention this second inventory problem, can you no longer share with us in detail? That is, in the second half of 2024, it should be the beginning of the second half of the year, the Trump administration of the United States, he paid that tariff, so in 2025, the Chinese gloves manufacturer, he will be facing more than 60% of tariffs, or even the most recent report is, 2026, so this part of this part will lead to the United States glove seller, he in the second half of the second half of the market, the second stock, and so we will know how much more about it is the next time, the next time, what is the next time, the most of the new stock, and the next, the next time, the most is the most is the most is the most is the next, and the most of the new stock.

In the first quarter, Ting Lexi has a slight downward, but he is not clear, in fact, he has just the whole past, and there is a whole future direction and trend, he has a general collation to report that he is about the whole spindle is here to take, so how to now, in fact, is not a very obvious state, that is, it is only the ability and war and go, the other part of the words, whether there are any other problems, such as that, or some of us have no other questions to ask, or our main raw materials, etc.

It is said that the whole material of Ding Lexi with our bisik gold, these two main raw materials account for our entire raw material costs about 6 to 7 percent, so it is very large for our gross profit, so if he said that we can not 100% of the price to push him to the price, then we will be very low, even if it is not a relatively different way to achieve that, the industry has a profit, the situation, so it is very big, good, he has an impact on the total cost of two to seven percent, can say that a lot of Ding Lexi to find death, good, good, Ding Lexi up ten, you can see whether we can adjust our prices to support him if there is not a full profit.
