Thank you very much. Investors are involved. Good afternoon for investors. Disagree. Just live streaming a little.

We apologize for waiting for you. Our presentation has ended. Now enter the QA section. It's just already been an investor. There are some problems in the dialog window.

Let's take a look at these questions first. The first question is, the cumulative profits of an ongoing business are near the zero-axis. Ask what the trading strategy is in the past. How to improve your investment efficiency.

What is your trading strategy in the past? The second question is, this year, for the US dollar of Taiwan dollars. Is the bond interest income. Is it possible to expand the bond. It is not easy to reduce the interest rate.

There's a better forecast than last year. That's the third question. This year's cash dividend yield is not weak. Will there be any next year?

That's the three questions. We asked General Manager Mao Zhenhua to explain to investors. Good for you, my friends.

I'm Mao Zhenhua, General Manager of Qinyi Futures. I'm currently working on it. I've been working on the three questions I've asked from my investment friends. I'm going to briefly answer some of them. The first is the political camp.

Our strategy is political camp. Mainly the strategy of subjective trading. That is, this year we are subjective. At the beginning of this year, because the broader market index is 24000 points.

We have been given the gift of life, the gift of life, the gift of grace, and the gift of God.

The two of us have seen each other, and we have seen each other, and we have seen each other, and we have seen each other, and we have seen each other.

We are the ones who have lost their lives, and the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, the ones who have lost their lives, and the ones who have lost their lives.

And then, after the big rally, we're in the political camp, and that's why we're doing so much more.

The second question is about the part of Kepling. Of course, in the content of this legal meeting, we see Kepling.

Set a record high. Up to 557 billion. So far. With this FED Watch's anticipation. There are still two numbers in the US this year. The anticipation of interest rates.

This year is better than expected, that is, there is no interest rate cuts, otherwise so far.

Plus this expected two-digit cut. We expect this to be the same as last year's. The interest income of the margin should be equivalent. That's the third question. That's the distribution rate that this year's cash encourages.

No, it was not before. We followed at the shareholders' meeting. Our shareholders explained it. It was because of this year's increase in cash. That year.

If there is no interference with cash increase, it should maintain a level of previous distribution rate. That is the case. True distribution rate. Or next year's resolution of shareholders' meeting. Or the resolution of next year's shareholders' meeting.

Then make this final confirmation. Thanks for the reply. That's all. Ask your friends for help. If you have any questions, you can continue to let us know in the conversation window. That doesn't seem to be the case right now.

There are more questions. Well. Thank you very much to all the investors who participated in our meeting today. I wish you all the best in investing. Thank you very much.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
