Finally, there is a perfect after-sales service part, whether it is our own construction or some construction cases, we are probably using this system to do a deal. Mainly or to serve our owners or customers. The financial information part, I am going to do a report and explain to you today is a financial figure of a business figure of 113 years.

The main increase in this figure is that last year the company had sold a piece of land, and the total amount of sales was about 1.57 million. So the part of this increase was due to the increase in the sale of that piece of land last year. That for the second item of a financial number of differences, the second item of gross profit, the 113-year gross profit is 1.55 million.

That is, the increase in revenue then the gross profit is also increased. The third part of the business profit is the 113-year financial figure is 1 billion . The difference between the 112-year figure is 1 billion . The difference between the 112-year figure is about 3.2%.

Another part of the financial information is for the company's operating income and earnings of the US stock in the past five years. For the other three years, please ask the investor and the other Mrs. to make a reference to this part of 112 and 113 years of this description.

At present, we have two parts of the project, one is the jade enterprise stock for some companies, it is mainly a plant construction and an office dormitory.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided transcription fragments in a manner that pay attention to the corresponding sentences per timestamp.

First, I will identify the subject of each paragraph. For example, the first part is about the construction projects undertaken by the company, including the amount and completion time. Next, the details of Pingtung International Baseball Field. Then, the sales situation of the construction business, including different cases such as the Phoenix era, the New City Hall, etc.

For example, on the part of Phoenix Villa, the user mentioned total sales amount, number of accounts, sales, etc., this information needs to be arranged in the original order, but it may need to be merged into the same paragraph to enhance readability. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in the order of time, but the user may want to group them by topic rather than strictly by timestamp. Therefore, I need to determine which sentences belong to the same topic and categorize them into the same paragraph.

In addition, the professional terms such as the "foreign receipt" and "finished percentage method" mentioned by the user need to be retained as is, cannot be modified. At the same time, pay attention to the correct representation of the numbers and amounts, such as "1.8 billion", "1.8 billion", etc., to ensure that there are no omissions or errors. During the processing process, it may be encountered duplicate or redundant information, such as the number of accounts on Phoenix Villa is mentioned many times, it is necessary to confirm that all sentences must be retained in the original order. For example, the user mentions "Phoenix Villa has 380 households" and "Phoenix Villa has 372 households", which may be a mistake or need to be retained as raw data must be kept.

Once I have completed the initial draft, I will read the entire content again to confirm that all requirements have been met, especially without deleting or modifying any of the original sentences, and that paragraphs have been divided into reasonable and easy to read. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but according to the example provided by the user, it should be kept as long as possible and only be formatted. </think> The following is a paragraph verbatim transcript (fully reserved for all the original sentences, only adjust the paragraph structure): --- There is a company here to do a construction, the contract amount is 1.8 billion, 1.3 billion, 0.9 billion, and this part is completed. The case is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year.
