Touch accounts for 75%, non-touch accounts for 25%. In detail, touch panels account for 46%. Touch screen chips account for 19%. Fingerprint accounts for 10%. Non-touch parts point to device GuanSig accounts for 19%. Microcontroller accounts for 4%.

The rest of the 2% comes from revenue from GuanSig companies. Take a look at our profit and loss statement. Compared to the last quarter of 2023 Q4.

Revenue fell by 2.4% year-on-year. A slight decrease. However, our gross profit margin was approximately 19.6%. Clearly better than the fourth quarter of 2023.

At the same time, we also reached the high standard given when the development last quarter was over. Overall, our cost was about 70,8,0005. Latecomers were higher than the 4th quarter of 2023. Mainly focused on product research and development. There was also light and other expenses. So in the 4th quarter last year, our net profit for our industry was 70,22,2 million.

The part of the industry is about 6 million. A net income. The main reason is that we have some so-called exchange income last year. Interest, dividends, etc. Of course, deduct the loss of parity interest. So the net profit is about 6 million.

So we reached 702 million before tax. After tax, the surplus is $6003 million. The surplus is 2 trillion per share. So this part of us is after tax. After tax, the surplus is $6003 million. The surplus is better than the 4th quarter of 2023.

We immediately look at the third quarter's comparison. Because I think the 4th quarter is the low season of consumption. So we saw a 10.8% decrease in revenue in the 4th quarter last year compared to the 3rd quarter. But in fact, last year's 4th quarter because the so-called sales problem in the United States is coming up with the new government.

There are two new orders. So I think this benefit should fall into the 4th quarter and this year's 1st quarter. So the gross profit margin part is about 49. 6. I think it is also better than the 49.3 of the previous quarter.

That is to say, an increase in over 20.8 fees. So the overall OPMARGIN is 23.8. That per share is 2.1. That's why the entire second half of last year's operation was $4.59. That morning we convened the Board of Directors.

I think it's up to us to maintain our original promise. That's 80% or more of our share. From a year-round perspective. Our revenue in 2024 reached 126.96 billion. It was 5.3% higher than in 2023.

The gross profit margin portion is an average of 48.9% throughout the year. It is obviously better than 45% in 2023. The main factor is the growth of high-profit products. Especially last year there were three product growth. Two of them were high-profit products.

Overall, our OPEX is about 31.38 billion. A little higher than the 29.98 billion in 2023. This is mainly a cost of $6.5 million for the first quarter of last year's recognized mutual long stock.

In addition, we have an increase in salary every year. That is, we have an increase in salary every year. These two factors are the main reason for the slight increase in OPEX. So last year's operating rate was 30.66 billion.

Looking forward to the positive benefits of our exchange income or 95 million. Others also have some cash dividends, etc. Interest income. Some AI auxiliary funds, etc. But of course, the loss of the evaluation.

I think there is another revenue of about 2107 million after the whole net. So before the tax is about 32.73 million. We are 27.3.6 billion. So the average US stock price for the whole year is about $9.57. So last year the overall operating we look at the revenue.

We operate in US stocks after tax. I think every project should be included in 2023. Thank you. Then take a look at our balance sheet. We see our bookkeeping cash around 11.51.

Of course, we have some stocks that are for sale. Of course, there are some stocks that are for sale. That is, the giant base of our investment on the OTC market.

We look at the cash flow of one page activity about 33. 1. There are probably more than 300 million taxes paid here. In addition, the cash flow of the investment activity is mainly two major items. One is the reduction in our three-month time deposit. And the other is the payment we rent to the new building.

One of the last financing activities is the cash outflow of more than 800 million. This is seen mainly in the second half of last year in April and October. There are about 7 more per share.

Then there was a change in the first quarter. In principle, the first quarter of working day was relatively small. Then the entire quarter was also relatively low consumption. I just reported to you that this is the whole tariff factor. The first quarter actually seems low season. So we estimate that the revenue would be between 30 and 3.2 billion.

The total gross profit margin is now around 48 to 51. I think the cost should be estimated as much as the listing. So our OP Margin will take 21. 9% to 26.5%. I think this is probably a description of the whole of our operations.

I think that time is expected to follow the usual time. Because it is expected to be five months. That first point we will choose Taipei. I think it is near the MRT station. The principle is to choose between Daan or Xin Yi District.
