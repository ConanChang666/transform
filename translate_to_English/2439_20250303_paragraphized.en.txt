Can you hear my voice? Yes, I can. Disliked. Disliked. Disliked your voice seems a little bit. Can you say it again. I'm sure it's my voice here.

Yes, this sounds good. Thank you. We will start the meeting in just a minute.

Well. That's about three points here. That's where we're going to start. We welcome you to join us today. The online legal forum co-organised by Renmin Securities and Meigreen Co., Ltd. is honored to be invited to the President of Meigreen's Spokesperson Huang Zhaoli.

Let's update the company's recent operation outlook. The expected meeting time will be an hour. The presentation will also leave time for the participants to QA after the presentation.

We would like to thank you very much. The online investor sent an email to everyone in the afternoon. Thank you for your participation in the company's corporate briefing for the fourth quarter of 2024. That's probably the case today. First, I'll talk about the overall operation of Q4 in 2024. Next, I'll talk about the state of the whole year in 2024.

Then we will talk about some prospects for Q1 of 2025. There will be some industry conditions throughout the year 2025. There is also a company strategy. That will last for QA. Let's take a look at the fourth quarter of business hours. Good.

That 2024 fourth quarter revenue is 12.3.2 billion. That annual revenue is 438.5.5 billion. That fourth quarter revenue is higher than expected. That was the previous law. The previously predicted Q4 revenue was a slight decline.

But the YOY of Q4 grew by 5% higher than expected. That was the main reason. The first was Mr. Trump's appointment in January. That was before Mr. Trump. That client. That was a very positive pull.

So, the fourth quarter of the year was raised. Next, the gross profit margin for that quarter was 13. 86%. So you can see our gross profit margin. There is a comparison in Q3, about the 23rd year. It is a very special phenomenon.

In fact, our gross profit margin is a gradual increase. The net operating interest rate for the fourth quarter was 4. 19%. That was lower than the three quarters. Mostly because of the two quarters.

One profit in 2024 is better. So we mentioned it in the fourth quarter. More employing fees. That is a number of bonuses for employees. So that's it. The net operating interest rate for that fourth quarter.

That's a bit lower than the previous quarter. But that's tax net interest rate. That's 6. 06 percent. That's better than 5. 53% in the previous quarter. That's a surplus of US stocks.

The fourth quarter was $2.73. Then the return on equity was 14. 94% in 2024. ROA was 7. 01%. Then let's take a look at that profit statement. The fourth quarter's revenue.

Chen Xiao just said 123.5.2 billion. That QOQ was down by 3.92%. That YOY was up by 5. 14% compared to the previous quarter down by 3.92%. That's the main reason. Our high-end headwear design.

There are also esports products. There is another TWS in that year. It is that high season of Christmas. So that the bullion before that high season is more positive. So the pick up in the fourth season is a little slower.

So the entire QOQ was down by 3. 92%. That was a 5.14 percent increase compared to last year. The main reason for that was from the growth of the earphones in the esports industry. There was a growth of TWS.

YOY is 49% growth. That TWS is 48% growth. Well, that esports product. That esports product increase. The main reason is the increase in market demand. That TWS increase.

The main reason is that we are fighting for new customers. One new customer in England. The other is our old customer. There is also one middle-class TWS. The new product is one join. So drive the entire TWS.

In the fourth quarter, 48% increased compared to the same period last year. That's what we're doing with the battery. The hearing aids. And all the product lines of the microphone. In the fourth quarter, YOY also increased. That included the battery parts with new products.

The hearing aid has a large customer of a beauty system. That microphone part. Because we have the new product line of that microphone finished. Includes the live microphone. There is also a corded microphone. So compared to last year.

Our entire microphone has a relatively large growth. The gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 13.9%. That QOQ was an increase of 0.4 percentage points. That YOY was an increase of 0.9. That's what I said. That's the main reason.

Because of the increase in the rate of increase. There is also a slight increase in our portfolio. That pushes an increase in the gross profit margin. Of course, one advantage of the exchange rate is also the reason for the increase in gross profit margin. The operating cost of the fourth quarter was 11.9 billion. That QOQ is the 22. 09 percent point.

That YOY was 14. 37 percentage points. The operating profit margin for the fourth quarter was 4. 19%. That QOQ was a decrease of 1.69 percentage points. That YOY was an increase of 0.08 percentage points. The out-of-pocket revenue for the fourth quarter was 4.56 percentage points. That was the increase of 318. 3 percentage points in the previous quarter.

That was an increase of 109. 17 percentage points over the same period last year. That was a gain compared to the same period last year for our reinvestment company. That included our most significant. The profit we recognized in the Suzhou plant increased by a little over 1.3 billion compared to the previous quarter. That was a rise of 1929 million compared to the previous quarter. That was because of the interest in exchange rates.

That's the same thing as last year's investment company. We're going to renovate our factory. That's it.

That's it, that's it, that's it.

That was an increase of 5.43 percent compared to the previous quarter. That was an increase of 37.5 percent compared to the same quarter last year. That was 6.02 percent compared to the previous quarter. That was an increase of 0.49 percent compared to the previous quarter. That was an increase of 1.66 percent compared to the same quarter last quarter EPS of 2.6%, that was an increase of 0.14 percent compared to the previous quarter, and that was a increase of 0.49 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Then we look at the proportion of that product, that the proportion of the product in the fourth quarter, that the proportion of the proportion is 61 percent, that the proportion of the third quarter was reduced by 7 percent, that the proportion of the speaker accounted for 31 percentage points, that compared to the previous quarter was an increase of TW. The part of the speaker, compared to the same period last year was a percentage decline, the main reason for the decrease in the demand of the phone's speaker, but our other classes include headphones and then the Hi-Fi used, HiFi Speaker is the sound of the home, growth ratio is really right, so offset a decline in the proportion of the phone's speaker, that phone's proportion is mainly because our strategy on our phones is a little bit darker, then we take our resources to do the MV, there is also an earphone, there is an MV headphones, that this part can make our second half of the year's production is a relatively balanced point, so we can increase our gross profit rate.

In the previous quarter, the headset fell 16%, the main reason was because of the high-grade headset, the high-grade detachment design, then it was at the end of the third quarter of 2023, that is, it was the fourth quarter of last year, it was more than a year, it was the fourth quarter of last year, and it was the fourth quarter of last year there was a new model to be launched, so the start of the fourth quarter will slowly reduce that market, so the fourth quarter is a little decline. The loudspeaker part of the QoQ was increased by 8%, so the main reason is that the phone, the speaker is in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter is a lot of the new shipment, so the phone is that is the most important reason for that QoQoQ increase, that QoQoQoQ increase is a new product, which is the second year, that the second year, that the latter is the increase is the latter is the increase the number of the number of the number of the number of the latter of the Qo.

The most important thing about gaming is that there is a need for that market, and that TWS is just saying that we have a new customer in the United States, and that there is a new product in the middle, so the TWS increase is a little bit. That compared to the previous quarter, whether the audio gaming or TWS are down, the audio headphones are down 21%, that gaming is down 16%, then TWS is down 7%, the main reason is that the fourth quarter is Christmas, that shopping peak season, the mainland's double Eleven, it's also in the fourth quarter, so at the end of the third quarter, we started to play, so the fourth quarter in the end of October, will reduce a little, so the three categories of the shipment of the headset will be compared to the previous quarter decrease.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into a consistent paragraph while retaining the original order and content.

It may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit and then merging them into paragraphs. First of all, I read the whole transcript to understand the overall content. It looks like this is a report on the financial and operational status of the company, involving the proportional changes in different product categories, the YoY ratio (YoQ) and the ratio of growth rate (QoQ), and the analysis of balance sheet and cash flow statement. Users may want to group this information by topic, such as the proportional changes in each product category first, then YOY and QoQ data, followed by financial indicators such as accounts receivables, inventory, payables, etc., and finally capital expenditure and cash flow.

In the same way, sentences about MV part growth and PC part decline also need to be classified into the same paragraph. It is important to note that there are repeated or redundant words in the original verb, such as "that", "uh", etc., which need to be retained during the conversion because the user requests not to delete anything. In addition, timestamps also need to be retained in the paragraph, but the user may want them to be presented in a more natural way, such as at the beginning of the paragraph or in the appropriate place.

This section involves multiple sentences and requires reasonable segmentation to ensure that the information is coherent. Finally, check that the entire paragraph verbatim conforms to all the requirements of the user: without deleting any sentences, keeping the original order, correct segmentation, retaining all timestamps and original content. At the same time, make sure that the format is correct, without using any Markdown, using only plain text, and separated by empty lines between paragraphs. After the initial draft, I will read again to confirm that each original sentence is correctly placed and the transition between paragraphs is natural.

For example, there are some duplicate "that" or "uh" in the original transcription, which need to be retained during conversion, but the sentence structure can be adjusted appropriately to improve readability without altering the original intention. In summary, the process requires careful handling of each sentence, identifying logical relationships, rational segmentation, and strict adherence to all instructions of the user, ensuring that the final output meets the requirements. </think> is up to 59%. The proportion of the Notebook is raised to 11%. The P1 speaker is down to 4%. The rest is down to 26%.

That is, if we look at the YOY of these four classes. The Fone part is the 22% of that falling down. That Fone has two main reasons. The first reason is, of course, the customer's needs. uh is the market demand is not as much as before. uh is just what we're talking about in our strategy to reduce the volume of the loudspeaker we use on our phone.

That turned that device automation line to make that MV, and the headset, and the uh speaker that we're going to do with that tablet in the future. That's because it allows us to uh around the world year-round that capacity is relatively average. That can help us increase that gross profit margin. The MV part of YOY is an increase of 131%. That's mainly an increase in that market demand.

That's mainly a drop in the market demand for the uh. The other category of YOY is an increase of 30%. That's mainly the uh demand for the speaker that we're using for the headphones is increased.

Another one we have is a speaker with a subwoofer. That's a new product line for our products. One of the additions to that product line to that YOY is a relatively large growth. That is, if it is compared to the previous quarter. That phone is an increase of 19%.

That's why the mobile phone has a relatively large growth in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter or the fourth quarter. The NV part has grown by 13 percent. This is a urethra increase in the market demand. The PC part is that the QoQ was reduced by 19 percent.

That's mainly because we just talked about a product line that has such an impact on the subwoofer. That's where his shipment is less than the previous quarter. The main reason is that our customers are in the second half of the year he's going to make a change. That's why our shipment is slowly reduced. Next, let's take a look at the balance sheet and an important financial indicator.

That's because the fourth quarter of our revenue is good. The main growth comes from that eh, which is a customer who is coming up with a longer weather. So the number of days the eh pays is increased by one day. The weekday of the inventory is reduced by seven days. The eh, because the eh is more shipped, so the inventory is less. The other is the first quarter compared to the third quarter is a little less.

That's why there's no need to prepare so much. That's why the eh our inventory week is increasing the number of days. Our inventory week is going to be lower. That's a 10 day decrease. That's because that eh is the proportion of the long-term payment. That's why the entire cash week is 4 days higher than the previous quarter.

We can see that the main items in the table are cash receivables and stock. The cash receivables part is 85.87 billion. The cash receivables part is 117.100 million. The stock is 48.600 million.

That's mainly because we have issued a three-year cb and cash appreciation. So the level of the cash on the account will be a little more. That uh receivables part of the decrease last quarter is because the uh last quarter revenue is more good. Some of our accounts have expired. That's more than the same period last year. The main reason is that uh receivables in the fourth quarter of our revenues are higher than the same period last year.

That's why our receivables are slightly smaller than the previous quarter. The main reason for that is because we are a bit smaller in the first quarter. So, the amount to be expected is a bit lower. That's why we're more likely to grow more than the same year. That's because we've created a new cv to repay our short-term bank loans.

That's why our current current liabilities are reduced compared to the same period last year. That's part of the non-current liabilities because we've given a three-year baptism. Well, that's why our non-current liabilities are increased compared to the same period last year. Well, let's take a look at that cash flow statement.

Our capital expenditure is much more than in the past. Our capital expenditure is 5.6.8 billion. The main part is that we have a factory in Thailand. The second factory in Thailand is mainly due to the demand of the overseas supply of the eh customers.

That's why customers now ask us to go shopping in Thailand and then our demand is higher. So there is now a second plant in Thailand that is being built. So this capital expenditure is to supplement the land of the second plant in Thailand, and the handroom and equipment. The other part of Vietnam is also because there are some products that are going to be produced from China to Vietnam.

This quarter's own cash flow is the cash flow of our business activities to deduct our capital expenditure. That own cash flow is $4500 million. That's the fourth quarter of that year's operating results. We now look at overall's operating condition for the entire two-year period. That 2024 EPS is 9:26. The overall performance is really a good thing.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription after rehearsal: The main reason is that uh we are in 2023, when we determine the entire direction of 2024, the operating policy of our time is revenue-oriented, that diversity development, that AI empowers with net zero sustainability, that is, in all respects. In fact, we do not do well, the good performance of uh will appear on our financial data. That we are in revenue-oriented, we are through the optimization of our internal operations, that we improve our operations, that our competitive price of uh, that our active approach customers, so we have a 20% increase in revenue throughout the year. In addition to the demand for the head-mounted headset market is stable growth, the more and the more models we have in our main customers, in addition to the existing customer is the uh, we have a new product line, and the good display.

The first product is called the microphone, which is the live microphone, there is also a clip-on microphone, and then there is a bluetooth speaker, and there is a middle and low bass speaker. In the new customer section, we have a high-end machine, a customer who has added this new cause, that earphone, that earphone, that earphone, which is almost all the world's five esports earphones, are our customers. So in the new product and new customers, the revenue ratio of our revenue is increased year by year, the other is optimized throughout the entire operation, because we use A I to empower the power, so we use AI tools to make our factory the efficiency of that drive, and then the customer service has improved.

In addition to this, we are close to the age of sustainability, and that there is also good results, including that we took that 2024, the top 5% of the corporate governance of the listed companies, and we recently selected the Dow Jones Sustainability Yearbook. The whole process is only 780, the only 70 companies in Taiwan selected, so OBO, our revenue in 2024 is 438.55 billion, and YOY is 9.53%. The main reason for the increase is that the first is increased by 26%, the headset is increased by 26%, the entertainment headset market is stable growth, the other is the demand of the electronic gaming earphone market is also good.

One of the other things I've just mentioned is that we have a new product for the subwoofer, so even though the speaker is used to reduce the speaker, the other is added, so the whole speaker has an increase of 4% year-on-year. The battery part is 63% increase, that is, the battery battery customer, the one that had an inventory problem, the one that had it removed, and we also got several new products. So compared to the 63% growth in 2023, the hearing aid has grown 88%, and that's what I just said about the whole medical sector, that's the one that's intensified, the trend of OTC hearing aids, the more and more companies need this hearing aid.

As a result of the addition of the two product lines, the overall gross margin of 2024 was 13.3%, which, as I said, is a year-on-year increase. The reason is because the first, our operation optimization, the increase in the rate of increase, the better the product portfolio, the advantage of the exchange rate, is that we have improved the gross margin, which is 4.25%.

The net profit before tax is 31.500 million, which is an increase of 67. 16% from the same period last year. That is, in addition to the increase in operating interest rates, the other part of the industry is also increased, the outside part is from the increase in investment funds, and also from the exchange of a benefit. So the result of the whole 2024 is quite good, the DPS is 9. 26%, which is an increase of 3.1 from the same period last year.

In addition to the date of this board, it also reported to us that some of the results of our entire 2024 corporate governance, the Pearl just said that in addition to the good business, we did not do well, so we got the MSCI ESG of that rating is A, then we also won the top 5% of the corporate governance evaluation of listed companies in Taiwan, then we recently also got the DJSI knives sustainable yearbook, the sustainable yearbook, the selected sustainable yearbook, then we also passed a review of that SBTI science-based inspection, then, we are to report to you, is the first quarter of the first quarter of 2025 of the outlook, the first quarter of 2025 will slightly increase compared to the same period last year, the profit will also increase compared to the same period of the same period of the same year, the gross profit will also be a slight improvement, the last year of the last year of the last quarter of the wool rate is 12. In addition to the new products, the new product line will increase more than last year's same time, that earphone delivery is very reduced, let the earphones drop more than the same time last year's same time, the average earphone delivery is more than the average drop, the main reason is because the fourth quarter has been pulled, some of the products to change this year's this year's game-level communication earphones is the audio, and then the Gaming section will fall later than the same time last year's same year's same year's same year's same year's same year's growth, the new product will be more than the same as the same as the last year's new product, then the next year's sales will be more than the same year's bigger than the same year's competition, and the same year's the same year's the same year's sales will be the same, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the next year's, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the new product, the same as the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the new product, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the This year, the demand for hearing aids is really advantageous, so the demand for this section of our hearing aids is increased, the other is that now, we all need AI, so the demand for this kind of microphone sensor is increased, so our microphone, whether this kind of microphone or this kind of sensor, he will be more than in the past, so this year, our company's strategy, in fact, the company's innovation and transformation of the order.

This is why we have a lot of influence on the U.S. and the U.S., because we do not currently have a Vietnamese factory. At present, it is a situation that has been the case since Trump is the first Trump zero implementation of the tariff, so it is also a fact that at present, Mr. Trump's influence is just that we have to force our customers to quickly move some of the models produced in that Thailand or the ones we want to produce directly in the future, so it is not a big problem for us to not have a lot of impact on our revenue, but we will have a lot of impact on our operations, because we have to have a lot of people to support the operation of the factory overseas, which really is a big challenge for us. We are about 80% the big customer in North America, that big customer, we were early to do the PC and NB speaker, and then we cut into the phone, then we made the headset, and that VR, and then there is the size of the speaker, so because we are all going to automate the line, so we will put more automation lines in the past to do the phone, then this is the strategy is this, my phone just got enough of that model, we have five models in a year, now we have a strategy we pick up four models, but this, we do this automation line, that is, it has a tag that thing, next year we will do the tablet, that it has changed, that it is that it has changed, that thing, then next year we will do the same thing with the third season of the next year. It's a good idea to know if this is the right place for you. It's the right place for you. It's the right place for you. It's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you, it's the right place for you.

The second is that for us is more advantageous is that our Suzhou factory is a partner cooperation with U.S.A., the more customers assemble, the more we get this component will be the proportion of the more, that is to understand, that is, the new model of the new year, is to be launched, that is, he said that in this part of the speaker product is also to be redesigned, that there is no requirement in the specification that uh is different from the previous generation, or the requirement is more finer and better specifications. uh, that he will be different from each generation, because the sound is different, because the sound of you are different, your speaker will be different, but he is not the very different, just your mold, to be re-opened, and even some new components or new manufacturing processes, but this will not affect his profit.

It's a big deal, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, then it's a big investment, then it's not a big investment, so you're starting to get a big investment, it's a big investment, it's a big investment, so you's starting to get a lot of investment, that's why this tablet is a big scale, it's out of the three, it's out of the three, then it's the one that's out of the three, it's out of the three, it's out of the three, then it's out of the three, we'll get a lot of it?

This is the best way to grow the product. Then there are some B markings, what is the best way to grow the product, and then there are some B markings, what is the growth of a product rains, a product Spit Pro, needs a delicate need to be maintained, so this system is a major standard of knowledge, the machine is relatively low, so growth is relatively high, must be this microphone product, with that hearing aid, because the headset is too large, but we expect that a growth of the headset, will be higher than that of the speaker, because the speaker is mainly the customer of North America.
