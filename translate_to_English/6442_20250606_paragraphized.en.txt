In fact, we all know that our company is in fact very good condition last year. Last year, our company's revenue in agricultural rates and EPS made a record high. It included the confidence of 2020 formulas to encourage those shareholders to pass this is also our US stock formula 8.6. It also passed those shareholders, which is also the new high in our history.

This year, we also wanted to give back to our shareholders and investors a better result. Today, the main presentation is probably four main main threads. The first is to report on the actual performance of our 2024 words. Then, let's talk about our company's current production points. The third is the profit-making and market momentum of the company's products.

The first thing we can see here is that I have done a comparison with you in the last three years or the three years of 2022 to 2024. That can see our presentation on the left side of the revenue portion is actually about 30 billion in 2022 and around 30 billion in 2023. The whole revenue in 2024 suddenly increased from 2.6 billion in 2023 to about 3.4 billion in 2024. The growth of 140 million in 2024 should be about 14% growth.

In fact, we can feel that the demand for this product in the market is actually only about 85% of the total revenue in 2024, so we can prove that this AI is the whole mainstream of the market in the future. The other thing is that in the upper right-hand section of the pre-tax prison can actually see that the pre-tax benefit in 2024 is about 1.4 billion, so it is actually significantly increased compared to the previous two years. The US stock market in 2024 is about 14.300 million words in 2024, because the passive data manufacturer's products are part of a relatively high price range.

In the first quarter of 2020, the gross profit margin was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2020. However, in April and back to more than 50% of the first quarter of May, it should be said that the gross profit margin should be back to above 50%. The EPS in the first quarter of this year is 4. 26 that 4. 26. 26 that we are only the higher part of our single quarter in the first quarter of 2023.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed. The user emphasizes that all the sentences must be retained, so I want to check them one by one to make sure there are no omissions. Next, I will analyze the transcription fragments provided.

First of all, I need to identify the sentences corresponding to each timestamp and group them logically. For example, the parts of the flow ratio and the debt ratio can be combined into a paragraph, followed by the data of the pay ratio, and then a change in the net US stock value. After that, the description of the company's global operations, including the situation in Taiwan, China, the Philippines, and the Czech Republic.

Also, pay attention to the "do not delete any sentences" mentioned by the user, so even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant, such as "Hunglin" multiple times, they need to be retained. At the same time, pay attention to the correct mapping of timestamps to ensure that the position of each sentence is accurate. Finally, check whether the entire converted paragraph is smooth and meets the requirements of the user. Make sure that there is no missing any sentences, and that each paragraph is structured and logically clear.

In fact, the flow ratio is about 170% more than that. So, in fact, the relative seemingly debt ratio is still healthy. The previous pay ratio, because the operation continues to make a profit, so the previous pay ratio is actually in fact, 2025 8 billion, that in 2020 3.80 million, it is higher than the past. The last part of the net worth of the U.S. stocks here, the net worth of the U.S. stocks, in fact, is actually increased by the operating profit, so the first quarter of 2020, because there are some parts of the operating distribution of the cash stocks, so there are some classifications, so its net value is slightly lower, but still close to 46 47, close to 50 levels.

That's because, after all, it's a cost-effective part of making home-made products, and I think it's going to increase our burden slowly. So in fact, in the second half of the year, when we talk about the Philippines, we actually thought we had a subsidiary in the Philippines before the pandemic, so we told our Chairman at the time of our impression that I wanted to go to a factory in the Philippines, and then we said that it was easy to think that after the pandemic is over, and then after the pandemic, about four years have passed, and it's not easy for us to suggest that there was a continuation of the US-China trade war, and Mr. Trump was elected, so we want to say that the Philippines subsidiary will not have to complete it as soon as possible, so the efforts in the second half of July include some local government agencies, including plant decorations, and so the current completion of the entire completion record is close to be close to 100%. In fact, many people in the Philippines initially said that we want to set up the Philippines when a lot of peers or many other customers said why we want to set up the Philippines is not very few companies in the Philippines, and its supply chain may be relatively the same, but now I think it is actually right to look at the Philippines, because the former frontier Trump's tariff policy in early April can not come down after the fact that the Philippines' tax rate is only next to Singapore, so if the original intention is to follow some of the companies to Vietnam to Malaysia may now set up this subsidiary is equal to a white run, but because now, for example, no matter how many governments negotiate with the United States at the moment, there is at least a risk factor in the Philippines, then because the Philippines has almost a lot of its population dividends and its cost is also relatively low compared to the mainland.

Then, in the future, because the Czech factory in fact, we merged with the Czech factory, its factory, and then it became our company, the current word, and the staff inside it were all the employees left behind in the company, so in fact, we are the industry leader in this industry, so in fact, many of our many products of technical development, collisions, we did some research and development, and then with the words of Taiwan and this side of the mainland to work together to develop some new products, so of course, we can also serve some of our European customers, because after all this is a company, if there are any problems in Europe can also be close service through the Czech side. The company's product part, in fact, is divided into three main products, the three major products passively and high frequency connectors, the above scissors, the left is our RF high frequency connector, that is, the connector is our company, because we know that the light macro construction is actually the former connector, that is, the first two companies merged, the earliest words to do the first thing is that we are the connector this part, it is about 57 years, so basically has been half a century, then 1996, 1997, and so accumulated this connector this technology, in fact, becomes said that although the last twenty-three years of the main connector is in the cable industry, it is really a very very good profit, but with the whole parts of the AI accelerated passive, but then with the relative connector after the whole part of the whole parts of the same year, it will be a lot of the market. Sales doubled, that said, business is not a large proportion, but at least this part of it can be seen that after the two-and-three years of product transformation and optimization, there really are some pecuniary goods in some other areas, including for example, just mentioned such as low-track satellite South Korea, this piece is the part of the current investment consensus staff technology, some of our business is done by us, that is because this piece is also the future of some of the mainstream of the market, so in fact, let the RF products have some new development direction. In the past, we agreed that the main light is 2. 5G in the Huawei era, mainly because of the fiber optic props frame, but also because at that time, Huawei also let us have about 4 to 5 years of the company is a good performance of the era, although it was only in the past, how much time has passed, in fact, with the whole European market just mentioned the entire change in the current market now, although the demand has been increased from 2. 5G to 10G, but in fact, after the outbreak of the whole European demand is not as fast as expected, other is a slow part, and in fact, this part of the 10G in our country can also be produced, so it is a very competitive competition, so we gradually want to get out of this 10G, we are also in some other parts of the development of the development of the RF connector to make a transformation, we want to get out of another product in the passive part of the next.

Future computing includes a number of other functions that can be done. Running. So why? So what? Now the speed of the entire part. The action of the whole part is so fast. I think there is a reason for him to exist.

This is what we are talking about in the West. If we talk about Kirin and the Golden Man, it's mainly based on the American natives. In the beginning, it's actually the West American factory. It's back to its history. It's from Taiwan and here.

He started his big data factory. Later because we might actually be us. We do our own products. No matter what the quality of the products is better than his original supplier. So there was one in the back. At that time there was a Singapore logo department and we did the same.

After the Singapore landmark was completed. Later after the Biden government's infrastructure came up. Together with the AI began. After that, all the major manufacturers began building it in the United States.

So this part turns out to be true. You see the United States a few weeks from the beginning of the year. Now it's going to be ten weeks. So why is the pull power so much more powerful now? Because sometimes there's a time to notify a few weeks. The pull power is very strong.

In addition, most of the goods may now be empty prints. Before going to sea prints. Recently, it has been empty prints since about the second half of the year. What does empty prints mean?

Because it takes about half a month to get to the U.S., you still have to go to the outback road in the U.S., you have to go to a seat again. So that's actually a long time. There are many reasons why it is possible now. Their data center may have some planning equipment requirements.

There are many ways to do this, but there are many ways to do this, and there are many ways to do this, and there are many ways to do that, and there are many ways to do that, and there are many ways to do that.

There are many of them who say, "This is the way, walk ye in it," and they say, "This is the way, walk ye in it," and they say, "This is the way, walk ye in it."

This is because the whole AI is now provisioning. You are part of the big company. It is still provisioning. In fact, it will continue to be provisioning. They will also compare between the big companies. Of course no one wants to lose to anyone.

This is not going to be caught up by China to the leader. So I think that should be the main consideration too. So even if the tariffs are now down to 4%, the current pulls are not due to the impact of tariffs. And there is a delay or slowing part. Instead, the pull is more positive.

This is part of what we feel right now. It's probably just the part of our main three product lines in front of it. It's probably the ability of our entire product to be applied. It's actually quite broad. It's included in the 5G communication section here. There's another general data center that's still in use.

The part of 5G finance is more obvious to us. There is a weld box here. As far as the weld box is concerned, it has some cooperation cases. As before, it was like the plastic parts of the Yongying number. That is to use some of our equipment. That is, the future is still like the future of possible F16.

It is not an F16 improvement in Taiwan at the moment. In fact, there is something in the future improvement section that will be used for our products. There are also automotive parts. The automotive section will be used for some parts of the connector. This includes parts such as optical detection and sound.

There is a verse in the Qur'an that says: "And We have indeed made it easy for you to do so, and indeed, We have made it easy for you to do so, and indeed, We have made it easy for you to do so."

From. From. Some development with customers to our own self-manufacturing. The manufacture of the self-manufacturing machine. There are also processing of the entire product, etc. Until the final assembly and testing.

In fact, we can all be one company. It is possible to complete the entire part of the finished product in one go. That is also some of the things we have accumulated for about 50 years. There are some practical experiences after that. There are also today this man can develop these products.

After 20, 50 years of ties with these crafts. So help customers when designing and developing. We all have that one. The efficiency process is relatively faster. Of course, just mentioned.

The quality of the certification is important. That is, every product you go out of the wrong way, and that is to say that some of them also meet the requirements of some of the local specifications.

We are all in this together, and we are all in this together. We are all in this together, and we are all in this together. We are all in this together, and we are all in this together, and we are all in this together, and we are all in this together.

The patent section sometimes changes slightly. If the change is different, there will be a patent. Or a problem with the curve. That company we have about every year. There will be about 120 parts of this patent.

So from accumulating to the present moment, there are about 80 parts of this patent. That patent, of course, is in the United States and America. China in every local country where there are customers. We will apply for these patents. What is the future of this part?

In fact, it was just mentioned. AI. It should be said to the U.S. infrastructure. If the impression is correct, it starts from the second half of the year. So if you now see the part that is about to enter the second year.

That is, if there is an infrastructure. Although Biden is not re-elected, the Trump administration's speech will follow. That will continue for the next 30 years.

Here's a re-arranged paragraph verbatim: Let's keep this American infrastructure going. So in this section we're going to continue. We have some of our customers here, some of our orders.

In addition, in this part of the AI, there is the need for these equipments in this data center. So in fact, since seven years ago, the total revenue of the big data center with the United States is a very blurred growth. In the previous years, it should be said that in 2023, about 2023, the company's sales amount is about about about about about about $150, about $1 billion, about $1 billion, about $1 billion in 2023.

If it can be halved or even dropped to 10%, then the positive part of this tariff 18 can be tolerated for us, because after all, the gross profit or the relative gross margin is relatively high, or it can be tolerated. I think that this depends on the government and the U.S. government, and how to talk about the hope that there will be a negotiated outcome soon. Of course, if the tariff is a future case, then the tariff part of the future is the case, and after Mr. Trump issued the tariff policy, we actually have some ongoing communication with the US customers, including some discussion on how the tariff part of how to solve it. So there may be a possibility that it may be absorbed by our customers in the future, it may be said that the part of it will not have a big impact on us.

In the past, it was said that it might fall to 28, or even a group of 28 bottoms, then I would like to say that this is very sad, because in fact, from 32 to 28, it lost more than 5 pieces, the 5 more large companies, the 5 more large foreign currency parts, the fact that I want to say for a business, should not be able to bear the part of such a huge loss. According to our company, there is also the fact that in fact, before that time there was a high, single page 1. 12, the actual word is because there are business divisions, there are actually a lot of exchange losses caused. If it is going back in the year, it is likely that the single page, the EBS can be about 28, close to the three parts.

So, if it falls to a certain part of this loss, I think the latter part of the loss, relatively little impact. That is, it is now new, the new, these actual pick-up parts, will actually use the current profit, to quote the customer, so it will not say that the part, has been accumulated all the time. Of course, for the purpose of this part of the loss, we have to avoid it naturally, that is, there may be some in the first year, in the case of the company, and that is, in the relatively good period of the exchange, I will exchange it for dollars, and then transfer some of the relatively high interest rate of some of the fixed losses.

Hello, Mr. Jackson, the online operator of Casey, first ask three questions. The first is in response to the US President Trump's tariff policy, does the company have a financial and business impact? This is a slight mention of the tariff policy section, in fact, in addition to the positive discussion with our US system customers, is to see how to solve this tax, this tariff section, the cost is how to absorb it. Then again, we just mentioned that we also have another company in the Philippines, in the future if we say that the tax rate here in Taiwan or that there is some tax rate in China, we can at least have a new production base in the Philippines, as a record can reduce our tariff.

The second problem is the recent currency appreciation.



<think> OK, the user let me translate a paragraph-by-text text into paragraph-based text and not delete anything. First of all, I need to confirm what the original data is for the user. The example given to the user is [2676. 60-2677. 60] Thank you, it looks like a timestamp and the corresponding dialogue content. The user wants to organize such content into paragraph-based form, but keep the original sentence intact. Next, I need to understand the user's needs.

However, the key point is that you cannot delete or rewrite anything, you must keep it as it is. Then, I need to consider how to deal with timestamps. In the example provided by the user, the timestamp is [2676. 60-2677. 60], which may indicate conversational content from 2676. 60 seconds to 2677. 60 seconds. Do you need to keep timestamps when finishing paragraphs? The user is not explicitly stated, but depending on the output of the example, the user may want to keep timestamps, but may not need to be shown in the paragraph.

However, the output in the example does not have a timestamp, so users may want to remove the timestamp and only keep the conversation content. But this needs to be confirmed. In addition, the user mentions a "separated script", which may be the raw data of each sentence have timestamps, and now needs to merge these sentences into paragraphs, but maintain the order and integrity of the sentence. For example, if there are multiple sentences belonging to the same person's speaking, it may be necessary to merge them into a paragraph while different people speak separately.

The input is [2676. 60-2677. 60] Thank you, the output is "thank you." It looks like the user wants to remove the timestamp, only retain the dialogue content, and each sentence is merged into a paragraph. But the example has only one sentence, so the output is a separate sentence. If there are multiple sentences, it may be necessary to merge them into paragraphs, separated by a line of phrases, or different paragraphs.

For example, if there are three timestamps corresponding to a sentence, merge them into three paragraphs, each of which corresponds to a timestamp's content. A user may wish to separate each timestamp from the corresponding sentence, so that it is clearer when reading. Therefore, the process step should be: remove timestamps, keep the conversation content, each original sentence as a separate paragraph, separated by a line. However, it is necessary to check whether each timestamp corresponds to a speaker or a speaking paragraph.

In addition, the user may want to keep timestamps, but the output in the example does not have timestamps, so the user may want to remove the timestamp. It is necessary to confirm this, but according to the example, the output is "thank you" and the timestamp entered is omitted, so the treatment is to remove the timestamp, only retain the conversation content, and each sentence as a separate paragraph.

Now it is necessary to verify that this processing conforms to the user's request. The user's example, the input is timestamped "thank you", the output is "thank you", so the processing is correct. If there are multiple sentences, for example: [2676. 60-2677. 60] Thank you. [2678. 00-2679. 00]

Thank you. Not polite. Each sentence is a paragraph alone, and there is no timestamp to meet the requirements of the user. Therefore, the correct way to do this is to remove timestamps, keep the original sentences, and sort them into paragraphs in order.
