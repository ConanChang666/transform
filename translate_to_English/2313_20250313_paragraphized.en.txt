Hello, everyone. Welcome to Huatong Computer Co., Ltd. corporate meeting. Today I am honored to invite Mr. Lu Fan, CFO and Mr. Lee, investor relations manager to share with us the company's current situation. I think we will pass on to the CFO from the beginning. Thank you.

First of all, I would like to thank Fubon Securities for providing such a great place and opportunity so that we can communicate with you about the current situation of the company. Next, I would like to report the contents of the briefing with you.

Soft and hard composite board with SMT. Here. In the part of the hardboard. Now we have a focus on so-called satellites. Data Center with light modules. This is the part we are actively developing.

We are still able to maintain a stable current volume. Last year's global PPV ranking was the seventh. Last year was a revenue of 72.4 billion. The negative revenue growth rate was 7.3% compared to 2014 to 2014.

We currently have 18000 employees. There is a factory with 8 seats. There is already a factory in Thailand. It was officially mass production in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the distribution of one of our global factories. It may be important to see the part of our factory in Thailand.

There are about 780 employees in the factory in Thailand. We will gradually reach 1000 people of this size. This year we will report with you as before. The capacity of our factory in Thailand should be 400,000. But we will invest in it in phases.

But with the needs of today's customers, it is possible that this year will start to reach $40 million. One way to invest in this type of investment will be a bit faster than the original one.

At the same time, we will apply again with the BOI authorities in Thailand. In this phase of the plant. Because the needs of the customer are more than a few. So we will expand the capacity of the whole plant slightly. It may be the final process of our phase of the plant. It may be extended to 50 to 60 million.

In the end, even in the finish section, there may be more. This is enough to meet one of our customers' needs. Other parts of the factory talk. There is no large expansion plan.

But there's always something new every year. Another key point may be in our soft board factory in Huizhou. The soft board factory in Huizhou will continue to expand this year. Take a look at a situation we've had in the past year.

We're on the softboard every year. We're still doing a small expansion. Because at the moment, we see the PriestMark data for ourselves. Let's all share it. That's where we are now in the global ranking.

We have not been able to do this for seven years, but we have been able to do it for seven years, and we have been able to do it for seven years, and we have been able to do it for seven years, and we have been able to do it for seven years, and we have been able to do it for seven years.

Although we have ranked 7th in the world. But in fact, the global market share and ranking. And one of the revenues from our main guests. A share is still very low. That is, we are in addition to the top three soft board companies. The top three are the real Dingdongshan precision and conglomerate.

In addition to these three, we are actually behind them. Although we are close to him in the ranking, in fact, there are more than double the difference in his capacity. Even more than three times the difference, so in this case it is true for us.

There are a few other things to keep in mind. If you want to continue to be able to maintain on the whole position of your guests. In fact, it is still necessary to expand. That is why our soft boards will continue to do an expanded action. We hope that our soft boards are on top of technology.

We believe that after 20 years of development. There should be a tier1 level already. But we are currently on either the market share or all of the rankings above. It may be now or the so-called tier2. But it is already in front of us. So we expect that we will be able to expand in the future.

This is one of the expectations of our own soft board. That is why we also announced on the service. We are going from the soft board in Huizhou. We are planning to set up the capacity of the soft board in Thailand.

Because it is just mentioned. The expansion of the soft board is already in need of a new plant. Because we are already in our factory in Huizhou. It will be full in about two years.

The whole world is facing a situation. If you want to build a new plant, it may not be suitable to continue to expand here in China. So we want to be outside of China.

That way you can use one of our original resources at our factory in Thailand. Our new factory will be built in the same position as our factory in Thailand. Come and share our so-called one. To maximize this benefit, so this is our current plan. So it looks like we are in the same position.

The hardboard part is mainly an investment in a factory in Thailand. The softboard part is now only a small part in the factory in Huizhou.

Future plans. Satellites. Satellites. Satellites. We believe that there will still be a kinetic energy that continues to grow. Mainly in the original customer section.

Although there will be some new suppliers to join, but because of his total growth, he still has a lot. So this is a larger customer. It should still maintain a growth trend. But he has a lot of machines for us. So the growth rate is not so big.

But we have another satellite guest. This year there will be some real movement. And the parts of the plan. So this part. We think we are the whole satellite. Our own optimistic forecast is.

At least 20%, this is a situation in which we're on this part of the satellite. The other words we're actively working on are this part.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will analyze the verbatim fragments provided by the verbatim. Each sentence has a timestamp, and I need to determine which sentences belong to the same paragraph according to the continuity of the timestamp.

For example, some sentences may start with "that", which may mean that they are the continuation of the previous sentence and should be merged into the same paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences, to ensure that paragraphs are reasonable and consistent. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the "do not delete any sentences" mentioned by the user, so even if some sentences look redundant or duplicate, it must be retained.

Also, pay attention to the interval between the timestamps. If the timestamps between the two sentences are larger, it may mean that they belong to different paragraphs. For example, [486. 30-488. 30] to [488. 30-491. 30] is continuous, while [498. 30-502. 30] to [502. 30-504. 30] is also continuous, but there may be other paragraphs in the middle.

At the same time, ensure that paragraph segmentation is reasonable, easy to read and understand, in line with the requirements of users. </think> This section contains a wide range of services, including an AI server in this high-level, that includes light module communication, and this data center in this place. It is probably the last year of this spell also reported to you, in fact, Huatong in this place, now is very hard, the main reason is that there are more and more trends in this section, there is now a way to design HDI.

This is a situation that we have just mentioned, in the current capacity of the HDI, or very large, so this is our opportunity, because the current situation of the HDI is very much ignored now, and in this field just said, it should be very strong, but we have an advantage is that we have a very large capacity outside of China, okay, this is a big advantage for us. That is another oil plant, this, there is the same outside of China has a lot of HDI capacity, this oil plant, and now is a large customer in the world, so in this case, this is our center, I think in this field, we should be looking at the current point, satellite, but for us, we have been very high, we have just talked about, this part, this part of the future growth is a bigger part, we are now a part of what we are currently in the second part of the factory, if we are looking for this is a new, whether we are the future, this is a new, whether this is a new, this is the future, this is a new, this is the future, this is a new, this is the future, whether we are the future, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new product, this is the future, whether we will be a new, whether we are the future, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, whether we will be a new, this is a new, whether we will be a new, we will be a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, we will be a new, this is a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, we will be a new, this is a new, this is a new, this is a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, we will be a new, this is a new, we will be a new, this is a new, 6%, from 24 to 28 years, that we are also expected, we are involved in a number of areas, should have a growth situation, because the overall layout is generally complete, now is different from ABF no, so overall, the characteristics of this industry is that there will always be new things, some needs, maybe people will come down, there will be products, for us to say, we are prepared, in the past a real situation, we are also facing the competition of consumer HDI prices, with the demand stagnant, so the advantage of Huatong may be that we are very experienced, a very experienced company, can not say it is old, but actually very old, so in a variety of challenges, in fact, in a very serious situation, we can still maintain such a growth, this is our advantage, I believe in the future part, we can still grasp a lot of opportunities to create a better growth.
