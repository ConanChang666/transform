<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided transcription fragment to see if there are duplicate or formatting issues. For example, notice that there are spaces between timestamps, and some do not, which may affect subsequent layouts.

In addition, some sentences may be duplicated, such as "up to 8.7 percent growth in all product categories", but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so it is necessary to keep all duplicated parts. Then, I need to reorganize the verbally separated verbatim into paragraphs. This needs to identify the natural segmentation point, usually when the topic transitions or speaker changes. For example, the welcome word and introduction section at the start of the meeting can be merged into a paragraph, followed by a sharing of market information, followed by an analysis of the operational profile, each part as a separate paragraph.

According to the example provided by the user, they seem to want to keep timestamps, so it is necessary to ensure that each sentence's timestamp corresponds correctly and remains the same after the conversion. Also, it is necessary to check for typographical or format errors. For example, "quiet" in the original text may be a miswrite of a name, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so it must be kept as it is.

In addition, some sentences may have spaces between timestamps and need a uniform format to ensure consistency. During the process, pay attention to the consistency of the sentences. For example, some sentences may appear sturdy after conversion, but they cannot be rewritten according to the user's requirements, so the order and structure of the original sentence must be maintained. For example, "2025 and 2026 are 3.3%" followed by "3.7% below historical average", which may fall under the same paragraph and need to be merged.

In summary, the process requires careful handling of each sentence to ensure that nothing is missing and that the paragraph structure is properly organized, so that the final transcription is both in line with the requirements of the user and is easy to read. </think> The following is a structured paragraph verbatim transcription (fully retains all the original content, only adjusts the layout and paragraph structure):

First of all, I would like to introduce to you the presenter of today's meeting is Mr. Lau Kwok King. The procedure for the meeting will be the company's briefing, and the Q&A will be carried out. In the process of briefing, if there are any questions, please enter into the chat window.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, sorting them into paragraph transcripts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription provided by a sentence in a sentence, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

For example, the price dynamics and learning curves of a Thai plant can be combined into one paragraph, while the parts of the gross profit margin and product portfolio changes can be combined into another paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are consistent over time. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the "do not delete any one sentence" mentioned by the user, so even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant, it must be kept completely.

In addition, there are some non-Chinese content in the transcripts provided by the user, such as "marsupial Kita" and "passive", as well as some possible garbled or irrelevant content such as "vite exterinate" and "bottles". According to the user's request, these content must also be retained, which cannot be deleted or modified. Therefore, when finishing, it is necessary to separate the sections or group them according to the context reasonably. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph transcripts to check whether all the original sentences are properly preserved without omissions or errors. At the same time, make sure that the transition between paragraphs are natural, logically clear, and in line with the user's requirements.

The following is the collated paragraph verbatim script (totally retain all the original sentences, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed anything): --- as well as the changes in the product portfolio. Factors such as the decrease in HDI.

Gross profit margin is still affected. Thailand factory production is expected to have an amazing impact. It is expected that as Thailand factory learning curve will rise. It is expected that as Thailand factory learning curve will rise, and high-end products will be added in the second half of the year. And high-end products will be added in the second half of the year.
