Following the company's financial situation in the first quarter, Mr. Chen, the vice president of the finance department, to report to you. Finally, Mr. Wang Chun-yin, the chief vice president of the industry, and the company's business development.

The presentation section of that day. In the company we are divided into four issues. The first is the current situation of the company. The second is the financial information. The third is the industry outlook. The fourth is the operational strategy.

That's where the company is. Compared to last year's average. In terms of repairs. Our company still maintains 16 country repair licenses. In terms of number of jobs. Compared to last year.

This year, about 100 people have been increased. And it is still in the recruitment. If the maintenance value of the aircraft is more than 300 times, this year will be more than 300 times. If the temporary maintenance value. In terms of development.

There will be more than 2 billion companies. In engineering. There will be more than 2 billion companies. Then in intermediate. There will be more than 2 billion companies. In engineering.

There will be more than 2 billion companies. That is, in the construction and manufacturing of production hours. There will be more than 25 million production hours. In the aviation industry special process certification. There are currently 29. The world's main customers.

There are more than 30. In last year's statistics section, we were the 8th in the world. The number of deliveries made by the parts. More than 40,000 shipments per year.

That's it. I'm the Finance Department Chen enlightened. I'm here today to report on the financial situation of our company in the first quarter. Here we're here to look at the first quarter of this year's profit statement. Our revenue in the first quarter came at $41.9 billion.

The operating cost is 31.9 million. That is, the gross profit is 51.9 billion. That is, the net profit is 803 trillion. That is, the net profit is 850 million. That is, the net profit is 5.80 million.

In the first quarter of this year, the operating results of such operations were 1.49 yuan per share. The right side of that is targeted. That is the part of the total revenue I think. That is, we are divided into repairs and manufacturing.

The repair business is in revenue. The ratio is about 80%. One of the following two biscuits is for repair business and one of his manufacturing business. One of the revenues of each category. That is, in the first quarter of the manufacturing business, the engine business is in revenue.

85% of that body is 10%. That's part of the repair business. That's part of the repair business. That's part of the repair business. 6 percent. That's part of the online repair business. That's part of the revenue in the repair business.

This part of the repair of the parts is up to 10%. That is. One condition of a low-level revenue that I would like to mention in many investors in this section is also related to these problems. The next page is what we have done in the past three years.

The highest peak of course is to the 4th quarter of 2024. It is up to 475 million. I think this part is to explain here. Last year we had some adjustments to the price part. And in the end of last year, there were also some like the manufacturer there. No.

There are customers with this factor of pull-ups, so this is the fourth quarter of this year's revenue. There is a single quarter of this revenue is relatively high. This is the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. This part is also a lot of growth.

That's the part. In addition to the above mentioned. In addition to the price, the first quarter of the year was also higher than last year's part. So this part.

I would like to go back here to say, but also look at the fourth quarter of last year, he said, the gross profit margin to 16% of the year, the total deposit rate is 9% of the year, I think, here I also explain again, that this return is possible with the fourth quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, that is, the same situation.

The U.S. began a tariff war, adding uncertainty to the aviation industry. Short-term reasons, tariff exemptions, rush orders, may slow down in the second half of the year. The short-term stability of passenger transportation, changes in the climate, need to be needed, and continue to be observed. The cycle of passenger freight conditions is usually 9 to 12 months, and it will only reflect the actual needs of repairs, so this year's capacity increase as well as maintenance needs, changrong space, can be maintained, cautious and optimistic.

This is the future of the aerospace industry. It is also the future of the aerospace industry. A commercial aircraft, the demand continues to increase, and aircraft manufacturers strive to increase their capacity to digest new orders. Manufacturers continue to demand supply chains to increase capacity to address supply imbalances, but this short-term delay continues to occur due to the shortage of raw materials and supply shortages. Second, the demand for defense and space expansion, which in the defense industry base set in the development and increase budget, the increase in the domestic aerospace industry, the space component manufacturing, the demand is also increased, the development of the energy of the aerospace industry.

Hello everyone, this is the topic of the recent appreciation of Taiwan dollars, and that is the question of many investors. [1247. 12-1252. 50] Hello everyone, this is the topic of the recent appreciation of Taiwan dollars. [1253. 06-1254. 08] It is also a question of many investors. If an impact on the company's side, it will have a negative impact on the company's profit and loss in the value of Taiwan dollars. [1255. 10-1257. 66] The impact on the company's side is [1259. 96-1260. 48]

[1261. 00-1265. 34] The company's profit and loss is actually in the appreciation of the dollar has a relatively negative effect on us. In summary, the main here I am about to explain to you is because we just mentioned that I'm in the repair and manufacturing here, in fact, most foreign customers. [1267. 40-1269. 18] Summary. [1269. 44-1274. 04] I'm mainly here. [1274. 56-1276. 60] I'm repairing and manufacturing here. [1277. 1279. 94] I'm mostly foreign customers.

The foreign customer is receiving US dollars from him. [1280. 20-1281. 98] The foreign customer is receiving US dollars from him. So I probably have nearly 70% of the operating income of the company. [1282. 80-1287. 66] So I probably almost 70% of the operating income of the company is US dollars.

[1296. 12-1297. 90] The part is also paid in U.S. dollars. So there is a degree of security here, but my receiving part is larger than the payment part. [1298. 42-1304. 56] So there is a degree of security here. [1304. 82-1305. 84] But my receiving part is larger than the payment part. So this part of this part is more negative for the company's profit or loss above the value of Taiwan dollars. [1306. 36-1306. 86]

[1307. 12-1312. 50] So this part of the company's profit or loss is on the basis of some. [1312. 80-1316. 38] It is more negative about our profit or loss in respect of the appreciation of the dollar. That is, if the dollar depreciates a profit or loss of the company, then this part I can ask you to participate in. [1317. 16-1317. 92] That is. [1318. 18-1324. 32] This part of the depreciation of the dollar if it affects a profit or loss of the company. [1324. 58-1326. 12] This part I can request.

[1326. 62-1328. 42] This is the first quarter report published last week. [1328. 68-1332. 76] You can refer to the first quarter report published last week. This is the first quarter report published last week. The 27th quarter report contains information about the company's sensitivity to the exchange rate, which is based on the smooth table in the first quarter of 2025. [1333. 02-1336. 36] The 27th quarter report contains information about the company's sensitivity to exchange rates. [1336. 60-1340. 96]

[1341. 22-1342. 76] Based on the first quarter of 2025. [1343. 06-1344. 34] This smooth table is based on. Of course, if one percent of the dollar depreciation is likely to decrease in the pre-tax economy by about 41 million. [1344. 60-1345. 10] That is. [1345. 62-1351. 76] Of course, if one percent of the dollar depreciation is correct. [1352. 02-1354. 84]

[1356. 36-1359. 44] The pre-tax economy is reduced by about 41 million. That is, I would like to say that after a change in currency and the US dollar, I would like to see the whole international market and the entire foreign currency market here in Taiwan. [1360. 72-1366. 86] Of course, there is a change in currency and the US dollar. [1367. 12-1372. 76] I would like to see the whole foreign currency market here. [1373. 06-1375. 88] The international market is also a change in the whole foreign currency market here in Taiwan.

[1376. 90-1378. 18] This will continue to be observed later. The above explanation is appreciated. [1379. 46-1381. 76] The 4th question is the amount of loss of the long-term company that the company has announced in the first quarter of this year. [1382. 02-1385. 60] The 4th question is [1385. 86-1389. 96] Previously the company announced the first quarter of this year.

[1390. 46-1396. 60] The loss of the long-term profit-seeking company is still very large. This part I ask the Finance Department Assistant Chen Kai-ming to explain the current operation status of the long-term profit-seeking company. [1390. 46-1396. 60] This part I ask the Finance Department Assistant Chen Kai-ming to explain the current operation status of the long-seeking company.

[1403. 06-1409. 20] Here I want to focus on the first quarter, but the whole number is not really good. Here I also explain to you. [1410. 00-1415. 60] Here I also explain to you. That is, of course, last year he stopped working because of quality problems. [1415. 86-1419. 18] That is, of course, last year he stopped working because of quality problems.

[1420. 20-1425. 84] That, but the part of the suspension, in fact, was reworked in December last year. It was only because the relationship between the quality event so that they were related to the relevant competent authority, that is, you are reworked after the quality event. [1426. 10-1431. 22] It was because it was the relationship between the quality event so that they were there. [1431. 98-1432. 76] That is because the relationship between the quality event was there. [1433. 06-1435. 62] The relevant competent authority is the result of a continuous improvement in one of his work.

[1436. 12-1442. 28] The relevant competent authority is going to examine the effectiveness of a work that will continue to improve. That is not only the Taiwan Civil Aviation Authority. [1442. 52-1444. 58] The competent authority today is not only Taiwan. [1444. 84-1447. 90] The Civil Aviation Administration.

In fact, he also has national civil aviation authorities who need the Lord to report their improvement. [1470. 74-1474. 58] In fact, he also has national civil aviation. [1474. 84-1476. 62] The competent authority needs the Lord.

[1476. 88-1479. 18] Report their improvement. In addition to the civil aviation authorities, there are other customers who also have customers here, he will also be with their customers to come to the site to do relevant inspections. [1479. 44-1480. 46] There are other customers besides the civil aviation authorities. [1480. 72-1482. 26] The customer here also will come to the customer to come to the site to do relevant inspections. [1482. 52-1485. 58] In addition to the civil aviation authorities, there are other customers who will also come to the customer to visit the site to do relevant inspections.
