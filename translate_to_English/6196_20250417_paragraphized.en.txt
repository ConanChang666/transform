Mirrors and point bar. 89% of the revenue we've had in the past three months reached 1.33 billion. That's why we didn't announce the Q1 results, but we made 17.57 billion last year. That's because the EPS part was 8.94 last year. The dividend was 6 pieces, but the shareholders' meeting wasn't completed yet.

So there are now 6 pieces of the announcement. The 24 years of level gain and loss please refer to it. This is the last 5 years of our four business groups revenue. The performance of the business. You can see that it is the blue part of the automatic supply system business.

In the years to come, there will be a great reward for us, a great reward for us, and a great reward for those who do good.

The break down to quarterly performance is really average. That's ours from January to March this year. YY is negative 9.27. See you all again. Revenue in the industry. We're probably the whole group now on average in 23 years and 24 years.

81% of the Group's revenue comes from semiconductors. That panel is actually in reality because it compares to slow down over the years. That's because we have to do something else. That's about 45%. That's better than that.

If you have any questions, please raise your hand and we will give you a thank you. The first thing you should look at is asking us about the interest rate this time. The interest rate is slightly higher than I would like to ask about the next one. Payout Ratio is probably the first question.

The second is to ask. Please ask. Because last year we had a lot of pressure in the United States. We look at this here. Would you like to go back or say something later?

We have a lot of accelerating circumstances there for our big customers. I'd like to thank you in advance for answering the first question of the second question. Please answer first, because money is in control of me. How much money is in control of him is more clear.

Of course we all saw it. Last year we made 9 bucks last year. That's what the US lost. That means that if we didn't lose 13 bucks, we made 13 bucks. The company lost a lot of that.

A company that is operating normally. It is impossible to happen again. So of course, we have spent a lot of spirit, including our high. Spending a lot of spirit with our team to organize and then go.

The customer knows that losing money is a lot of reasons why we have to be responsible for ourselves. But at the time of the situation, we just want to do things. So it's not worth the cost to do it first so the customer is also very good.

Thank you for your support. The whole situation is very positive. So of course, I can't just say that by our customers' own efforts, I think this is the current situation. I can only say that.

There are a number of reasons why they are moving forward. The first is that when you are working in a hurry, everyone is. Very, very, very, very rushing forward.

But now, in fact, it is mentioned; it is said; it is said; it is said; it is said; it is said.

A big situation may or may speed up something but basically. Because of his. building is already covered. So the whole step is one. Very. Compare controllable.

This is controllable. What does this mean because we all know it. What Americans can't do. Can't do too much. So all progress is uncontrollable. So that's the case.

We can all be very good with our customers. I think I'm going to go as far as I can. It's definitely a very positive situation because it includes the customer's grasp. So I think we're going to go as far as that. Of course.

That's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it, and that's how we do it.

Of course, we will also take into account the actual needs of cash, if in case, more than 50%. That should be basic.

Then, of course, the fine-tuned part is to look at the actual situation. There are other directors' opinions. Our Board of Directors. We will consider coming in. Thank you.

Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question. Mr. Trump is currently in a state of duty for us. The four product circles will probably be one of them. Thank you. Everyone has an impact on just the direct indirect and long-term issues.

We are all in this together, we are all in this together, we are all in this together, we are all in this together, we are not in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together, we are in this together.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim fragments, sorting them into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity and order of the original text must be maintained.

Then, I need to group these sentences according to logic and context to form a coherent paragraph. For example, part of the tax may need to be merged into one paragraph while part of the time difference is another paragraph. At the same time, be aware of whether the connection between the sentences is natural, whether it is necessary to add a punctuation or adjust the order to enhance readability, but it must be strictly adhered to the requirement that the original sentences are not modified.

In addition, some sentences may repeat or need to adjust the order in order to comply with logic, but the original sentence must remain unchanged. For example, "the first is to say" and "how to say the first" may be a merger, but the user requests not to delete anything, so all the original sentences must be retained. It is also necessary to pay attention to whether the sentences in the timestamp belong to the same topic, such as about the 2008 financial tsunami, and it may be necessary to combine them with subsequent time difference analysis into a paragraph.

He said, "The first thing we have to say is, 'We're not going to be able to do that,' and we're not going to be able to do that, and we're not going to be able to do that.

Don't do it. This is the second best thing you've ever done. You're currently looking at regulations above. It's not going to be taxing the equipment you're going into because you're going to encourage the semiconductor factory to do what you're going to do.

And if he is a prophet, he is a prophet; and if he is a prophet, he is a prophet; and if he is a prophet, he is a prophet, and if he is a prophet, he is a prophet, and if he is a prophet, he is a prophet.

The problem with direct taxation is that it should not be short-term, but it affects everyone.

The end of the world is going to end, the end of the world is not good, come back to us, this is one thing I'm going to talk about, one more thing.

Our company's business. In fact, there are some things. Different companies in different industries actually have poor time. I talk about this most obvious time when I talk about the 2008 financial tsunami. 2008 started like the second quarter of the financial tsunami.

He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of harvest.

But, we all came back in 2001. We didn't come back yet. But your momentum is, you need to know the problem of time difference.

So, this year is not going to be bad, but it's time for me to do this, and I'm pretty sure that's the whole point.

I can't tell you what I think of you. TSMC doesn't have any effect. It's just a few and a few, because it's so powerful. It's a relatively small impact. I think it's the last thing I'm going to do.

This is my personal opinion. Thank you. If you are investing in advanced technology, there is no other problem.
