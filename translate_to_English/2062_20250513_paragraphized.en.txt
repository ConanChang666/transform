The third class of product clusters is decorative equipment, which is also our classroom service, which contains faucet shower systems, the port accessories. The material is mainly core copper and silver. We are currently focusing on metal parts, i.e. core copper products, as well as the finished product assembly of the faucet. This is the picture of it. This part, these are our main customers, as long as they are global brands, or local leading brands, are our main customers. Our customers in North America, as well as European faucet market share of more than 60%.

From a regional perspective, in the first quarter of 2025, 72% of revenue in North America, 14% in Europe, and 13% in Asia. That is, by industry, 89% of revenue in the first quarter of 2025, and 11% in the rest of the world.

In the first quarter of 2025, the proportion of revenue for the new products is 79%, the proportion of revenue for the new products is 79%, and the proportion of revenue for the first quarter of 2025 is 79%, the proportion of revenue for the new products is 79%, and the proportion of revenue for the first quarter of 2025 is 79%. From this part, it can be seen that the revenue for the new products accounted for more than 70%, but also highlights the focus of the new products in this area. From the new products to the full range of solutions, its background is because the cost of this raw material is 1/3 of copper, which is now more stringent on the drinking water regulations, and the trend of the new replacement copper products has also expanded from the United States to the European tap market.

This is because the low label-free product is called a general copper product, because the cost of the low label-free product is about 3% to 13%, the cost of the new label-free product is about 20% to 40% less than the general copper product, and the total cost of the low label-free product can be about 23% to 53%. Gold module product design solution. In response to the European and American standards for water use and low label-free product design, the solution proposed by the copper core of the faucet product structure, with the core of metal appearance, and then with the individual flexible waterway design module, so that the water will not be exposed to lead or nickel, which 100% can meet the standard requirements of the whole product.

The Japanese market is also currently tackling the transformation of the structure of this type of product. Cho Chun Chile has become a full-service provider. The goal of this implementation is to increase the market share of light products solutions; the second, the solution is based on the services of the main product manufacturing; and the third is to meet the needs of customers in a one-stop shopping group. We estimate that Cho Chun's current market share in the kitchen is less than 4%, so we expect enough to increase to 10%.

We want to focus on developing as a comprehensive service provider for new and shaping plastic parts products, while at the same time upgrading OEM component suppliers to ODM finished products, to become OEM component suppliers. Our design solution is based on the overall cost-based solution, OEM component suppliers to meet the needs of one-stop purchase group. This is our strategic blueprint for process automation: we first adopt a single station automation, and then combine each station into a module station automation, and then connect to a module station as a production line automation.

In terms of the development of the assembly capacity, JOSON strengthens the supply chain management, from component process capabilities to assembly finished products, to develop product testing capabilities, and accumulated product certification capabilities, and together with the development of the structure platform and assembly line, the group builds various faucet assembly functions, including the faucet of the basin, the faucet of the kitchen, and the faucet of the shower, to become the solution provider.
