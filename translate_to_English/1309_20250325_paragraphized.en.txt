<think> Well, the user gave me a task to help me organize the transcription into paragraph transcription. First, I have to look at the user's requirements carefully. The user emphasizes that it can not be deleted, modified or condensed any content, can only adjust the point and line, combined with the theme of the sentence, if necessary add some connection symbols, such as commas, sentences, but can not add new content.

First, check if there is a speaker, but here it is not like, just a sentence repeating. So, I just need to consolidate these sentences into paragraphs, each paragraph 3–6 sentences, separated by an empty line. But because the content is exactly the same, the merging method may need to consolidate multiple sentences into one paragraph, or to split into several paragraphs, each containing multiple sentences. However, according to the rules, there is no need to concatenate sentences in the same paragraph, so I need to concatenate them with a comma or a comma, but since each sentence is the same sentence, it may need to be separated by a period, and then an empty line.

So, I can sort it into a paragraph, which contains multiple sentences, separated by a period, and then separated by an empty line. Or, according to the rules, 3–6 sentences per paragraph, so I can combine every 3–6 sentences into a paragraph, separated by an empty line. For example, the first three sentences are combined into the first paragraph, and the next three sentences are combined into the second paragraph, and so on.

For example: Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please do not like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots..

For example: Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots.

Please like, subscribe, forward, and appreciate the support of mirrors and dots. This is done until all sentences are finished. There may be many paragraphs to do so, as a total of about 2070 seconds each sentence may need to be divided into multiple paragraphs, each paragraph 3–6. This will be more consistent with the rules and avoid paragraphs being too long.

In addition, it is important to use the Chinese all-in-one punctuation point to fill the appropriate punctuation point at the end of the sentence. Because each sentence is a separate sentence, it should end with a sentence. To sum up, I need to organize these repeated sentences into multiple paragraphs, each paragraph contains 3–6 sentences, separated by empty lines, and ends with a sentence.
