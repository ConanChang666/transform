All lines.

I would like to expect the benefits of the two new factories in Kaohsiung, Thailand to be gradually fermented in 2026-027. I would also like to introduce this to you. This is the time we hire.

I want to be simple. He has a wealth of experience in this academic and industry in the past. It helps companies to accelerate their development in five areas. It includes smart manufacturing industrial engineering. It includes smart manufacturing industrial engineering.

AI empowers the link between the semiconductor industry. And the research section of the industry collaboration. I think that the operating team will be the chairman of the group. That is, the Group Chief Strategy Officer. Then do a whole strategy layout. The general manager is driving digital transformation and empowerment.

That part of the operator is responsible for the whole management and execution. So I think that the three of us should be an iron triangular. The industry should not be so complete as a part of the iron triangular. The purpose is to improve the overall operational efficiency and accelerate.

I think he was born in 1966. Tsinghua University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. He is the public department of Tsinghua University. I was then a doctor of sushi in the industrial engineering of Hon Shun. He has been in the industrial engineering of Tsinghua University since he returned to Taiwan in 96 years. Professor.

Then he went to the head of the department, this president. It was always at Tsinghua University. But the middle is also in charge. TSMC's consultant at TSMC in 3 years.

Delta's consultant is still in the spotlight. Most importantly, he was in 2005 to 08. He was the deputy director of TSMC's industrial engineering department. I think this is his experience in a so-called industry.

He also served as a Convener for an industrial engineering and management department of the Ministry of Science and Technology. That was in 2020. We were able to assist the company with this acquisition. One of the so-called ones just mentioned a few directions.

That was when I was an executive vice president at Tsinghua University in 2022. He left with the vice president until the end of February. I thought he was good at big tree bases. Semiconductor manufacturing is smart. Digital Conclusions or Blue Lake Strategy Industry 3. 0. I have a lot of experience in this industry.

It's easy to share his background with everyone. It's good to come back. That's what I think the revenue performance is just talking about. I think we're all higher than the industry average. That's been the eighth year in a joint. One of the world's number one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, a PCB.

Well, let's go back to that. I think that's what I see from this data. Although the 2023 decline of 15% of the entire PCB was based on BRIST MARK. The 2024 share grew by about 5%.

That's what I think. We've grown so much higher than the industry average so far. OK. That's what I think I've been up to in the past. It's a strategic development strategy that I've seen before.

That's why some of them aren't doing very well. We've been in so-called coworker theory all the time preparing it for a better place to do well. We've been in so-called coworker theory all the time preparing it for a better place to do well.

So the AI part of the management side will be put into one of the applications at the front. So the part of the camp I want to camp is well aware of the AI server. A server or high-speed computing memory that runs at the edge. The part of the tube is that light communication is also a part of switching between the base station.

The AI VR shadow holder. Then it is related to the car. So I think it is especially large. For us it is a lot or a part of the end. So why just talk about it. That's why you see that in 2023 we actually applied AI products to 8% of our products.

Last year we reached 45%. That year we would have about 90 percent or more of our share. It also means that we have the entire strategic layout. It just keeps up with the trend of the times. I think of Thailand. I just talked about Thailand in particular.

That's what I think about our first eight-frame project in Thailand. It started to be installed in February. Now how to install it yourself.

At the same time, we also carry out the second phase of the project. This is also ground-breaking production. That is the main one. In the first phase, we are mainly in the related parts of the high-end server car light-throughness application. Of course, we provide a high-end product called RPCB HDI.

This AI extension in Kaohsiung is an important R&D and technical production base for real AI market demand. Focus on providing high-end products. There is the IC carrier transparency section. I think this has already been announced.

I don't think the long room is covered in your long room. It's a production plant with an advanced Flexible BGA before the build process. It's high-density and high-density. Take a look at HDI's PCB. I'd also like to announce that we're ready to invest $2 billion to buy equipment.

Building capacity is how it is at the moment. Of course, the part of the soft plate is already in the market stage. That I want to strengthen the capacity level of the world. Providing customer needs. The pursuit of steady growth.

So this year's capital expenditure part. Of course, this year's capital expenditure is a little bit less. But I think it should be a lot of investment. That year's figure will be higher than this. Because I just want to go from Kaohsiung's department level.

Or Thailand's department level. That's the part I want overseas. The high-end productivity plan for market applications. I think it's the way to go for sustainable development.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will identify the speaking section of each speaker and combine the sequential sentences of the same speaker into paragraphs. For example, the first speaker starts from [950. 76-955. 76] and until [969. 76], these sentences should be combined into a paragraph. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic, but the insertion of other speakers in the middle requires proper segmentation.

In the process, it is necessary to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp, to ensure that each sentence is correct, no omissions or wrong positions. At the same time, the user mentioned "do not delete any sentences" is the key, and must ensure that all sentences are included, even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to some oral expressions, such as "good thank you", "good", "good again", etc., that these should remain as they did during the conversion without any modification. At the same time, check if there are any punctuation or formatting problems, such as the Chinese term, commas are used correctly, and the timestamp is correctly aligned.

In summary, the process needs to be meticulously processed, maintaining the integrity and order of the original content, and at the same time reasonable segmentation, so that the final paragraph typed transcription is both in line with the requirements of the user, and is easy to read and understand.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

In the future, we will drive the digital transformation of the company, and the semiconductor industry chain, divided from the inside and out. On the operational side, the entire digital transformation, including the company's digital transformation committee, including its digital transformation center, which includes solutions for smart manufacturing, AI CIM, and then industrial engineering, etc., and then through the development of technology to achieve a purpose of empowerment. On the other hand, the whole industry chain is to let the company target our customers, including customers from the AI, including customers from the semiconductor industry chain.

In the past, I will use some of the relationships I have in the industry as a series of industrial chain. In addition, outside in also through the company's significant ESG, by working with universities and universities across the mainland of Taiwan to conduct research on industry-academia cooperation, on the one hand, and on the other hand, to introduce advanced talents. The whole company in the process of upgrading and transformation, will also actively look for high-level talents from the outside, and will do a selection and cultivation of internal and external talents, and turn this inner and external integration into a sustainable cycle.

On the other hand, the whole company is promoting smart manufacturing, in fact, to achieve sustainable production or the circular economy, especially in the past, the company has in the past to reduce energy consumption, and the progress of industrial manufacturing centers in the past, as well as the recycling of this raw material, has a good performance, and is reflected in the affirmation of the various units mentioned by the chairman. Next page. The company has 29 factories, which include nine new factories have been introduced in the beginning of smart manufacturing, six upgrades of the old factory, and 14 factories in the future, including four factories that have just been mentioned in Kaohsiung and Thailand, one we are in the upgrade, and nine old factories will continue to upgrade.

Thank you for the brief introduction. Next, we asked our Director and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Li, to introduce the operation planning and execution of the company. Thank you. We are going to go to the next page. Then, I will report a brief overview of some of the operations. First of all, I would like to continue to see the growth in the revenue of the server car and light communication in 2025.

I think that by continuing to expand the key development with customers in Intel AMD and ASIC architectures, and with the planning of existing two cloud customer-related product development, I will play a complete PCB solution, and accelerate the global production layout, which I just want to include Thailand and other parts of the production base of Kaohsiung. In light communication, I also want to seize the market with high-end products. Optical communication products last year also reported to you, through the customer's certification, it has entered mass production, the overall revenue control line will be gradually improved, mainly this year with 800G and 1.T high-end MEP design, which will add more customers and orders, especially with Thailand manufacturers, and more part of this part of the development phase of the design phase of the development phase of the development phase of the development phase of the AI.

I think the part of the IC carrier board in 2024 is a year of harvest, the revenue of the IC carrier board in 2024 is 75. 6%, the growth rate is higher than the average of the industry, I think our strategy in the IC carrier board has always been to take a stable design, stable quality stability in the technical breakthrough, thank you, but now, I want to add the carrier board three times, then I want to join the future is actually the carrier board four, then I am currently in the IC carrier plate capacity is based on high-end products, which ABF benefited from CHIPLED.



The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription of re-routing: In combination with our ongoing investment, I would like to increase the depreciation and research and development. Because the whole of our new campus, including the investment in the capacity of the newly talked mainland, as well as the area of Kaohsiung AI and Thailand, these parts will continue to join. So in general, such as the newly mentioned soft boards have the price of raw materials and the new capital, but overall, I think that the chairman of each product line will also talk about our entire product line will be better than last year, and each product line also uses digital transformation, we continue to have some breakthroughs, so the goal is still able to maintain the level of 2024.

At the same time, from the customer's point of contact, what are the initial needs and growth potential of these new capacity, I want to play the most regional benefits for the division of several parks, I think this is our purpose, I think recently for these planning customers are very supportive, we such a distribution, I think China for China's large number of mature products and some automotive products, the largest market and manufacturing place, that for Taiwan, we focus on some super high-end products, hard copy part is about some 36 to 80 layers, the customer cooperation of high-end technology innovation incubation site, not only focus on the whole lot of production, that focus on new technology research and mature and development of the whole development of the entire development of the whole area of Thailand with the whole park, the OOC demand is a large number of demand of OOC, that is the mature process mature products, basically under such a strategy, we continue to carry with the relevant customers with such strategies. The next question is how much the company involved in the demand for ASIC growth, and what other opportunities to ask about the current US-based CSP customer AI ASIC related products, such as why the development of UBB board and NVIDIA board is the difference, I think that I came to a brief report carrier board development has been our development point, so we also mastered the large domestic and foreign ASIC customers, and there have been some significant growth in the past years, so with the continuous product certification of the mass production of the product will be more and more, so I want to add to the customer's demand for out of China, that in the part of the hard panel has removed two cloud ASIC cases other than the PCB business of the AI platform I want to have also participated in, and then the two cloud customers have accelerated the development of AI ASIC related products, which we have provided with the customer strategy to provide a complete solution for the development of PCB and the global production layout, especially the intelligent factory in this year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided verbatim fragments every timestamp and the corresponding sentence. The user has divided the original content into multiple timestamps and sentences, my task is to reorganize these sentences into consecutive paragraphs while keeping the original order and content.

During the processing process, you may encounter connection problems between some sentences, such as some sentences that may belong to the same topic or the same question, and need to combine them into a naturally smooth paragraph. For example, on the part of industry growth in 2024 and 2025, it may be necessary to combine relevant timestamps and sentences together to form a complete answer paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any sentence", so it is necessary to ensure that all sentences are included even if some sentences look duplicate or redundant.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to whether the format of the timestamp is correct, to ensure that the position of the timestamp in the paragraph after the conversion is reasonable and does not affect reading. It may be necessary to put the timestamp at the beginning of each sentence, or in the appropriate position in the paragraph, but the timestamp in the user's example is usually placed at the beginning of each sentence, so I will follow this format.

I would like to explain that in 2024 the whole industry, although we just, we have more than 70% growth. The overall industry, regardless of the ABF and BT, its market is not bad. In 2025, I would like to have a slight growth, the overall growth of ABF will be higher than BT because of the use of AI. The whole of our company in the carrier business, because of our past efforts, we in the BT and ABF intelligent factory, we are high quality, all of our customers as long as they come to our factory, we are very agree with our past efforts in this regard.

So, with the high quality and high efficiency, the growth rate of our carrier plate in 2025 is higher than that of the industry. I think that the main semiconductor customers are located in Europe and Asia, and that in response to such needs, we are in addition to the original Qinhua Island BT and Shenzhen ABF factory, we are just talking about the establishment of the Kaohsiung Future BGA factory.

In the next question, what is the potential impact of Trump2.0 on the rise of tariffs and technology control measures? Is there a requirement for customers to absorb tariff costs? In addition, under the US tariff policy, do you consider investing in other areas besides Thailand and Kaohsiung? This part I want to answer. I think the company keeps focusing on the changes in international trade policy, and I think this is something that needs to be done in management.

The second point is about the change of tariffs, I think, so far, is not really mini, but we have maintained a transparent communication with our customers and negotiated reasonable cost-sharing mechanisms based on long-term cooperation, while maintaining our competitiveness through self-innovation and automation enhancement. The company has long invested in advanced technology research and development and established a multi-supplier system with international equipment material suppliers, and I want to ensure that the product roadmap is not affected by the effective response to the challenges of technical control.

That's all the questions we've received before the conference. Then we're going to open online for you to ask questions. And remember, if you have any questions, you can enter your question in the chat room after the chat, and now we're going to answer this online question. The first question is about the product, what is the difference between the softpad of the folding machine, the HDI, and the general mobile phone?

I think the folding machine because it needs to fold the sticker, so the special material on the soft board is not the same as the general non-folder, the past we really wanted to be a leading manufacturer for the entire folding machine, so now no matter what, some of the mainstream folding machines in the market now I think we are the main supplier. The whole hard board part because of foldable sticker, it needs to be thin, its whole design in that light and small part of that, so it is also linked to the high-end HDI related technology, because in the past because of the technology related to the board, there are some of the leading advantages of these folding-related products, and there are some of the above.

The next investor's question is the equipment put into Kaohsiung AI Park, when is it expected to start production? This part I do explain, the whole of Kaohsiung AI Park, there are three product lines, the soft board part we have entered a stage of the whole trial production, then again, the carrier board part of the equipment has been in the Q3 the whole installation, then we expect to have some trial production at the end of Q4 to the end of the year, the hard board part is also about a month to follow the board time is about a month, so now a few product lines are going to be as fire, so the overall operating performance will be 2026 to 2027.

I think the operating expenses are the same. This should be very close to the proportion of our revenue, which means that my revenue growth is about the same as about the proportion. Thank you to the Chairman for the answer. The next investor asked the question is what is the depreciation of 4Q24? What is the main reason for the decline of Gross Profit Margin? This part is the depreciation fee.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-phrase transcript: [2753. 92-754. 44] 4Q [2755. 72-757. 76] 4Q depreciation fee declines. [2759. 04-2763. 66] There is another reason why the Gross Profit Margin ring declines. [2765. 96-2771. 60] The depreciation of the 4Q section is because of our equipment. [2771. 90-2774. 72] The timetable is different. [2775. 22-777. 28] So the new equipment is new at the time of 4Q.

[2777. 52-2780. 86] The depreciation mentioned here is the depreciation of the equipment that has been mentioned. [2781. 12-2785. 20] There is no difference in the 4Q statement. [2785. 46-2788. 02] The Gross Profit part of the statement. [2791. 10-2793. 14] The Gross Profit statement is because of us. [2793. 66-2796. 48] Basically speaking, it is the fourth quarter of last year. [2796. 72-2797. 76] The entire revenue statement.

[2798. 00-2799. 28] Very high. [2799. 54-2801. 60] So the entire revenue portion. [2801. 90-2803. 18] is an economic pair benefit. [2803. 44-2807. 28] The fourth quarter of the year was a little bit more relatively. [2807 52-2811. 12] Slow down a little bit, so this part has some effect. [2811. 36-2813. 92] The rest of the statement is actually a comparison.

[2814. 18-2815. 20] Very little change. [2817. 76-2820. 32] Less than a trip. [2820. 58-2822. 12] Junior grade. [2824. 68-2826. 22] Thank you for the explanation of Mr. Tsai. [2826. 48-2815. 78] We made the next online investor question. [2829. 80-2831. 34] I would like to ask some questions.

[2831. 90-2833. 44] Currently in the mobile phone market problems. [2833. 94-2835. 48] Because of the channel. [2836. 00-2837. 28] The results of the visit. [2837. 52-2841. 62] It appears that a large mobile phone manufacturer is expected. [2841. 88-2842. 40] [2842. 90-2844. 18] 3Q26 [2844. 70-2845. 98] Entered the folding machine market.

[2846. 48-2848. 02] Currently from the assembly plant. [2848. 54-2850. 58] Samsung panel as well. [2850. 84-2853. 66] The related mature manufacturers know from there. [2853. 92-2855. 96] Progress as if it were on fire. [2856. 48-2859. 04] And the probability is at 3Q26. [2859. 54-2851. 08] The new folding machine is released.

[2861. 08-2863. 12] Looking for this part of the company. [2863. 64-2864. 40] Soft and hard board. [2864. 66-2865. 68] What is ready. [2866. 20-2869. 52] What is the status of the current delivery to the customer test. [2869. 78-2871. 58] Expected to expand. [2872. 60-2878. 74] I want to make it difficult to assess a situation for a single customer.

[2879. 00-2881. 04] But it was just reported. [2881. 30-2886. 42] We are folding in terms of the technical aspects of the soft board. [2886 68-2889. 50] Some of the preferred customers are related. [2889. 76-2891. 04] Technical research and development related. [2891. 34-2893. 64] Some sampling we will certainly be involved in these activities. [2893. 90-2896. 46]

[2898. 76-2901. 30] Thank you for the explanation of the Chief Operating Officer. [2901. 32903. 12] The next on-site investor question is [2903. 36-2905. 68] Ask the company's management team. [2905. 92-2909. 76] The company's revenue growth in the past year was better than average. [2910. 02-2911. 56] That year 2025. [2911. 82-2913. 36] Annual revenue growth.

[2913. 60-2915. 66] Is there a chance to exceed double digits. [2917. 70-2918. 98] This part of my answer. [2919. 24-2921. 04] I think we are presently. [2921. 34-2922. 62] Should compare. [2923. 12-2926. 96] The growth rate of a PRISMA announcement will be higher. [2927. 22-2931. 58] Can we not exceed double digits at this time, but it must be above this number.

[2932. 08-2935. 16] Because this whole change is quite large. [2936. 44-2941. 30] I can briefly report that you can see the December we last year. [2941. 56-2945. 66] December and this year we YY actually 19 to 20%. [2945. 92-2948. 98] We follow the whole Tempo process. [2949. 24-2950. 78] I see the market environment. [295.1 34-2952. 10]

[2955. 44-2975. 22] Our goal is to do so. [2960. 80-2963. 62] Thanks to the Chairman's and Chief Operating Officer's answer. [2964. 14-2966. 18] The next investor asked is [2966. 70-2969. 00] Please ask the U.S. Department of Microchips. [2969. 52-2971. 82] If TPU is adopted. [2972. 32-2974. 12]

[2974. 64-2975. 14] How. [2975. 40-2978. 22] I'm here. [2981. 08-2982. 88] Is a simple answer I want to do. [2983. 38-2985. 94] Major customers of the US series if the whole TPU part is used in AI cell phone chips. [2992. 60-2998. 74] I want the demand for new types of PCBs in business because there are some different PCB designs.

[2999. 26-3001. 56] For example, high-frequency high-speed signal. [3001. 82-3005. 66] and higher power consumption management of some leads to the customer right. [3005. 92-3008. 72] HDI SLP or ABF is higher. [3008. 98-3010. 52] A requirement for specifications. [3010. 52-3012. 56] This is a technical level meeting. [3012. 82-3016. 92] will also accelerate some of the AI-related applications.

[3017. 18-3018. 96] The AI related application of the H end. [3019. 22-3023. 32] If the application of the AI mobile phone will also drive the AI chip. [3023. 58-3027. 16] And some synchronization development of related products will also be the same. [3027. 42-3031. 26] The increase in the AI related layout in this regard. [3032. 02-3032. 80] So, the overall part of [3033. 04-3036. 38] I think that's good for the PCB.

[3036. 88-3038. 16] That's the whole point. [3038. 68-3040. 48] Turns to all new business opportunities. [3040. 78-3041. 80] I think we're also positive. [3042. 06-3045. 12] A trend in AI-related chip packages. [3045. 38-3048. 72] That raises our high-end PCB production line. [3048. 96-3051. 02] For example, the current BT line.

[3051. 28-3055. 88] Or ABF line or SLP to take control of this wave. [3056. 14-3057. 42] The opportunity for the whole change. [3058. 44-3058. 96] Thank you. [3062. 02-3063. 56] Thanks to the Chief Operating Officer for the explanation. [3064. 32-3065. 86] The next investor asked if the company shipped to NETSwitch. [3066. 12-3069. 44]

[3070. 52-3071. 04] or Yes. [3071. 28-3072. 32] Is it possible to explain. [3073. 08-3077. 94] The specification of the current product and the direction of future development and the progress of shipping. [3079. 22-3082. 04] This I have also explained. [3082. 30-3087. 42] I think we already have the ability of the entire switch network. [3087. 68-3088. 70] So why.

[3088. 96-3094. 32] In addition to our existing factories, we are building from 36 levels of AI center in Kaohsiung. [3094. 58-3099. 20] To the highest level or even to a technical capacity of 80 levels of panels to become. [3099. 44-3100. 22] We are the future. [3100. 52-3104. 36] To become a focus of the collaboration of high-end switch customers. [3104. 88-3107. 44] So we are now working with the cloud for the pre-engaged. [3107. 94-3109. 22] In addition.

[3109. 48-3111. 78] Outside of Kaohsiung, I want to Thailand. [3112. 04-3114. 34] There is the existing factory. [3114. 60-3118. 44] There are some higher cooperation part of this part because. [3118. 70-3121. 26] His technology is just talking about high-resurrect. [3121. 76-3112. 12] To high-resurrect to HDI to optic module I want this product line.
