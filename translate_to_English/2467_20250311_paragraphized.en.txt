We are very excited to be part of the first Cathay Center adult forum. We also use G2C as an opening. Let you know about G2C, and I will continue to talk about the concept and value of the G2C Alliance.

The way the whole league is played is important. The way the league will be strong enough to face the next things overseas. It is also an extension of the country. We are also two consecutive years. From 2023 to 2024. Get five Supply Chain industries from G.

We shared it with a lot of friends in 2024. It was the only Taiwan-based equipment manufacturer to receive a mass production resource award in 2023. We also received an economic award last year for it. That's how we started investing in SOIC technology.

The G2C, like 2020, has been around for almost five years now. Then there are many changes. And many cultures, one of which is the integration of the culture and culture of each other.

This is also a collaboration with this project over the past five years. It strengthens some of the interaction between R&D personnel. Especially last year, it started as a military. A part of the R&D personnel in the Supply industry. A part of the R&D personnel migrated to Zhixian and Military Law. The whole team has passed.

That's how it accelerates the development of the other two devices in a long time. It's a big change, of course, and of course, we've seen people for years. In fact, there are a lot of forums outside the country.

We have some adjustments to the internal work. In the future, we will use some such as business or way. To attract external talents into the experience team. So I think it is possible to go into 2020. Seeing a portion of the cost will be reflected here. The cost of the bonus will be reflected here.

Of course, 2025. We also think that this should help. Because we want high-quality engineering capabilities change is a necessary direction to develop. This is also the direction for Lan Chi Wan Science and Technology Engineering to launch our G2C in 23 years.

So you can see our Blue Chi Yunke project. Now there are more than 1500. Especially two or more less than 500. This trend will not change. This is also a big expectation for all industrial companies currently shipping to Phu Quoc Mount. But we also found that a lot of people are moving to Phu Quoc Mount very quickly.

That's what we're having trouble with. That's what keeps us at least overall. In fact, at least we're naval or maintaining our basic thinking, as always. That's where we focus our core technology. We're caught first in that field by our core technology. That's what we're most important about.

At least, it's the core of stress-thinking technology. Of course, there are also a number of complexities such as INVIPLASMA technology that are our basic technology. Military is a reduction of stunts. Especially for the past two years, it has made some new refinements in the parts of stunts and stunts.

Our top-of-the-line measurement also incorporates the technology of military testing into our own equipment technology. It is integrated into our own equipment technology. It can be integrated from who can do the work of others. It is also a 100% conductor equipment provider. It is also based on BIG AND PLACE, Diamonder and TripSolid. It is also a comparison of our entire terrestrial alliance.

We're in the category of military. Of course, managing is now the top vice president and chief executive officer of military precision. This year, it's the role of day-to-day CEO. In military precision, he's the chief executive and chief executive officer.

First of all, I made a simple introduction. That's when we were in 2022. We were in 2023 and 24 years. We all got the GSNC award. So I got to see it myself. At present, it seems that there are no Taiwanese equipment manufacturers at the same time better than him.

It is not for us to do so; it is for the benefit of those who do it, and it is for the benefit of those who do it; it is for the benefit of those who do it; it is for the benefit of those who do it, and it is for the benefit of those who do it.

It is also hoped that the stable payment will be made. The resistors and the management team can be more confident in making decisions. More bold to make decisions. We are now ready to enter the 60th year of the company's development. In fact, in fact, the military, military and military companies. The completion of the development is almost 150 years.

So we have a role in the equipment industry in Taiwan. In fact, we get a lot of trust from our customers. Because only the right name gets a lot of trust. That's now from the operator without asking him. Frank is taking over in 2022. He also has a few top-level shifts.

I am going to share with you a few sessions today. One is how to interview the state of Macau until February 2025. The second is that we see a PCB industry.

Or, "What is the matter with you that you do not see, and what is the matter with you, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see, that you do not see."

Then I saw the expansion of the All-State that started last year. Subtree's expansion. Then there continued to be a network test audience. This is what we saw. What our role is. This is also shared with you.

There is ESG. Last year we weren't really able to talk about ESG. But after 2024, we did a lot of shifts. Then we also worked with our clients.

We all have some ESG expectations. It's the whole product. It's a big announcement until February. It's a lot of investment friends in general, I'm just waiting. We see YY for sure.

That's until 2025. The YY is accumulated until February. 26% of the year it was 24 years ago. It's relative to 2023 cumulative information. I'll share it with you.

The change in gross profit margin. Then there is a change in the ratio of the business. Share with you. The first is our year-end draw. From 19 to 24 years. What we can see is 24 years.

The bottom orange is. Semiconductors have a capacity of 35% at the time of 24 years. Then in 3 years. Semiconductors have increased by 17%. Then in 2 years.

It accounts for about 11%. 10 to 15%. So you can see. The transformation of the entire product industry group. And look at the light yellow above. The light white is the DISPLAY industry.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph transcript: A 40 cosmic species is an industry that is experiencing a dramatic change. This change is also reflected in our industry. We are interested in understanding the impact of this change. In fact, over the years we have steadily developed into the semiconductor sector.

We believe that this year, there will be some changes in this area, and unfortunately, many of our customers' capital expenditure status does not match us. In fact, the status of these customers is constantly growing. In terms of gross profit margin, we can also share it with you. For three years, a lot of friends will ask us why the gross profit margin will be similar to that of 23 years, about 41%.

The second reason is that when we saw the customer began to have the ability to take away the advanced packaging equipment significantly. Therefore, when we started to recognize all the losses, so in the third quarter of 2023, gross profit margin went back to 46%. I think it was a big change.

The first reason is that we have some newly developed models this year. It is usually set a installation fee. Although it has not happened, we will pre-arrange a dedicated fee for a series of installation machines. So, a pre-arranged fee will occur in 24 years. The second reason is because the PCB industry.

In 2023, the PCB industry has a very high proportion. However, this year, the proportion of PCB industry may be lower. Therefore, this change will turn the gross profit margin into a full average. This year, it should be normal to look at this. Last year, the general manager shared with all investors, Zhisheng will not only look at the hair style, one thing we look at is AI.

Of course, we also saw the PCB industry inside the AI Supply Chain, in fact, has been changing the process, there is a lot of changes to the Lenovo, Live Space has transformed. That is, the obvious trend. So, starting from the end of the second quarter last year, we started teaching many of the process improvement capital system equipment to Taiwan, including China, Thailand as well.

This is the reason why we are so much more than happy to have our customers. However, when they get a good order, he begins to spend the entire amount of money on these equipment manufacturers. So, like this year, we have been dealing with the problems of suppliers in China, so I feel that in the PCB industry, not because we are in the AI field of PCB, so our evolution is like this.

Of course, in the field of non-AI applications, the price is really high. But last year we began to discuss with us that the status of the hundreds we see is gradually increasing. But still, we are more centralized, compared to the customers in the upward.

Finally, starting in 2023, we see the development of the core AI technology construction of Face1, such as the current capital expenditure of the CSP plant is in the first stage of the AI infrastructure. But from DipSeq, it has changed a lot, and we see this phenomenon ourselves, and we are discussing new specifications with our customers in the market.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there is a duplicate or need to pay special attention. For example, the user mentions that there is a duplicate "I will pick up the head" between the timestamp [1019. 00-1024. 00] and [1030. 00-1032. 00], which may be an error or duplicate, but according to the user's request, the content must be kept as it is. Next, I need to sort the corresponding timestamp in order and make it easier to read.

At the same time, be aware of the mixed parts of Chinese and English, such as "Mobile device" and "Sync", which may need to be kept as it is, but make sure the context is smooth. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is arranged in chronological order. For example, after the timestamp [1052. 00-1054. 00] the content is suddenly switched to Chinese, which may be due to speech recognition errors or switching languages, but must be kept as it is.

In addition, some sentences may be inconsequential due to speech recognition errors, such as "because of the VIP public service bill", but according to the user's request, can not modify the content, can only keep the same. Next, I will check whether there is duplicate or redundant content. For example, time stamps [1025. 00-1027. 00] to [1030. 00-1032. 00] duplicated "I will pick up the head" between paragraphs, which may need to be appropriately separated, but all duplicate sentences must be kept. At the same time, pay attention to terms such as "Covas" and "Triplet", to ensure that they appear correctly in the context.

Similarly, discussions about the SYC and Covas platforms need to be segmented to ensure that each topic has a separate paragraph. Finally, I will read through the entire converted paragraph-by-text text, check whether all sentences are properly preserved, no omissions or errors, and divide the paragraphs in a reasonable manner, in line with the requirements of the user. At the same time, make sure that no additional content is added or modified in the original text-by-text text-by-text text-by-text text-by-text text-by-text text-only (completely retain all the original sentences, adjust the paragraph structure): -- when a new order is made, we find that the HDI subscriptions are starting to move.

This new AI application we see, I think, is going to start. Mobile device, we also see that our transportation equipment corresponds to the customer's capital expenditure, some intelligence is in response to this action, we also see this phenomenon, so we can expect this. Then we also see that the application of AI has started to grow, because from the fourth quarter of last year, we have seen some B2B AI applications started to be applied.

This is why we are so happy that we have partnered with Oxane's plant for more than thirty years. So now its SumTrain equipment needs basically with us to do a bit of education in itself. We will try to meet our customers' needs as much as possible this year, especially in this year's LungsubTrain LungsubTrain's current development, there is also another B3 facial process in Posix that I can start to build with you. There is also a relatively stable state of construction, so I hope to further develop this design, so I would like to share with you now that you just talk to us and talk about Super Level SOC in AI. SYC This group of business in SYC is mainly engaged with Oxane's plant. Last year, we shared with a lot of friends that only MIC and RF competition were relatively low-level PLPs. --- This version completely preserves all the original verbatim statements and sequences, adjusts the paragraph structure only according to semantic logic and tone, and marks the context differences between the Chinese and English switches.

We are one of the few companies in Taiwan that specializes in the PLP products with turnkey equipment. Our tools are also ERP-C technology. We are the MTI, for example, InnoLux, which is the dominant of many devices. We are more interested in seeing what the AI chip can be developed with PLP technology, so this year our customers also mentioned that he is going to PLP development. The size of the position has been changed before this year, and this time MTU tells us about the 310 by 310, and the results of the production continue to develop here, this is a situation.

We just talked about the state of the agro-industry, where the Old Set state was just shared, its expansion progress is clear, from the fourth quarter last year we saw a very clear signal that we had to follow him to do this, so we also went to a number of new sites gradually coming out. Because the principle is this, because when I show up in T company, in fact, T company's role, especially Triple Unwavered, our CoreOS cut into two parts, one called Triple Unwavered, and one called Assault Train. The process of Triple Unwavered on this side of the Agro-industry will not change, because MoneyShare, because it is too high, because the two of the problems introduced to the two manufacturers into Triple Unwavered, and basically will not change, unless the new ones such as CoreOS L, CoreOS R or CoreOS Dash models, so we will choose a new process to choose a new technology to follow.

This is the first thing we see on the loading scene is the perversion change, then we see Offset doing another thing, now we see that we have a customer in the highest torque Burlinger, a Burlinger customer in Hsinchu, but now there is another company in the middle of the investment in this technology, we also more than two years ago, we also cooperate with him, this year we also began to certify the currency, we also expect to follow our customers on Burlinger, because if he can get it, our new technology can be applied to this wave of new Burlinger technology, so this is mainly because we are looking at Burlinger's overall Burlinger's testing technology, his compound rate is nearly 9%, so for us is another growth power.

[1722. 76-1723. 78] Our carbon chain. [1723. 78-1725. 32] Carbon exhaustion is done. [1725. 32-1726. 84] We are facing a lot of changes now. By 2025, we need to make a lot of changes. Our goal is to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our carbon emissions.

However, there is still a long way to go. [1728. 12-1728. 90] In. [1728. 90-1731. 72] Advanced sewing equipment carbon paper machines should put this certification. We are actively working in order to achieve our goal. We have received many certifications because our carbon chain work is gradually improving. [1731. 72-1734. 28] This is what we are with our customers.

[1734. 28-1735. 80] Tell us about it. We tell our customers that we are working hard to reduce our carbon emissions and we have made progress. This is very important to our customers because they care about reducing their carbon emissions and environmental impact. [1735. 80-1735. 86] This is a good thing. His added value will increase.

[1737. 86-1739. 90] He will increase my added value. [1739. 90-1740. 68] He will also improve. [1740. 72-1742. 26] The added value of our customers. Our services and products will become more quality and customers will be more satisfied. This is a win-win situation. [1742. 26-1744. 30] It is because of its carbon chain.

[1744. 30-1745. 58] I give him one. [1745. 58-1747. 12] I give him one. [1747. 12-1748. 66] The status of the equipment is also known. Our services and products are customized based on the needs of customers, which makes our customers happy. [1748. 66-1750. 96] I can be more clear about how much I want to reduce.

[1750. 96-1752. 76] This is what we did in 2025. [1752. 76-1753. 78] Our goal is to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our carbon emissions. We are actively working to achieve our goal. [1753. 78-1755. 06] And we follow. [1755. 06-1757. 36] This is what we do with our important customers.

[1775. 36-1759. 92] This is how we declare this. We declare our goals and vision to our important customers. This is the starting point for our trust and cooperation with our customers. [1759. 92-1760. 94] We see something from [1760. 94-1763. 76] Our ESG and sustainable business. We see opportunities from our ESG strategy and sustainable business.

This enables us to innovate and make changes. [1763. 76-1766. 32] We start the year. [1766. 32-1769. 40] There are areas of renewable energy. We enter the renewable energy field and we are working on developing and applying innovative technologies. [1769. 40-1770. 68] is the market of yields. We focus on the market of yields and actively participate in the renewable energy field.
