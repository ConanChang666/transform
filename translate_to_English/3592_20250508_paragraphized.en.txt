Next is.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: [583. 00-587. 00] increased by 1% compared to the 33% of the previous quarter. [587. 00-591. 00] then increased by 5% compared to the same period last year. [591. 00-594. 00] The small and medium size driver IC was 50% this quarter. [594. 00-596. 00] increased by 1% compared to the previous quarter. [596. 00-599. 00] decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year.

[599. 00-601. 00] The public part of that car. [601. 00-603. 00] This quarter was 16%. [603. 00-605. 00] This quarter decreased by 2% compared to the previous quarter. [605. 00-608. 00] The same period last year increased by 3%. [612. 00-614. 00] Then it was a recent important event. [614. 00-616. 00] And operational highlights.

[617. 00-622. 00] First of all, the company. [622. 00-626. 00] obtained the second level of corporate governance evaluation for listing. [626. 00-628. 00] was the first 6% to 60%. [628. 00-633. 00] was the company's two consecutive years of such a rating. [633. 00-636. 00] demonstrated the company in corporate governance projects. [636. 00-638. 00] strengthened its Board functions.

[638. 00-640. 00] Improve information transparency. [640. 00-644. 00] Strengthen stakeholder communication. [642. 00-644. 00] Integrating international norms. [644. 00-646. 00] And deepening the company's sustainable corporate norms. [646. 00-649. 00] And the results of the company's sustainable governance culture. [653. 00-657. 00] This is the message of our recent operational focus.

[657. 00-661. 00] First of all, let's review the operation of the first quarter. [661. 00-661. 00-6664. 00] The total revenue of the first quarter is in the low season. [66. 00-666. 00] The growth of the small group is shown. [666. 00-668. 00] Main bribes are included. [668. 00-671. 00] The Chinese government subsidies consumer products. [671. 00-671. 00] The US tariff policy is uncertain.

[674. 00-675. 00] Uncertain driving. [675. 00-678. 00] Makes the terminal customer to pull the goods in advance. [678. 00-684. 00] The message in the three product lines. [682. 00-684. 00] Large-size drive ICs. [684. 00-686. 00] The revenue was slightly increased. [686. 00-691. 00] The pull of the TV and the computer display was better.

[691. 00-694. 00] The display of laptops is relatively smooth. [694. 00-698. 00] It is in the small and medium size AMOLED driver IC part. [698. 00-701. 00] The smartphone AMOLED driver IC shipment dynamics. [701. 00-703. 00] remains stable. [703. 00-704. 00] Wearable devices. [704. 00-706. 00] Because of the increase in high-end applications.

[706. 00-709. 00] So demand continued to grow. [709. 00-711. 00] That was the public part of the car. [711. 00-713. 00] was affected by nitrogen. [713. 00-715. 00] A slight decrease in revenue. [719. 00-723.0. 00] Then this is the part of our operations in the second quarter. [723. 00-762. 00] First we see the operation in the second quarter.

[726. 00-728. 00] The focus of our operations is as follows. [728. 00-731. 00] The first is the main manufacturer. [731. 00-733. 00] In response to U.S. tariff policies. [734. 00-735. 00] Each differs. [735. 00-736. 00] There are some parts. [736. 00-738. 00] Some vendors will be forwarded.

[738. 00-741. 00] This part of the choice to calm its changes. [741. 00-743. 00] The second point is an increase in the exchange rate. [743. 00-746. 00] May have an impact on the performance of operations. [746. 00-748. 00] The third point is China's subsidies policy. [748. 00-750. 00] It now looks like the effect. [750. 00-752. 00] gradually becomes unclear.

[752. 00-754. 00] That is the fourth point. [754. 00-756. 00] We think the long-term need to be observed. [756. 00-759. 00] Several of the above factors affect the market. [759. 00-763. 00] What is the demand part of the three product lines. [763. 00-765. 00] Large-size drive part of the IC. [765. 00-767. 00] What is the demand for IT?

[767. 00-769. 00] Maintains a small growth. [769. 00-770. 00] The demand for the TV. [770. 00-773. 00] has been reduced by short-term control. [773. 00-776. 00] The M5 driver IC part in the small and medium-sized size. [776. 00-779. 00] The mobile phone's shipment capacity remains under construction. [779. 00-781. 00]

[781. 00-782. 00] Because of the expansion of advanced applications. [782. 00-784. 00] The demand will continue to increase. [784. 00-788. 00] The part of the driver IC of the car is public. [788. 00-791. 00] We see that the dynamics are stable or stable. [791. 00-793. 00] Overall, we expect an increase in demand in the second quarter.

[797. 00-801. 00] But this needs to be observed the impact of the law on revenue. [804. 00-807. 00] This is our presentation today. [807. 00-810. 00] The next step is to enter Q&A time. [810. 00-814. 00] Again, we remind you of the use of text in this law. [814. 00-816. 00] Please invest advanced. [816. 00-818. 00] Take advantage of the function of the chat room.

[818. 00-820. 00] Click on Fubon Global Equity. [820. 00-823. 00] for a direct chat. [823. 00-828. 00] Welcome to ask questions. [825. 00-828. 00] We will first reply to the questions before the meeting. [834. 00-838. 00] The first part is about operation and industry outlook. [838. 00-840. 00] This section will be answered by our Chairman, Mr. Ho Ming.

[840. 00-844. 00] The first part is about revenue outlook. [844. 00-849. 00] The first question was raised by Lukas Liu of KGI. [849. 00-852. 00] The question was about the product for Q2. [852. 00-855. 00] The product line for Q2 included LDDI. [855. 00-858. 00] T-COM PMIC SMDDI [858. 00-589. 00] In-vehicle public control. [859. 00-862. 00]

[862. 00-865. 00] and the second quarter of the terminal applications. [865. 00-868. 00] What are the individual demand trends. [868. 00-870. 00] Please ask the chairman for the answer to that question. [870. 00-874. 00] I would like you to invest in advanced afternoons. [874. 00-878. 00] Just as director Wu also made some explanations for this part. [878. 00-880. 00] I would like to add here.

[880. 00-881. 00] It is the second quarter. [882. 00-887. 00] The short-term will be affected by a few of the following factors. [887. 00-892. 00] The first is the policy of our main customers will respond to U.S. tariffs. [892. 00-89. 00] Then they take a different strategy. [895. 00-898. 00] Some customers take advantage of the pre-stocking. [898. 00-903. 00] Those customers will maintain an attitude towards their changes.

[903. 00-908. 00] The second point is due to the recent appreciation of the Taiwan Dollar. [908. 00-92. 00] will negatively impact our revenues. [912. 00-917. 00] The third point is the policy of China subsidies. [917. 00-921. 00] This gradually decreases the marginal benefits. [921. 00-92. 00] This affects the more important needs of our TV. [926. 00-92. 00] This is the short-term part.

[928. 00-933. 00] In the long run, it is important to look at these factors. [933. 00-938. 00] The demand for the overall market is not a significant impact. [938. 00-940. 00] It is based on the three major manufacturers of our company. [940. 00-941. 00] It is based on the three major manufacturers of our company. [941. 00-94. 00] Take a look at the big product line. [943. 00-945. 00] Large size in the second quarter.

[945. 00-951. 00] We see that the demand for IT should grow. [951. 00-956. 00] That IT is a product that includes our Monitor and Notebook. [956. 00-959. 00] That TV is the case. [959. 00-963. 00] Shortly after, it will be controlled by a panel manufacturer. [963. 00-966. 00] This will decrease. [966. 00-970. 00] The second product line is our ML startup IC.

[970. 00-971. 00] The second product line is our ML class launch IC. [971. 00-975. 00] The ML class launch IC is in this part of the mobile shipment. [975. 00-978. 00] Together we can stay stable. [978. 00-982. 00] The wear is because we are in this part of the high-end application. [982. 00-985. 00] See the increase in customer demand. [985. 00-989. 00] This part we will grow in the second quarter of the shipment.

[989. 00-99. 00] The third is our vehicle control. [992. 00-99. 00] The current situation. [994. 00-999. 00] Together, we can maintain the momentum of a shipment with Q1. [999. 00-1002. 00] Take a look at the demand for the second quarter overall. [1002. 00-1004. 00] In terms of quantity, there will be an increase. [1004. 00-1009. 00] But consider the exchange rate factors.

[1009. 00-1012. 00] may affect this section of revenue. [1012. 00-1013. 00] Above. [1013. 00-1016. 00] Thanks to the chairman's reply. [1016. 00-1018. 00] The second question. [1018. 00-1021. 00] is proposed by Yuanda Antony Lau. [1021. 00-1024. 00] and KGI's Obsidio.

[1024. 00-1026. 00] That Yuanda Antony Lau asked. [1026. 00-1028. 00] Revenue growth performance in 2025. [1028. 00-1031. 00] Was there any improvement compared to the previous. [1031. 00-1036. 00] If there is a major factor, is the mobile phone or what applications are driven by it. [1036. 00-1038. 00] The Obsidio of KGI asked. [1038. 00-1040. 00] The company's growth momentum in 2025.

[1040. 00-1043. 00] Which products or applications are mainly from. [1043. 00-1047. 00] The company's growth in the terminal market in 2025. [1047. 00-1049. 00] Is there any growth rate? [1049. 00-1051. 00] This question please our Chairman's answer. [1051. 00-1052. 00] Okay. [1052. 00-1054. 00] If you see the shipment.

[1054. 00-1057. 00] In 2025, we have a variety of products. [1057. 00-1060. 00] Now there should be an opportunity for growth on shipments. [1060. 00-1063. 00] But still. [1063. 00-1066. 00] The overall average unit price is still a downward trend. [1066. 00-1068. 00] If combined with a change in exchange rates. [1068. 00-1072. 00] This section is a challenge for revenue that will constitute a certain growth.

[1072. 00-1075. 00] It is related to the mid-market aspect. [1075. 00-1080. 00] Because the recent tariffs are uncertain of this effect. [1080. 00-1083. 00] may be amended. [1083. 00-1087. 00] It is the main hope that through the second quarter is one. [1087. 00-1092. 00] Actual delivery situation to observe a change throughout the year. [1092. 00-1093. 00] Above.

[1093. 00-1095. 00] Thank you for your response.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcriptions and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format of the verb-provided format to a more coherent paragraph format.

Each question and answer is separated by timestamps, but the user wants to organize these contents into paragraphs while retaining all the original sentences. Next, I need to determine how to combine these timestamps and sentences into a natural paragraph. Usually, the questions and answers in the meeting record have a distinct separation, such as the questioner's name and question, and then the answer.

For example, the first question was proposed by Lucas Liu of KGY, about the impact of U.S. semiconductor tariffs on the company. The following is the question of selling Justin Chen of the question, asking the impact of tariffs on the order. The answer after each question is the chairman's answer, the answer may contain multiple sentences that need to be merged into a coherent paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may be continuous on the timestamp, but belong to different questions or answers, so it is not possible to merge them. For example, the "other" of the timestamp [1123. 00-1124. 00-1124. 00], "the sold Justin Chen of the question may be a continuation of the previous question," and [1124. 00-1126. 00] "the "the sold Justin Chen of the question" is the beginning of another question.

During the processing process, I check every sentence to make sure that each sentence is correctly classified into the corresponding question or answer. At the same time, keep the order of timestamps, but users may not need to keep timestamps in the final paragraph script, so it is necessary to confirm this. Depending on the example provided by the user, they may want to remove timestamps and only retain content, but it is necessary to confirm. However, the example provided by the user, timestamps are retained, but the user may want to remove them.

For example, the timestamp in the original sentence is [1095. 00-1099. 00] The next question is proposed by KGY's Lucas Liu and is converted to "The next question is proposed by KGY's Lucas Liu." Therefore, the user wants to remove the timestamp, only retain the content, and organize the content into paragraphs. Therefore, my task is to remove the timestamp, combine each question and answer sentence into paragraphs, while maintaining the original intention and sequence.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete in syntax, such as "that if U.S. tariffs end to end" followed by "which leads to a decline in mid-term demand", which needs to be ensured that these sentences remain consistent after the merger. Finally, after the conversion is completed, it is necessary to check again whether all the original sentences are correctly contained without omissions or misconsolidation. Make sure that each question and answer structure is clear, with appropriate line breaks between paragraphs, but users may want each question and answer as a separate paragraph, or each answer as a paragraph. Summary step: 1. Remove all time stamps. 2. Combine consecutive sentences into paragraphs, based on the structure of questions and answers.

3. Ensure the integrity of each question and answer correctly identify the beginning of the question and the beginning of the answer. 4. Check the syntax and coherence, adjust the order of the connection words or sentences if necessary. 5. Proofread to ensure that there are no omissions or errors. Now start to process the transcripts provided by the user, and follow the above steps for conversion. The next question is proposed by Lucas Liu of KGY.

That's what the middle of the company represents to the U.S. shipments. In response to tariff uncertainty. Whether there is a change in customer behavior. That is, if the U.S. tariffs end to the end. This leads to a decline in mid-market demand. What impact does it have on the company?

That's it. Justin Chen, who is selling, asked. To find out if your company has any changes to your order due to customs duties. That question asked the chairman to answer. Because our company is shipping to panel vendors. We don't have such a message from our end customers to the U.S.

This quantity of information. That's what I want to say. We care about the company in operation. That's the part of Foundries. This part of working as a foundry. We take a more diverse layout.

We want to reduce the impact of a billion billion. That tariff section. It is necessary to observe that the entire tariff will not be generated. A demand for a global market decreases. The application that our company wants to adopt is to actively expand new customers.

Hope to reduce the impact of the possible decline in terminal demand. We see that there is still a chance for short-term orders to grow. But in the long run, it is necessary to keep an eye on it. Thank you to the Chairman for the answer. The next question was raised by Lucas Shilf of KGI.

That question is about. As customers pull up early in the first half of the year to cope with the uncertainty about tariffs. What do you think about the company's proportion of revenue in the second half of the year? This part of the question asks our Chairman to answer. Our shipments in the first quarter of this year have grown more than in the fourth quarter of last year.

But it is only because there may be a change in the exchange rate issue. So the revenue is less predictable now. At the same time, this part of the second half of the year is still relatively unclear. Thanks to the chairman's answer. The next question was proposed by Lucas Shilf of KGI.

That question is about. There is no initial growth rate idea in 2026. Which product lines will be the main growth momentum. That question asks our chairman to answer. We do not have an estimate of the growth rate at the moment.

We will do our best in three ways. The first is to hope to expand our customer base. We currently have an opportunity for new customers to develop in South Korea, Taiwan. Some of these opportunities will contribute to this year. Some of them will show up in 2026 next year. The second point is that we will work with our customers to develop new applications.

To meet the needs of customers in the future. That's what we want to keep our basic plate. The third is that we want to be able to lay out new technologies. At this stage, we are investing in the display of cholesterol liquid crystals. And the display of Micro LEDs.

That's also going to be gradually enlarged in 2026. But this part is due to the proportion of revenue in the company. The proportion is not very high. So this might not be so much more. Thanks for the chairman's answer. Then there is the question about the price.

This question was asked by Lucas Luce of KGI. The question was whether the company had a product price adjustment. It was mainly what product line. Could the management share with us?

What are the pressures on the price of each product line in the future. What is the future price trend of the products in the market. That question asked the chairman to answer. Well, there is a pressure on each product line to reduce the price. But because of the recent.

There are several costs for several products. The rise is especially on the gold price. So I think our customers also communicate with their customers. Let them understand that there is an upward trend in the entire cost. I hope they can understand. Be able to coordinate with our customers.

The ability to slow down more than one price drop. Thanks to the Chairman's answer. Then there is the question of the small and medium market driver IC. That question was raised by BianDai's Antony Lau. That question was about. What is the situation with mobile phone customers this year?

That question asked the chairman to answer. That AMOLED last year. The penetration was a significant increase. That year the penetration will also increase. But it will be more moderate. Our company.

We are currently able to maintain the original customers. It is also active to develop new customers. We will have a new customer together this year. Add more than this one on our AMOLED mobile phone. Thank you for the chairman's answer.

The next question was raised by Antony Lau of BianDai. The question was about it. This year, the manufacturer of RAMLESS OLEDDI has increased. We have seen that the main customers use RAMLESS substantially. But because of the price of RAMLESS, the price of RAMLESS has declined.

What do you think about SMDDI's business this year? That's the question to ask our Chairman to answer. We currently observe that the customer's reaction to RAMLESS products is quite good. We also see that the customer's adoption ratio is very high in the small and medium market.

That will have an impact on our overall mobile revenue. That's what we hope we can add to the new start. New customers are able to slow this price drop. An impact on overall revenue. At the same time, we at AMOLED are on the wearer side. There's still a chance for growth this year.

In addition, we have an application of AMOLED in IT and tablets. At present, our driver ICs are in mass production. And demand is growing.

At the same time, we are also working on a product development of T-COM. We hope to provide a more complete solution for our customers in the future. Thank you to the Chairman for the answer. Next is a question about large-sized products.

The question is whether the DDI of the PC and TV will see the continuation of the short-term demand. The question is the chairman's answer. Well, that's just already explained. The demand for a TV in the second quarter of the big LCD should be slowing down. There will be an increase in IT.

Thanks for the response from the Chairman. Then there is a question about public buses. The question was raised by Antony Lau, the great source. The question is whether the growth of the Auto Industrial product line this year is expected to be better than 2024.

We expect the growth of this product line to be better than 2024 in the first half of the year. Please ask the Chairman of the Board for the answer. Well, we expect the growth of this product line to be better than 2024 in the first half of the year.

Thank you for your response from the President.

Then there's the financial-related question. That section asks our CFO to answer. That first is the question raised by Antony Lau, the big source. That question is about whether the cost is expected to increase the ratio of two-thirds of the gold manufacturers this year to decrease. That's to further improve the gross profit margin.

The first thing we will answer to this question is that the supply chain partners we work with are important and important suppliers in our supply chain. We will consider the short-chain supply chain and overall resilience when choosing a KPMG OEM partner. We have a long-term stable relationship with supply chain partners. That is, we continue to expand our supply chain cooperation layout with diverse and flexible capabilities.

We will also continue to demand that supply chain partners compete with us in the marketplace. We will also continue to demand that supply chain partners compete with us in the marketplace. In addition, we will continue to increase the development of new products and the economy of product design to reduce the volatility of gross profit margins.

The next question was raised by Yuanda N10RAO. The question was about the violation of the second quarter of this year and the annual fee rate. At the same time, KGI's Lucas Liu asked the company's outlook for the second quarter of the business fee amount or fee rate of the company. The 2025 business fee amount or fee rate of the outlook is different.

Although there is a recent increase in the value of the dollar, we will continue to maintain and control at the recent level. Above. Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer. The next question was raised by Lucas Liu of KGI. The question is about the stock and the trend of the number of days in stock in the second quarter of this year. The stock level of each product line or terminal application is different.

That's why we asked the Chief Financial Officer to answer that. The stock level for the first quarter of this year was 53.4 days later. That was 52.9 days later compared to the quarter. That was similar. The stock level for the second quarter of this year was expected to be a healthy water level.

The relationship between the appreciation of Taiwan dollars will continue to be monitored. Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer. The next question was raised by Lucas Liu of KGI. The question was about the company's estimate of the total tax rate in 2025. That question asked our Chief Financial Officer to answer.

The tax rate section we are now estimates should be similar to the previous year. Well, that's okay. Then there's a question about the progress of product development. Well, that's what we're going to ask our general manager to answer.

That first was the question asked by Lucas Liu of KGI. The company currently has a new product coming soon. And the new product being developed or new market planning can be shared with us.

Because the planning of the product is a relatively mid-to-long-term plan. So we keep up with the changes we have reported in the quarter. We are in the large-sized part. We are continuing to increase our T-Com Driver. There is also a combination of this Total Solution from Pimic. And we have a high refresh rate on this monitor this year.

This includes the high refresh rate of 120Hz and 140Hz. This driver and T-Com for 44Hz products are also in the process of mass production. The AMOLED products are also in the process of wearing the phone.

This is the first time we have created a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, and a new creation.

In addition to the OLED part, we also continue to have a DDIC in the layout car. So we also share with our customers. Together we develop a more customized drive IC. So I want to increase a closeness with our customers.

I would like to add a bit more depth to my client. A degree of close cooperation. That car IC is in addition to the traditional DDI and TDI. Our DDI or TDI IC. We will also integrate this feature with our products.

And that is what the Chairman mentioned. Our cholesterol liquid crystals and Micro LED drive ICs have been massaging at this stage. That is, we are developing a next-generation product. Thank you to the general manager for the answer.

Then there's the question about supply chain. That part is answered by our General Manager. That question is asked by Lucas6 of KGI. The question is about whether companies can share the current headphone and windmill costs prospects. Please answer our General Manager.

We have seen our supply chain partners. There is a trend of downsizing. But because of the recent increase in gold prices, the cost of our windwear has increased. That is also because our product's average unit price. There is a trend that continues to be a downward trend.

That's why the price of gold has an effect on our costs. The degree will increase. Above explanation. Thank you for the general manager's answer. That's all before the meeting.

We will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a question on the site.

The question is about the company's revenue. I want to know how much percentage is denominated in US dollars. I also want to know how much impact it has on the company's profitability by 1%.

That's the question to ask our CFO to answer. Well. The investment is advanced. That is, how much of the company's revenue is denominated in US dollars. And then the proportion of denominated in US dollars is probably more than 90% in US dollars.

The portion of the dollar's appreciation. The part of the dollar's rapid appreciation recently. The gross profit margin in the second quarter should be under pressure. We are now estimated. The gross profit margin of the new currency exchange rate is around 1% per increase. The impact on the overall gross profit margin is about 0.5 percentage points.

But if the exchange rate is stable, there is an expansion cost if it is updated. After that, the expected impact will gradually slow down. Thank you for the Chief Financial Officer's answer. That's because no questions have been asked on site.

We would like to thank you for your interest in investing in advanced technology. That's why the online cooler will end today. The conference briefing will be uploaded on the official website of the observatory and the company. Thank you for your participation. I wish you all the best of luck with your investment.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you all.
