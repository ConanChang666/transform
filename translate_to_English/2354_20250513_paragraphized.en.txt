<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided to see how these verbatim sentences separated by timestamps are reorganized into consecutive paragraphs.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is the speech of a corporate exponential meeting involving company introductions, results of operations, financial performance, sustainability strategies, and Q&A sessions. The speaker frequently mentions the company's core strategy, technical layout, product development, and future prospects. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic, need to be merged into paragraphs, and some may need to be separated, especially when the topic is converted. Next, I need to identify the corresponding sentences for each timestamp and determine the logical relationship between them. For example, the meeting process is followed by the company's operating status and future plans.

The middle part discusses in detail the application of technology, product development, material innovation, etc. Finally, the arrangement of disclaimers and Q&A sessions. During the reorganization process, I need to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are coherent and arranged according to the natural process of speaking. At the same time, all timestamps must be kept, as users may need this information to correspond to the point in time.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to whether the transition between sentences is natural to avoid sudden jumps. There is also a need to check whether there are duplicate or redundant content, but according to the user's request, no sentences can be deleted, so even if there are duplicates, it must be retained. For example, there may be multiple sentences to be merged into a paragraph, but the order and integrity of the original sentence must be maintained.

At the same time, make sure the format is correct, without using any Markdown, only plain text. If there is any uncertainty, further confirmation may be required, but according to the user-provided examples, it should be able to complete the task correctly.

[14. 06-20. 34] There is also our Chief Financial Officer, Li Yenqing. [20. 34-28. 66] And we sit at this last row of lawyers, Mr. Chen Liangyan. [30. 00-31. 36. 36] Thank you. [31. 36-37. 86] The process of our legal process today will first make a brief statement on the company's business results. [37. 86-40. 32] A Q&A exchange was conducted. [40. 32-43. 32] We are now giving our time to the company.

[45. 76-52. 04] Thank you for your interest in investing today. [52. 04-54. 08] Chen just said. [54. 08-57. 60] Next, I will talk to you about the company's overall operating status. [57. 60-59. 98] There are a few prospects to report. [59. 98-65. 48] It contains some of our current more obvious disclosures of developments. [65. 48-66. 94] There is also a development path.

[66. 94-70. 02] That adds some progress in technology. [70. 02-71. 66] There is some development process. [71. 66-74. 06] Some results will be reported here. [74. 06-80. 16] That financial information may have been publicly disclosed before the board passed. [80. 16-83. 36] But some data will be shared with us. [83. 36-87. 50] The final part of Q&A will also be discussed.

[87. 50-88. 98] If any questions. [88. 98-89. 68] Please. [89. 68-91. 68] After our official presentation. [91. 68-94. 68] In Q&A, we will make a formal discussion again. [94. 68-97. 68] The first is to make a disclaimer. [97. 68-100. 68]

[100. 68-102. 68] Some related information may contain predictive information. [102. 68-105. 68] Those operating results are expected to be financially viable. [105. 68-108. 68] There may be some gaps with the actual results. [108. 68-111. 68] The main reason for this is because there are some uncontrollable risks. [111. 68-115. 68] This includes disclosure of financial information is likely to be reviewed or audited by a GP. [115. 68-117. 68] These are for information purposes only.

[117. 68-118. 68] For that detailed information, please visit [119. 68-122. 68] or refer to the full financial report results. [122. 68-124. 68] If there is some outlook, then [124. 68-126. 68] is a reflection of our current view. [126. 68-128. 68] Of course, these views may change in the future. [128. 68-130. 68] Any changes or adjustments are made.

[130. 68-133. 68] Red benchmarks here are not responsible for making timely reminders or updates. [133. 68-134. 68] Please note. [134. 68-135. 68] Okay. [135. 68-140. 68] Today's agenda will first give an overview of the company's current situation and development. [140. 68-142. 68] Next is financial performance. [142. 68-145. 68] Of course we would like to share some sustainability strategies.

[145. 68-147. 68] Last but not least, Q&A time. [147. 68-148. 68] [148. 68-154. 68] We will give an overview of the company's current situation and development. [154. 68-160. 68] The first red quadrant coin is still a core strategy we have previously explained to you. [160. 68-162. 68] Do a practice. [162. 68-166. 68] It is also a technical layout of the four thin and strong strategies.

[166. 68-169. 68] It is linked to some of our clients' projects. [169. 68-173. 68] This is a place where we compare some of the information we've seen before. [173. 68-174. 68] This is a special reminder. [174. 68-178. 68] Our current stage is mainly based on the entire investment. [178. 68-179. 68] Our own equipment. [179. 68-182. 68] This place contains AOI and testing equipment investment.

[182. 68-185. 68] And add some investments in automation and digitization. [185. 68-189. 68] Of course, red benchmarking on human capital is also continuously optimized. [189. 68-191. 68] It contains core technical capabilities. [191. 68-194. 68] And productivity enhancement is our goal. [194. 68-199. 68] In this quarter, we added a new aspect of automation and intelligent services. [199. 68-204. 68] This is mainly a large number of programs for importing automation equipment and efficient operations.

[204. 68-207. 68] Of course, we will provide some robot integration solutions. [207. 68-208. 68] There are some intelligent services solutions. [208. 68-210. 68] We will explain them later. [210. 68-214. 68] The production and manufacturing planning is currently available in China. [214. 68-218. 68] It is also a continuous cooperation with some overseas regions expansion and a supply chain transfer. [218. 68-222. 68] The main purpose of this area is to make a layout according to one of the customer's needs.

[222. 68-227. 68] In general, our core products are the four main cars of Pak Tsing Cold. [227. 68-232. 68] The words of Pak include a mature industry with red benchmarks for our entire metal chassis. [232. 68-234. 68] Some of the techniques continue to be strengthened. [234. 68-236. 68] The words of Pak Tsing are to meet the needs of customers. [236. 68-239. 68] There are some lightweight components of different metal. [239. 68-241. 68] The actions of a key component are a lightweight action.

[241. 68-245. 68] That cold word contains some high-conductive materials that you may be interested in. [245. 68-246. 68] We continue to develop it. [246. 68-253. 68] The strongest word is to do some high-strength aluminum magnesium forming and testing on the strength of each product. [253. 68-256. 68] This application may contain robotic cars and storage products. [256. 68-260. 68] This is a product that is close enough to the face. [260. 68-264. 68]

[264. 68-266. 68] It is on the console and the table. [266. 68-272. 68] We are mainly using some sandwich substrate technology and metal IM technology. [272. 68-275. 68] It increases the overall product components and density. [275. 68-279. 68] It helps our customers to achieve the slimming goal of this game console product. [279. 68-285. 68] Of course, we also have a lot of cooperation in the parts that some customers need. [285. 68-291. 68] The word in the gamepad is based on the integrated molding and 3D magnetic sensing technology.

[291. 68-295. 68] Help customers to enhance the user experience and extend the entire product life. [295. 68-298. 68] Then they can develop a variety of game accessories accordingly. [298. 68-301. 68] First see the left hand side of the word is the sandwich substrate. [301. 68-306. 68] This is mainly a combination of three independent PCBs. [306. 68-309. 68] It increases the total number and density of parts. [309. 68-311. 68] It achieves the goal of thinning the whole product.

[311. 68-316. 68] The metal IM can be seen that we are mainly after placing the metal parts into the mold. [316. 68-319. 68] The second metal injection can be made. [319. 68-323. 68] It can be optimized and then provides the necessary regional strength for strengthening. [323. 68-328. 68] Of course, there is also more development in the shape of freedom. [328. 68-330. 68] And the whole product weight can be reduced. [330. 68-333. 68] On the right, the integrated molding words can be seen.

[333. 68-336. 68] This is mainly about the peripheral products of the game. [336. 68-339. 68] is through this mold forming technique. [339. 68-344. 68] allows the handle of the game to be integrated into a lightweight composition. [344. 68-346. 68] Of course, it is about the user as a whole. [346. 68-349. 68] can experience a better grip texture. [349. 68-351. 68] Finally, the force sensing technology.

[351. 68-352. 68] Everyone knows that our customers are actually our customers. [353. 68-356. 68] This is a special emphasis on interaction here. [356. 68-359. 68] This includes strength sensing or millimeter waves. [359. 68-362. 68] or some of the monitoring devices. [362. 68-366. 68] This is where we continue to develop with our customers on a large scale. [366. 68-368. 68] I believe that the next product is coming.

[368. 68-372. 68] There will also be a lot of red-right here to do a common design. [372. 68-375. 68] And a process of developing or even making it. [375. 68-377. 68] The second point is the heat dissipation module. [377. 68-381. 68] If the heat dissipation module is here, we will continue to use the entire high-conducting hot-pressing material. [381. 68-382. 68] To optimize the material properties. [382. 68-383. 68] There is another one.

[383. 68-385. 68] It enhances the entire cooling capacity. [385. 68-388. 68] It is the way we use this copper powder metallurgy. [388. 68-390. 68] It expands the process application field. [390. 68-394. 68] A key component of the phase change continues to be our goal. [394. 68-398. 68] The current statement, whether in thin heat tubes or uniform heat slices. [398. 68-400. 68] We are all continuing to expand the entire application wattage.

[400. 68-405. 68] The heat exchange efficiency and the development of this widely used field. [405. 68-410. 68] The word hydrogen is only a product at the core of the red line here. [410. 68-412. 68] At present, we are continuing to expand the application area of hydrogen metal. [412. 68-416. 68]

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. A technical improvement in some aspects of lightweight and heat dissipation. This is also a very clear intention of cooperation with customers. There are some products shipped. The middle and right can be seen. This is mainly a more mature product.

At present, the whole metal components are applied to the mechanical parts of the energy-saving system and the automotive components. Currently, there are many well-known manufacturers. It is also a partner of macro precision here. The third point is to extend the technology of combustion of metal. This will be a relatively high gross profit. Then the number of applications is mainly limited.

The high strength, excellent corrosion resistance, the coefficient of this thermal expansion is relatively low, and there is a high thermal conductivity. It is important that we can make real-time adjustments according to the needs of the customer.

In this regard, the whole sports industry and the automotive industry as a partner. If you see on the left side of the screen, the sports industry here is mainly a number of titanium alloy products and material alloy products. It may include the head of the golf club, etc. are the products of our customers that we have matured.

Even the actual shipping orders for electric vehicle batteries are already in hand. Of course, this method will tell you that there is a different place to tell you that the current macro here is to continue to do the whole robot and intelligent product expansion. We will first focus on the whole service robot and human robot manufacturing assembly and the development and supply of key components.

At the same time, we are actively working with some of our global partners to develop the entire European Japan and Asia Pacific markets. The entire robotic components can be seen on the far left. As you may understand most of the costs of our current individual robots or service robots, we talk about Bone Cost or the robotic components and key components.

As you can see, some of our main products include the services of intelligent and intelligent drug bureau smart wards and intelligent care management. Of course, there are some integrated systems and field applications, etc. are currently a key product and service that is more obvious in medical products and intelligent care. Overall, you can report with your investment in the current macro level, or you can use the whole game console products based on the company's thin casing core technology to expand the new business to increase productivity and improve our overall revenue and profitability.

In general, Hong Qiao is the industry with future and potential technologies, such as medical electric vehicles and energy storage products, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the entire global production and supply chain system and comprehensive layout of AI efficient computing robots. And we will give full play to the Group's integration advantages to fight against all our competitors in terms of operational strategies, so I think that because of the recent tariff issues or changes in international political and economic conditions, we are more concerned about some of the relevant operational strategies.

In the future, we will continue to encourage R&D teams to be creative and imaginative, and we have many leading universities and research institutes at home and abroad to develop forward-looking technologies and products.

In the future, we will also be able to implement AI in the production process based on precision manufacturing and cash materials technology. In terms of financial strategy, we will strengthen the management cost optimization structure of finance and cash flow in the future, and enhance the operational performance of the entire enterprise, so that we can be more prepared in the event of an unknown situation.

The current production base has the opportunity to expand around the world, and that has already been done in North America and Japan. Next, we will explain the financial performance of the whole financial performance. In the next quarter, the equity net profit of the company is NT$9.3 billion, which increased by NT$1.04 billion, an annual growth rate of NT$12.22%, and the EPS of the US stock market is NT$0.67. The important data, including our revenue growth rate reached 238.2%, gross profit growth rate of NT$67, and the gross profit growth rate of the trade increased by 37.52%, which is 41.35 times the annual growth rate of net profit, and the revenue of the business is significantly reduced, and the revenue of the external revenue here is 10.98%, but overall, the annual growth rate of the parent fund was 12.22.22%.

In the past quarters, there was a significant improvement in the business interests of the parent company. The balance sheet can be seen that our main focus is the accumulation of shareholders' equity, and in the past quarters, our shareholders' equity can be seen to continue to improve after 2023, and there is an optimisation of the situation. The cash statement is that the cash flow from the business activities, we can see that the cash flow of these quarters is a sign of continuous change in the cash flow of the business activities.

This is our financial information, so of course, we would like to know our overall outlook for the first half of 2025, then we are in the first half of the year as a public view, now in the game console, we simply on the part of the revenue we think is a positive growth situation, then the situation in the same year-to-year situation to improve, the case of the case is also a case of an improvement, that the heat sink module should be the whole year-to-year growth rate should be a smooth, and that other industries and services are also a flat situation.

The first point is to continue to improve the company's self-operation, red benchmark here is to adhere to operational transparency, then we pay particular attention to the rights of shareholders and stakeholders, which we believe is the foundation of the company, which we believe is the whole corporate governance practices to protect the rights of shareholders, treat shareholders equally and strengthen the structure and operation of the board of directors, enhance the transparency of information and implement sustainable development, and assist investors and stakeholders to better understand the effectiveness of our company's governance. The second point is to strengthen the information security, so that in order to pursue the whole July sustainable development, we continue to promote the company's confidentiality integrity and legality of the company, avoid the occurrence of negligence or some deliberate damage, or even natural congestion, which leads to improper use of assets, and affect the company's operations or the rights of the company.

In the future, we will continue to make some more clear progress on the application of recyclable materials in the R&D department. In the future, we will continue to promote the whole Yantai fermentation and Foshan's interests to obtain a whole January 2799 of the waste of industrial purchase of thin gold and gold certification, which is a relatively significant cost achievement. In the future, we will provide a number of cooperation and donation programs for the whole medical institutions and cultural education, etc., and we will provide support in the years to provide social welfare donations, encourage environmental education and support in response to the earthquake, and some major disasters. Thank you for your support.

*** Moderator: ** We are very grateful for the sharing of the silent team, and we will have our Q&A session. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and let me know. I have a few questions. The first one is to ask a spokesperson if the Visio stock was acquired by Walmart last year. Or when do you expect to contribute?

**Spokesperson:** Thank you, thank you. I think Walmart has been an important partner to us since the beginning of 2000. We have also invested in Visio, a company since 2000. It can be reported to us that Visio was listed in the FEOCI, so one of its acquisitions or some of its changes will not be listed in the income statement, but as an addition to shareholders' equity in the entire balance sheet.

In the future, I believe that the quiet team here will use the funds obtained after this acquisition to do some more long-term planning, including investment construction, etc., is a possible direction. Thank you. ** Moderator:** Thank you.

In addition, the recent U.S.-U.S. tariffs and other issues have also been greatly concerned by the market, and we have also invested advancedly to ask if the company has planned to set up a factory in the U.S.? **Spokesperson: ** I want to set up a factory abroad, of course, it is one thing that all investors are very concerned about. In terms of accuracy, I have to say that any investment and plant planning must have to go through a very careful inference and internal discussion, and even coordination with customers here, etc. This may not be something that will be decided in a short time.

Of course, the biggest advantage of the whole distribution group is our ability to integrate the supply chain, which includes vertical and horizontal integration, etc., is what we can do here. In the future, red benchmark will continue to consult with our important customers and communicate with our customers in the future, in line with the needs of our customers, we will consider the possibility of expansion and layout of the entire supply base or the construction base and production base to expand.

**Spokesperson:** There is currently a relative impact on this product in the U.S.A. There is also another area in the dispersed production area, there is another area in the other area, there is another area in the other area, there is another area outside the other area, there is another area outside the other area, there is another area outside the other area, there is another area outside the other area, there is another area outside the other area there is another area outside the other area.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Determined in a few months. Determined in a few months, we need to understand the verification part. Already, after verification, the one that follows the pace of the customer at the time of changing the supplier. Learn about that verification part.

In the direction of verification, we need to consider whether we have a single client or a client of a server. Do we still have investment advanced questions? Investment advanced questions, we need to understand how much Vietnam's capacity is currently mainly what to do and the other thing is that it sounds like some industries say that companies are also investing in a part of Transceiver light module is not possible.

Light module investment, we need to confirm whether the company currently has this business. Well, we do not currently have warehouses in Vietnam, so there is no capacity in Vietnam. Capacity problems. Capacity problems, we need to consider this part of the we have a cooperative partner is the way outsourced will take place. Well, we have several supplier options to schedule capacity. Supplier options.

We have supplier options for several light modules. We have supplier options for several light modules. We have supplier options for several light modules. We have supplier options for several light modules. We have supplier options for several light modules.

We have several supplier options for light modules. Light module suppliers. We need to consider any investment we will make to evaluate the light modules as well as within the scope of our assessment. Then this part is now a more important and more developed product for future development. Product development, we need to consider that we do not exclude such investment as long as we say that it is related to our overall development.

Investment strategy. Investment strategy, we need to think about it and then we will evaluate it in a way that is consistent with our company's strategic direction. There are a few examples of light modules that we can consider at the moment, but we still want to choose them in the most favorable direction for the company.

Investment strategy, we need to consider whether or not this has some synergies or investment interests for Red benchmarking itself. Even some integration effects in OEM or manufacturing, if we have one, we will do a more clear intention here. Investment intentions, we need to consider that all industries, as long as there is a chance to make a profit, will not necessarily make an investment.

Investment strategy. Investment strategy, we need to consider then if there is a formal investment or a more clear message, we will make a different message to make a announcement that it may be a heavy message or the board of directors, etc. We will let you know about the investment advanced thank you. Investment announcement, we need to consider if we still have an investment advanced question to ask.

Expansion plans. To expand the plan, we need to consider whether we might set up our own factory in Vietnam for a long time or just to expand the model with local providers. We need to consider the factory problem, mainly to look at the needs of our customers and the characteristics of the industry, because not every product is suitable for production in Vietnam, because we also need to consider the price of his supply chain as well as raw materials. Supply chain considerations, we need to consider the supply chain consideration.

Production capacity allocation. Capacity allocation, we need to consider the future development direction of the future or look at our overall global economic environment because now there is too much turmoil to say whether or not or not to say good now. Economic environment, we need to consider that this is more important to the customer's needs as our main consideration.

Game console shipping. Game console shipping, we need to think about whether or not the stock will be the same or not. Stockpiles, we need to consider that is the first question is why we want to ask our one marketing one of our marketing for a game console shipping status is a margin is not a relationship with the game console shipping, so a situation of gross profit margin is because I look at last year's gross profit margin is a footprint I don't know whether or not there is a relationship with the game console shipping. Game console gross profit rate, we need to consider the game console portion Q2 and Q3Q2 is a good part of the second half of the year because the current customer's total shipping plan has been affected by the U.S. tariff, so I am not good to say that the second half of the year will be better or better.

The impact of tariffs. We need to consider the impact of tariffs because this may involve talking about the volume of pre-orders in the United States and his actual shipping plan to adjust the gross profit margin. In principle, it is because this time he has increased his bone course in that design, so our revenue will also increase.

We need to think about how the gross profit margin will be adjusted so that the gross profit margin will not be as good as before. The gross profit margin performance is not as good as the gross profit margin because there is a difference in our proportion. The gross profit margin performance, we need to think about the relationship as the game console ships, so the volatility of that gross profit margin will be more affected by the game console. The impact of the game console, we need to think about the special design in the game console is the cooling part, and the case portion is about how much the whole pump is.

Robot design, we need to think about what you say about the different design of the robot is whether it is the structure and cooling design of the product that you want to do with the different manufacturers. Different manufacturers, we need to think about the fact that when looking at a robot with the current mainstream in the market, it is simply that he has the entire shell and his mechanical parts in a different way to do the cooling design. Thermal design, we need to think about the fact that we have contact with some manufacturers in addition to heat dissipation, for example, that he has his unique needs in the entire silence or even the whole weighting, so I think this should be the whole consideration.

As a whole, we need to consider the fact that the entire product is at a very fast pace, then the future is exactly what we are going to see in the market now that some products may be updated in the next few years. Product updates, we need to consider this, then we will follow a research development path for the entire target customer.

The price can be in what range it is. But the customer as a whole, his robot costs or they are here to be unified. If there is a chance, I remember that there are now several robots on the Internet, especially those on the side of the man-made robot is also announced the composition of their Bone Cost, which should be a reference if interested. This may be a temporary situation, because in fact, in the next three to five years, we would like to say that the whole robot here can greatly reduce to a stage of mass production, so I believe that this change is very fast. But in the short term, the public information in the market should be for reference.
