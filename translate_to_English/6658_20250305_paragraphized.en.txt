<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First, I will check the transcription fragments provided, notice the timestamps and the corresponding sentences. For example, from 0.00 to 9.00 are "good", and then there are several similar "good" repeats. Then there are information about the company's incorporation, capital amount, number of employees, etc., and then there are content such as subsidiaries, operations locations, customers, new plant plans, social responsibility, operation status, product strategy, etc. Next, I need to reorganize these phrases separated by timestamps into consecutive paragraphs. The key is to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit, and then combine them.

In the same way, sub-contractor introductions, operation locations, customer information, etc. also need to be segmented. It should be noted that users cannot delete anything, so even if some sentences look duplicated or incomplete, such as multiple "good" at the beginning, they also need to be retained. At the same time, blanks or errors in the timestamp (such as 50. 00-58. 40 "sizing") also need to be retained as they are, and cannot be modified.

Also, pay attention to some possible typographical problems, such as whether the interval between timestamps is correct, whether there are missing sentences. For example, in the user-provided verbatim, some timestamps have a larger interval, such as 59. 00-66. 36 to the later sentences, you need to confirm whether these belong to the same paragraph. Finally, after finishing the initial draft, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural and logical. At the same time, check for formatting errors, such as the punctuation marker is correct, whether the sentence is coherent, to ensure that the user's requirements are fully met.

[9. 00-11. 00] Good. [11. 00-13. 00] Good. [13. 00-15. 00] Good. [15. 00-17. 00] Good. [17. 00-19. 00] Good. [19. 00-21. 00] Good.

[21. 00-23. 00] Good. [23. 00-25. 00] Good. [25. 00-27. 00] Good. [27. 00-29. 00] Good. [29. 00-33. 00] Good. [33. 00-34. 00] Good.

[34. 00-36. 00] Good. [36. 00-37. 00] Good. [37. 00-39. 00] Good. [39. 00-41. 00] Good. [41. 00-44. 00] Good. [44. 00-46. 00] Good.

[46. 00-48. 00] Good. [48. 00-50. 00] Good. [50. 00-58. 40] sizing Testing Technology Intelligent Manufacturing Integration Service Company was founded in May 2020 with a capital of 13.64 billion and the number of employees is about 300. Then in Taiwan, it was set up 3.1%.

The company is located in Taoyuan District of Taoyuan City, Jiangsu Province. It has branch offices in Kunshan, China, as well as public office in Guangdong Province. In response to customer demand, our services follow, so in Huai'an and West Island, as well as Huangshixian Island in Chongqing and Hubei province, we have a service base. In response to the expansion of the whole overseas market, we have also completed the design of a subsidiary in Southeast Asia Thailand Bangkok, as well as the Indian Qinglan.

The following are some of our more representative manufacturers. The main customers, his ethnic clusters in hard-wired circuit boards, IC carrier boards, and other photoelectric semiconductor manufacturing industries. The main representative customers include forest technology, emerging electronics and Nanya circuit boards, as well as semiconductor parts, moonlight and fine ling, as well as UMC and TSMC. The current operating headquarters is expected to be open in August this year, his frequency is about 3600 square feet, and his current location is now located in the entire Xinpu area, the mainland is about 15 minutes, and the point is about 90 minutes.

As shown below, a review of staff and a goal execution plan can be implemented to achieve the whole reality and reality, and a major energy control, and then a monitoring and analysis, and an internal review with us, to provide managers with an optimal goal of reviewing a goal with a salary tax. We will also build a system solution for this new plant. Corporate social responsibility, we participated in a charity event four times last year, and we participated in the Lutheran College Bard Park event, which lasted for almost 20 years. We also joined the ASD Foundation last year, as well as a pop-up concert in April and November. In addition to the end of last year, we also invited our staff and family members to join the Lutheran Prayer Meeting.

So we also want to participate in the upcoming events, as long as there are some public welfare activities, we will also participate. Next, I will talk about the operation, even after nearly six years of revenue performance, since the year 2019 after the 27th, continued to break through more than 10 billion in 2020, we have not broken more than 1 billion in almost years, we have not broken more than 1 billion revenue.

In encouraging the policy part, we maintain a stable incentive policy, so we have recently configured the following situation, cash incentive payment ratio is no lower than the profit distribution of unit revenue, and the amount of cash incentive to be limited to 10% of the total. I also hope that every year we have an encouraging performance, we can be more than 1, 2 pieces of performance. We also occupy a common meeting in the last year, and now in the province, we can continue to occupy the occupation. Now I do the following outlook and explain the strategy, we have the product re-planning, choose the concept of AVR IoT, our main core is the application of AI mechanical visual, and then the intelligent solution of master process, and production automation, and we will expand into the integration of semiconductor application on the carrier board, as well as the overseas products, can be able to cross-field production, the entire food and clean equipment, as well as well as carbon integration of intelligent manufacturing, energy storage and energy storage and energy storage equipment.

In the planning and strategy of products, in the infrastructure today in March 2025.

We have completed the establishment of the Thai subsidiary this year, and we have obtained orders for optical inspection and measurement as well as private equipment. As the left is an online AOA order, we also continue to arrange shipping and installation and hole-related inspection and testing equipment. We also have privately-built front and rear auxiliary and ultrasound cleaning equipment, as well as AI image filter throughout the application and testing machine high pressure equipment and text flight. Of course, after our Thai subsidiary was founded, we can provide this service directly to customers in Thailand.

As far as the right side is concerned, we have already received soft board modules and double-sided shredders as well as arm type PX checkers and horizontal winged rubber checkers as well as eagle winged rubber checkers. Of course, we have continued to deliver the battery module look checkers on the vehicle. This order continues last year's entire energy and we hope to ship the goods before June and bring new functionality to revenue. In addition to our long-term AI image drop points, we also want to cross the creative industry outside of the PCB field, which may be in the food industry or medicine or even automotive assembly industry. We also have a multi-industry development of this kind of cell planning is in progress.

The following is an overview of the various defects we are able to see through LED vision through the whole ultra-low color defect section. The entire ultra-low color defect section can be presented through our special light source so that the whole people can not be made visible through exclusive optical vision. It can make the darkness in the darkness without escape and solve the problems encountered in the industry's biggest problems in the present industry is the pain point of all customers.

The first device that has been completed in our factory has now been scheduled to test that the completion of this device combined with Japan double-cabinet cooperation can bring a new dynamic to our revenue. The next product is the two devices with GNC in cooperation with the semiconductor seal test, of course GNC, which was the two automations of the VK series last year, and then we completed the VR and VHS series automations this year. So I have been able to provide the complete testing needs for the entire VK VR VHS series, whether it is the two up and down automations of the VK VR VHS series to complete the two combinations that also greatly shorten the original manual measurement from the original can be achieved in just over 25 minutes, and then increase the authenticity of the data repeating to achieve a full quantification from the original draw.

In addition to measuring the thickness of the bottom traffic of the wafer and the label of the wafer in the direction of the metallurgy, the whole automation and AOI together with the integration of the automation and optical testing of the equipment of the chipping machine, we have now completed the automation of the chipping machine labeling machine and labeling machine three parts of the machine, and the main optical marking machine is to do a layer of automatic labeling card after the whole function side of the automatic labeling card is removed after we read the positive labeling distribution of the material on the back of the OCR and then detect the automatic intelligent TV and re-label the wafer side of the same. In addition to the certification of CMS2 and FH447, this unique feature I have mentioned throughout the light source, we have also made the configuration and color check and back check optical system of positive inspection optical system for different requirements of customers in the process of testing we are going to check a defect of various types of white pots and some shortcomings of the eye film position and film cleaning position. The color check section examines the defects of our entire wafer, of course, we use the exclusive design of the two arms to carry a bar.

So, we're going to try to minimize the size of the machine, so we're going to do two pieces of the whole effect in 15.5 seconds. That's why we're not using AI with this soft shell algorithm, so we can, because the technology in wafer temperature scratches can be removed, improve the removal rate, and then bring out the whole difference in the unique specialty can be done. That way42way, without Diametric, we have such an alternative, it has a feature algorithm we can try to make the whole background contrast higher, so it's not easy to make mistakes and leaks.

This kind of scenario application is not limited to the bottom level of the circuit board of our mobile phone, as Fang said we may be in the automotive industry or in the current food industry, in the pharmaceutical industry, we have provided such a system, and now also with the customer in the planning of the whole system, in progress. Just mentioned the part of the energy-saving system, the eternal period has been, along with the long-term, attention to that long-term, so we said in our own privately made applications, he can also bring the whole energy saving, of course, the function is, room temperature out of the wind, to reduce the problem of long-term water consumption, there is also indirectly to reduce the amount of ice water consumption, and then can do to save energy.

In addition to this OEM, we also represent the entire Korean surface treatment of this potion, so he also has special technical application for production, so the production force has greatly increased, so the OEM application of the chain, a process of the machine, and then the pressure, and then set up the certification that we want to start this year. This is the description of a commodity today. Thank you, Vice President Chen, we are now welcome to welcome customers, if you have any questions, thank you.

Dexing is now Dexing two, and we may all know that, originally Dexing one, the earliest Dexing was established before 1930, at that time there was, to be a Hantec supplier, the establishment of a company, the company, the company. Dexing two is now after a year and a year and a half, it looks good, so Dexing two is going to join the ten companies, the purpose is to say, not only in Taiwan, but also to enter the service group, focus on the industry, in the application of these companies we are interested in together.

You help me, say that there is follow, this is our, proof right, exchange or member here to do, because there are many companies here are also listed companies, and then in the integration company, so the purpose of this company in the future is that we have an IPO or SPO, when they will be involved, mainly here. The second is that we also do a channel together, like American comrades now.



The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim script:. We have introduced funds to the layout of some important subjects. Be sure to make it work. It should be done there. But the ASB of that machine should be different. It will be a lot.

Yes. The price is, of course. It's different from the whole world. So like us now, there is a clean part. We are the original. The water that is required is not able to have a metal ion at all, as we say our own basic connection, the overall use of these accessories machines is different from it.

So if you want to receive a lot of things, this is not going to happen. So in our case all of us are honest guesses that many of us are masters who have to be relevant right now is their own tool, and now we are afraid to produce a TV directly, our goal is to produce a TV directly, and our goal is to be able to change the nature of the market, but the last thing to do is to judge the foundry.

That's what we did last year. But the direction was very easy and time-consuming for the goods to be adjusted quickly. It's now not in front of these referees, which we started from the second half of last year. That's because there may be some structure in the operation.

There are a few things we need to do right now, but we also have the equipment to do this kind of work.

It's now, in fact, whether we're automated, or optical systems, we're heavy, and we're doing what we're doing now.

If there is a future, there is a future. Yes, there is. I have been involved in the past. But the future is obviously writing. That is why I set up a company.

It's the right thing to do. It's just automation. In fact, every company's automation direction is different, for example.

He does automation. But automation is the choice between the equipment and the equipment. We have our own automation is a stone. My equipment is the unit here. Don't let it be the equipment.

I want to put something into my suitcase and do it all. I'm talking about things that I'm not going to do, but I'm not going to do it.

So we have to think about it, so its properties are not duplicated, but I'm from here, I'm like, we have a family.

There is little. There is little that is made of plastic. I may be the device of the future. I need to have an attack on the plastic. It is a piece that I can do. He is handing it to us.

Let this set go, put it into your device, I have left it together, that's because we're in God's land, so he's talking directly to us.

I'm going to say this, I'm going to say it's going to be a big one, but it's going to be that way, right here, right here, right here, right here, right here.

This is why we went to the previous densing К, this is google, this is going to come in slowly, when we have a new factory has a relatively large cost.

Our Bizmodel will become a health. This product line actually has a part of the agent. There is an agent. This is the place where our company is more different. This agent is actually not going back at the same time. I don't do it today because I bring another product.

So I left him. He left. He competed with his friends. Or we were all together. So we could continue to work with some new companies.

When you are not yellow lined, just say that you have checked some Cost. No. We are the part of the agent. Like the recent case said, the entire transformation in the PCB industry.

He actually said it would be systemic. It was originally these manufacturers who provided these devices. Maybe not so much about systemicization. Now it's actually selling this device as an agent. Almost all add value to him. Throughout the entire system for the client factory.

The part of wisdom. It is invested by the R&D staff of the Associated Press. The value of doing this part. So the factory only provides his core technology. We connect the factory with the entire system. All work is done by the Associated Press.

So we don't generally exist. I will actually help this product in the community. There is a value-added service in the client. There is also a value-added presence. So in this aspect of government. And.

This part is. This year it was just mentioned as an optical AV working with Japan. I think it is a major project of a relatively high growth. Then it is a private device. This is due to the need for expansion.

Throughout Thailand. Private equipment will also grow throughout the expansion needs. Then again, it is part of the optical equipment for cell phone module assembly. This part is actually going to continue to be prepared until now. In fact, this year is only a new model, new applications, new inspections.

That's apart from the original customers. We're expanding new customers. It's a system that evolves the original electronic version. Then follows the entire semiconductor. We're in addition to a variety of system integrations. Then there's a new demand for the entire market in Thailand just mentioned.

We have equipment installed. It was a steady growth that we could see throughout the year. I would definitely like to have a new high that can be challenged. This is a new business.

The water was already proxy. We are more highly-adjusted to Polisat. So why is it above the characteristics of this product in high frequency. This water is more practical. So just to say that we spend 20 million to strengthen the equipment. I need this water.

I'm tall, but it's our sub-project, so it's about the business of potion, so we're going to do some certifications later.

It takes a little bit of time, so part of the certification is to enter this second is the potion, and in fact, it can not be changed, so it is a relatively stable business, and we are doing the part now.

What we do now is because of the ability of our RD. With our customers' RD if there are some possible. We will think that it will be very suitable for us with these potions. So it is a special potion that is suitable for our products.

With that next main R&D ability, because it is a process of construction. I thank you. We are the world. It is a need. So now there are about 30 people.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the original text must be kept intact.

First, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like most of the content is a discussion about the company's products, technical differences, and customer feedback, and finally there is a series of repeated appeals like, subscriptions, etc. It should be noted that timestamps may indicate the start time of the conversation, but users do not request a retention timestamp, so it may need to be removed.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete or oral, such as "hmmm", "haha", etc., which need to be kept in their original position and cannot be deleted. For example, "hmmm" and "yes" may belong to the same person's response, should be combined. In the process, I need to make sure that each original sentence is in the same order, just segment them to make reading smoother. For example, the parts of AI systems and customer selection may be divided into several paragraphs, each paragraph discusses different technical points or customer feedback.

Finally, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all the contents are properly converted and no additional content is added. Especially the last duplicate appeal part, although duplicated, but must be reserved all the time, it may be necessary to use ellipses or paragraphs to handle them, but the user does not specifically explain how to handle duplicated content, so keep it as it should.

4. Dealing with duplicate content, such as the last call part, may need to be segmented or merged. 5. Make sure that the verbal stopovers such as "hmmm", "haha" remain in the original position. 6. Finally check that all content is complete, in correct order, format conforms to the requirements.

The problem is that there is a very strong one now, is that it is more common, of course, which one he needs, this part of the requirement. If the company is testing this part, because the company has a history before you enter, so we often tend to be poor, I am more focused on the needs of the smart value. If the test this part, in fact, we have too much of the same, the first one is our application in AI, this part is basically what we have in common, we have both customers certification, so some of our AI software is actually in the product of the tree.

When the equipment visual inspection product, in fact, he did not standardize, very visual, so as long as you go into the culture, you do it, this is competitive for you, you do well to do the same. So although all speak of the testing company, but really does not match, in the application is really good. Well, although there are individual differences, you do not say that we are particularly strong, that is, we are more, good, you want to mention? We should say that the inspection part is actually similar, but because everyone is from the circuit industry, in fact, each process needs inspection and measurement, in fact, the unique point is not the same.
