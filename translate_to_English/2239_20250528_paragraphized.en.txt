<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided to see how these verbatim texts are reorganized into consecutive paragraphs.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a briefing on the impact of the Sino-US trade war, production base distribution, product classification, and so on. Each section has multiple sentences, some of which may belong to the same topic and need to be merged into paragraphs. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit.

It is important to note that some sentences may repeat or have timestamped jumps, such as [23. 94-30.00] and [30. 00-33.98], but the content may belong to the same part. In addition, some sentences may be inserted in the middle to ensure that the logic between paragraphs is smooth. During the processing process, I will check every step of the way to make sure that there is no missing content and in the order of timestamps. At the same time, to avoid adding any connection words or modifying the original sentences to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the originals.

If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the timestamps and contents again to make sure there is no error. </think> [paragraph verbatim transcription]: Hello everyone, I am a spokesperson for English.

The briefing is divided into three parts: the first part of the company profile, the second part of the operation overview, and the third part of our future outlook. The first part of the company profile. Our Cayman Indian Industrial Co., Ltd., was founded in 2015, but in the beginning of 1990, we were located in Jilin Northeast, China, Jilin Province, is set up in the northeast side of Jilin Province, China, then we are engaged in the anti-collision system of the body parts, and the entire design research and development, manufacturing and sales.

That is, our main business is in fact, more than 99% of our business is in mainland China. In fact, investors have recently asked that it is the US-China, not the US-China trade war, that the US tariff war has no direct effect on us. That is, we have statistically outsourced goods to us there is very little.

In the process, we also came into contact with the business in addition to the mass system, such as the Mercedes or BMW, and in the near future, we are also actively expanding the independent brand in mainland China, the new manufacturing power of the new side of the business. The investment structure here, we opened the British here is to hold our Changchun Engley Automobile Industrial Co., Ltd., not the company, the whole production of the subject of this yellow, this Changchun Engley Automobile Industrial Co., Ltd., we are the main business in mainland China. Here, please take a look at the side of the production base, in fact, we have set up a production base in the whole mainland from north to south, east to west, so it can meet the supply demand of most automobile manufacturers. [227. 50-233.] Our company is actually in the process development, in fact, is always focused on the application of the whole of the automotive materials and technology of light of the process.

It is also one of our leading advantages. Our products are mainly divided into two parts, which are divided into metal products and non-metal products. The metal products can refer to this page, then we can compare the simple metal forming, it may be more simple after stamping formed parts, then it is actually made more complex assembly parts, it is formed by forming through forming, then we will be sold by welding, then we will be sold to our customers. Here is such as the front weight of the dashboard, then the bottom of the body plate, then the threshold of the side of the plate, then the side of the plate, then the side of the plate, then the side of the car, and then the side of the side of the side of the car.

We know that in terms of the characteristics of metal, the density of the aluminum is lighter than steel, and that in fact, we and our connected customers, the use of aluminum is more and more, so we also invested in this aluminum extrusion line. The aluminum extrusion process, which is to form some parts that can be used in the car, such as anti-collision beams, pedestrian protection beams, battery shells, chassis brackets, instrument brackets, side frame. We established this production line in Changchun Hanyi, mainly is to supply to our company's own group to use. We have two production lines completed, this is 3150 tons of aluminum pole and 4500 tons of aluminum poles have been built, and then we started to supply it to other fields.

We also have a lot of aluminum alloy parts for your reference. Our company is a lightweight part that has been doing this variety of materials to combine. That is the core of our company, whether it is in the existing customers to help customers plan this lightweight or to contact new customers, it is a good entry point. For example, like the full packaging frame, the package bracket he actually has a variety of tools that can combine different materials, we can do, and the other parts such as the structure of the body, the battery housing, in fact, we have developed a variety of different materials combination process, and here are also in the supply.

The gross profit margin can be seen that this year's gross profit margin is higher in Q1, which is mainly because our Q1 production capacity is also lower, the steel and aluminum raw materials are also higher here affect our gross profit margin. The second part is our operation profile, from our current operating customers here to see, Q1 here in 2025 we can see that our largest supply customer is probably also close to 40%, then Beijing Mercedes is probably 19.5%, VOVOVO Group is about 8.1 15%, and then the fourth largest customer is Biadi, then Biadi is in our customer accounted for more than this customer accounted for, which is we say, for example, we said, at the beginning of our group's revenue is almost from European brands, but now we can see that in the past Chinese auto brands are the first choice for people, then in the transformation of electric vehicles, and we are willing to buy electric vehicles in China.

Good morning everyone, good morning. Here are some related reports.

First, in the first quarter of 2025, our revenue declined by 14%. That was the main reason for his decline. The main reason for his decline was because he was just like us. FIRON reported that he was squeezed by new energy vehicles like a traditional car model.

This part of the company is. It will gradually increase its stickiness to the new car model. Then we will increase our revenue. Then it will be the gross profit rate he followed. The same period last year compared to last year there was a decline.

He is mainly because of ours. With his clients, his prices are reduced, and the cost of raw materials is rising. And that is because of revenue. Operating. So the distribution of fixed costs is relatively high.

Then there is the turnover rate of revenues. Some of his days are higher than others. In the first quarter, our revenues were lowered relatively high that year. The number of days calculated is longer.

For the main customer his price is still on. So some stocks are not. The price is not yet confirmed. The price has not yet shipped. The part of that is that he has to make sure the price is good with the customer. Overall, in the first quarter, our EPS was negative 3.48.

There is a relatively low price. Revenue and gross profit margin for YY Hong Kong reported a 14% drop and then a 17% drop in QOQ. That's what we're talking about. Some of the capital expenditures here can be seen as our main capital expenditure is in 2023 and 2024. That's mainly because of us.

We have a new lid in Changchun Red Han. Aluminum extrusion production line is so. More investment in more capital expenditure. The other is that the portion of Hefei is because of the Anhui people and some future orders. So we also have in Hefei.

A new production line was built. That's it. 25 years later. From now on, we're not comparable. A larger capital expenditure. The cost summary of this part.

This is mainly due to the decline in revenue in the first quarter. The ratio is calculated to be relatively high. In particular, this is the ratio. The ratio is relatively high, just mentioned Changchun Honghan and Hefei two plants.

It was completed in 2024 and then the machine equipment began. Production was used. All were converted to a fixed nature to amortize. So this was the case with a reference to depreciation. The proportion of the depreciation cost of the quotation is relatively high. The ratio of financial costs is 1.6%.

This is because of the decline in revenue so he. This is a relatively high proportion. But in fact, our finances. The part of the fee for this interest will be because. The interest rate of the Euro is reduced so he. The exchange rate part of the first quarter because.

The exchange rate. The euro depreciated significantly in late March, so we did. The quoted loss of unrealized exchange was 2.100 million at the end of the first quarter. This is the same as the 2.11 of the earnings report. The last part is what we look forward to in the future.

And it shall come to pass, as we have said before, that in the beginning there shall be a crown of righteousness, and in the end there shall be a crown of righteousness, and a crown of righteousness, and we shall be like unto it.

Developed the composite material of this liquid stitching. Do something that can hold. The strength of the product and make it lightweight. The ability to produce more advantage. And then to promote to our customers.

That's basically it. As you all know, it's actually the auto market in China, especially in so many auto brands.

He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest.

These are more advanced techniques and management. To be more advanced. In addition to that, the company also has a few expansions. In addition to some businesses outside of the city, we are also connected.

This is a large household appliance brand. The founding of metal parts, of course, is what we want to say is that in the car market conditions may be comparable. We can use these. The opportunity to fill us.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the structure.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. The example provided by the user has some timestamps and sentences, such as [1575. 06-1578. 40] The client gives Forecasts to the market, and then there are other sentences. I need to sort these sentences in logical order into paragraphs while keeping the order of the timestamps unchanged. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or conversation in order to make a reasonable segmentation.

In addition, there are some repetitive "thank you" and technical questions and answers that may require separate paragraphs. It is important to note that the user mentions "not to delete any sentences", so even if some sentences don't seem coherent or duplicated, such as "thank you" that appears multiple times, they also need to be retained. At the same time, some sentences may contain non-Chinese content, such as "Raspberry", "Yard", etc., which may be erroneous or background noise, but also need to be retained as well. During the process, I will sort by order to ensure that the sequence of timestamps is correct and segmented according to the consistency of the content.

In addition, be aware that some sentences may be wrongly divided, such as "[1621. 92-1628. 06] The currency force, in fact, is in addition to looking at the impact of the exchange rate of Taiwan dollar here on this side of the exchange rate," followed by "that is to say we follow," and needs to confirm whether it belongs to the same paragraph. According to the context, these sentences discuss the effect of the force and capacity, and should be combined into a paragraph. Finally, check whether there are missing sentences or timestamp errors to ensure that all content is arranged correctly, and there is no missing part. After the completion, read the whole paragraph type script again, confirm the smoothness and accuracy, while adhering all the user's requirements.

In the end, we have a very big difference in the market. So we haven't even been able to consolidate, that is to say, a long Forecast cycle may be a benchmark for the year's annual customer, but it won't be distorted. What is the revenue of the year? What is the current revenue outlook, we estimate with our current Forecast, this year's revenue is probably the same as last year's level.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Excuse me, I just seem to be in a bit of a bad situation. Is that right? Well, that's usually the only thing I'm going to say is, the price drop is usually what we're going to call the annual drop, which is a part of the start of supply that may be fixed down by three percentage points, etc. This drop is actually the additional requirement of the customer in the year down, the demand for the drop, the main thing is that now the roll in the mainland market is more serious.

This is the first time that we have seen this price drop happen to us. The gross profit margin is actually a one-time occurrence, because although we are actively in the transformation, not to say that the transformation is equal to the situation of information, which is the situation of information, that is to say, to do some new customers to these Chinese brands of car factory customers, but in the present ratio, we have about 70% of the customers from European car brands.

I said from the middle of this opening out of the table that this place is mostly here, there is the cost of this place may immediately learn the name of Raspberry Yard and debris point is 부탁Please welcome the reward for us and the decline in revenue in recent years, but the gross interest rate decreases every year, but the cost has been rising, how to improve in the future? Here we are explained here is our gross interest rate he fell year by year, mainly because from 2021, because the price of raw materials has been rising, until now there is a relatively high water level, is the price is a relatively high state. Although there is a relatively low decline in the middle, but now we start to rise, so we actually before the gross interest rate is because of this part of the raw material.

Generally, a one-off price drop is usually at the end of the year to the beginning of the year, and the customer may communicate with the supplier according to the situation above. Therefore, the demand for this year's decline, in fact, has been a little earlier than this year, even from the end of last year there was a discussion.

[2087. 72-2089. 42] So the processing rate is not high. [2099. 80-2103. 98] is the current investors, we know that the question management team has answered. [2106. 04-2113. 12] We know that the company will actively strive to achieve the so-called new energy here in 2025. [2118. 02-2127. 92] Therefore, we will continue to improve performance and strive to fight for the parts of the free brand on the so-called mainland. [2129. 12-2134. 26] If you are investing advanced online, today's online explanation may be a paragraph if you do not want to ask questions.

[2134. 26-2141. 64] If you have any further questions after the meeting, you can also send them to Ms. Wu's mailbox, thank you Mogo. [2141. 64-2152. 06] Do not thank today's online profit management team, we also thank you for your investment in advanced participation in today's online legal statement will come to this paragraph.
