Welcome to the Taiwan Communications Corporation, you are very welcome to participate in the briefing session of the Taiwan Communications Corporation. Next, we will introduce you to the online operation team: Mr. Cai Kunzhong, you are welcome to invest in advanced people, you are welcome to invest in advanced media, you are welcome to invest in advanced people, you are welcome to invest in advanced media, you are welcome to invest in advanced afternoon, you are welcome to invest in advanced media, you are welcome to invest in advanced media, you are welcome to invest in advanced media friends, you are welcome to present the results of Taiwan Communications Corporation's operation and future prospects.

However, because the information content still involves some of these risks and uncertainties that our company can not control, so there may be a significant difference between the actual results and the expected situation, so please remember not to rely too much on this information, and if you do not want to be arbitrarily enabled, the detailed contents of this brief is the trouble you refer to. The outline of this brief is divided into four parts: the first will first explain the company's operation, the next will tell us the trend of our industry to buy and sell mining, and then will tell us the direction and strategy of the company's operation, and finally make a final conclusion.

The first is the construction of the ship is about 70% from 113, then 55% from 112 to 61% from 113, which maintains a high percentage. The part of the merchant ship is that the part of the ship construction section is 23% in 2011, the second is 26% in 112, and the third is 7% from 113, so this becomes the part of our company to fight hard. The second is also the maintenance of the ship, about 5% in 111, 8% in 112, and 8% in 113 years. The other is in terms of the ship construction, the mechanism and the seaworks, 111% in 2011, but the other works are very maintenance, please refer to it.

There is a hand-held order, which we have in general, two marine data check vessels, two back-wheels of 21,000 tonnes, and two other options, the 8700 rear-wheels of 12, and four other options, so the general merchant ships have a total of 17. That in terms of the gold and the official ships, there is a prototype ship with a shallow ship, plus a naval service one, a 4000 tonnes of warships, a 1000 tonnes of warships, and six high-latitude ocean guardships, and a 100 tonnes of drive-boats, where there are 14.

In addition, we are in Kaohsiung ship company, electric driving, including the 49 tons of electric ferries, and the 99 tons of electric ferries, allysian, successfully delivered on January 16 and December 30, and another 49 tons of electric cruise port ferries, and on September 2 successfully delivered on November 28. The following is a description of our company's A-2 aircraft under construction on November 28, which is a large floating float of marine diving insurance, a seaweed emerald wheel.

Agra 2025 Taiwan Excellence Gold Award is the highest accolade. Next, let's talk about our industry trends and career development. First, let's talk about the overview of the shipbuilding market. Here you can see the picture. We can show this picture after the 2008 financial tsunami. The whole shipbuilding began to fall.

The boat price also followed a significant decline. It began to pick up after COVID-19 in 2020. The whole boat was also picking up. So the price of the new boat came back. The boat started to pick up relatively high. The boat started to have a better chance of development.

Another trend is the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which has the original shipping environmental regulations. Compulsory regulations regulate carrier carbon emissions. In addition to the EU 2026, carbon tax will also be introduced.

So now in a green ship. Energy is eco-friendly like methanol double fuel. LNG fuel Ammonia double fuel as well as electric hybrid boat. It is a future development trend. That is in terms of market share.

Our global market for new shipbuilders. Let China, South Korea, Japan be covered. 92% of the world's new shipbuilders. It can also be seen from here. Especially China, which is attached to this country's support and policy subsidies. It has gradually expanded its market share.

That's why it's 2024. China shipyards in mainland China. Whether it's the acceptance of orders on new ships. The first order quantity is high and the world's number one. And all of them are up to 5% of the market share.

Shipping companies also want to have an equal point of competition. They want to fight for this government to support the industry policy of this merchant ship. In order to maintain China's shipbuilding industry and talent cultivation. That in the new shipbuilding industry. The potential business of the new shipbuilding company.

The first is the 8700 rear liner. There is a submarine behind that. And there are other functions of the sea cruiser. That sea line has 2000 tonnes of new ships. And 8000 tonnes of new ships. That is, offshore wind power.

Potential business includes wind cabins developed like the third stage of air block development. Fans of underwater machines. Then there is a demonstration wind farm of the clothing fan. The float of the clothing fan. And the heavy construction of offshore wind power transportation business.

We have cooperated with NTU Ship Center. This 15M fan semi-submersible research and development program. It also has the contribution of the ABS society of American Ship Class Society. It also has the contribution of the ABS society of American Ship Class Society. Recognition. Let's go to the next part.

It is about business strategy and direction. First of all, there is an adjustment in the business strategy of Taiwan shipbuilding company. That is, we will start to focus and deduct the large shipbuilding business. That is mainly because there are four large companies in Taiwan shipbuilding company in the past.

It is now taken into account the use of resources. It should be used effectively. So we are currently focusing on the shipbuilding and merchant shipbuilding industry. And the state of the shipbuilding.

Next, I'll explain the strategic approach to our business development. This is the one that comes with our new management. It's the new chairman and general manager. There are also a number of strategies. That's what it means. That's what we're going to do to manage the transformation of digital transformation and the transformation of innovation.

The chairman proposed several. The strategic approach included human resources and organization management. Finance and money management technology and product innovation. Decentralized policy and social cooperation. And global economic challenges to supply chain management.

We have developed a number of development strategies. Mainly in terms of interior design, for example. This KPI will probably be strengthened, as well as human heritage, and then reconstruct the order. That is also in terms of finance and money management.

Hope to reduce costs. Increase some niche business. Enhance finance. Technology and product innovation. Focus on smart shipyards. The development of smart ships with dual fuels, as well as unmanned ships.

The development of the clothing fan service counter. The government's social cooperation will be greatly reduced. The cooperation of the iron chain will attract excellent talents. It will also strengthen the research and development of innovative products of external cooperation.

In addition, global supply. Economic challenges to supply chain management. It will strengthen the management of the supply chain. It will then develop local business sources. Strengthen the security. The future of the company is special.

Just mentioned that we will focus on smart and green energy. There are probably four main areas of green energy production. One is the management of green energy production. This includes an inventory of greenhouse gases. Air compressor monitoring system. Solar panels of the plant and cooling systems of the plant.

In addition, in the field of smart shipyard. Energy monitoring system will be developed. Welder management system. Aerial truck positioning monitoring system.

The third block is Power Smart. It develops multi-fueled ships. Power advances the ship and unmanned ships.

In addition, the subsidiaries include the power supply of Taiwan. The focus will be on the material capacity and power system. That ship ring the sea. It will be for the energy-soft marine business.

In addition, in terms of operational improvement strategy. In order to optimize operation and sustainability. The Company will actively develop strategies for operational improvement. To achieve the goal of profit-making, we will soon achieve the goal of profit-making.

The first focus will be on the expansion of the core business. Mainly the various prototype ships that the company has undertaken in recent years. It is likely that the ship has been or is about to be completed.

That's what we currently hold. It's full by 2030. That's why it's very beneficial. Our company is doing internal renovations. We can also look into the future of R&D. And long-term stability.

So the interior. Our first is driven by profit. This is internal transformation driven by profit. Increase competitiveness. Mainly in conjunction with existing businesses for profit-oriented purposes.

The program is improved. [1214. 44-1215. 44] The program is improved. [1215. 44-1219. 44] The new performance evaluation mechanism has been developed. [1219. 44-1223. 44] The first part is the integration of resources.

[1226. 44-1229. 44] Focus on the energy of intelligence and capacity renewal. [1229. 44-1232. 44] Integrate the parent company and its subsidiaries. [1232. 44-1236. 44] There is research and development energy of domestic industry colleges, etc. [1236. 44-1239. 44] Focus on intelligence and follow-up ability into research and development. [1239. 44-1243. 44] Develop a variety of products and services with market potential. [1244. 44-1247. 44] Thank you for your presentation today.

**Q&A** [1274. 44-1277. 44] Please indicate your company's shipping and name thank you. [1286. 44-1288. 44] [1288. 44-1291. 44] First of all, we would like to reply. [1291. 44-1294. 44] The first question is if investors ask. [1294. 44-1298. 44] Whether the boat has a chance to transfer in 2025. [1298. 44-1300. 44] This section should be explained first.

[1300. 44-1304. 44] We saw a total loss of 27. 8% last year. [1304. 44-1308. 44] That was over 200 billion in turnover this year. [1308. 44-1312. 44] But still in this situation as well as shipping prices. [1312. 44-1317. 44] Therefore, there is no opportunity to make a profit in this part. [1317. 44-1321. 44] But the amount of this loss will be greatly reduced. [1321. 44-1325. 44] But the amount is not suitable for external explanation.

[1325. 44-1329. 44] That second question is whether the submarine has the opportunity to continue to develop. [1329. 44-1333. 44] That part of the answer to our investors. [1333. 44-1336. 44] Basically my frontline prototyping ship is now on our way. [1336. 44-1341. 44] We will have a test drive in October. [1341. 44-1343. 44] We will submit this year according to the contract node. [1343. 44-1347. 44] But the subsequent parts may be all media concerned about this issue.

[1347. 44-1353. 44] and investment advanced already known. [1353. 44-1355. 44] The Legislative Yuan has passed two follow-up cases for our follow-up. [1355. 44-1361. 44] and the whole case. [1361-1363. 44] It is a very important plan. [1363. 44-1356. 44] Although there is a so-called freeze in this court. [1366. 44-1370. 44] The budget of the year 114 is 50%.

[1370. 44-1375. 44] 50% can be used. [1375. 44-1377. 44] Basically our submarine is the look. [1377. 44-1380. 44] The next seven ships will continue until 2038. [1385. 44-1391. 44] This one of our boats will work with the Navy. [1391-1393. 44] And then it will be carried out in accordance with the original plan. [1393. 44-1393. 44-1393. 44] One of the following seven cases will continue to be carried out.

[1397. 44-1404. 44] is absolutely not affected. [1400. 44-1404. 44] Another is referring to the Emerald Wheel. [1442. 44-1446. 44] Sorry for the revenue of that Emerald Wheel. [1446. 44-1449. 44] It is not suitable for business secrets. [1449. 44-1451. 44] But the prospect of marine engineering. [1451. 44] We are basically just the sea dragons.

[1454. 44-1475. 44] has ended quickly. [1457. 44-1459. 44] But we recently got it. [1459. 44-1461. 44] So we made use of the emerald wheel. [1466. 44-1468. 44] Is a subsidiary of the Taiwan ship. [1468. 44-1472. 44] At least 114 115 years. [1472. 44-1475. 44] The prospect of maritime engineering is very optimistic.

[1475. 44-1477. 44] The fifth issue. [1477. 44-1481. 44] Since the years since the Marine Corps was provided. [1481 44-1483. 44] The fact is that we are part and parcel of this part is from CDWE. [1487. 44-1449. 44] The other part is from our subsidiary. [1494. 44-1498. 44] The other part is from the previous year.

[1498. 44-1532. 44.1524.44.1537] [4437.1537.44.1537] [4437.1537.4415.44.1537] [4437.1537.4415.4415.44.1537] [4437.15.4415.44.1537] [4437.1537.4415.4415.44.1537] [441537.4415.441537] [441537.1537.4415.4415.44.441537] [441537.441537] [441537.4415.441537] [441537.4415.45.1537] [441537.4415.441537] [441537.441537.441537.441537.44.441537] [4415.4415.4415.4415.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537.44.44.44.44.44.4415.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537] 44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537] 44.441537.45.441537.44.44.44.45.44.44.44.441537] 44.441537.441537] 44.441537.441537.441537.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537.441537] 44.441537] 44.441537] 44.44.441537] 44.44.44.44.441537] 44.441537] 44.441537] 44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537.44.441537.441537.441537.44.44.44.44.44.441537.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.441537 [44.44 44 [1537. 4437-1537] [4437.1537. 4437.1537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537.44.1537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537.441537] [4437.1537] [4437.1537.441537.44] [441537.1537] [441537.1537.441537.44] [441537.44] [441537.1537.441537.44] [441537.1537.44] [441537.1537.441537.44] 441537. 44.44] 44. 44.44] 44.4447.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44. 44.441537. 44. 44. 44. 44. 44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.1537] 44.44.1537.1537.1537. 44.44.1537.1537.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.1537.1537.44.44.1537.44.44.441537.4537.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.444537.44.44.1537] 44.44.44.44.44.44.44.1537] 44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.1537.1537.44.44.44.1537.44.44.44.44.44.44.1537.44.44.1537.1537.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.44.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and organize it into paragraph transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I check the transcription fragments provided by the user one by one, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences. The user has divided the content into multiple entries, each with timeframes and text content.

First, I will observe whether there are duplicate sentences. For example, [1773. 44-1774. 44] and [1774. 44-1775. 44] are the exact same sentences and may need to be merged. However, according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so the two sentences must be retained, but the format may need to be adjusted to avoid repeating the highlighting. Then, I will deal with the continuity of the timestamp. Some timestamps are continuous, such as [1775. 44-1779. 44] after [1779. 44-1772. 44], which may mean that these sentences are continuous and should be merged into a paragraph. However, it is necessary to determine whether there is a natural pause or topic transition.

In addition, some sentences may belong to the same topic, such as the shipbuilding plan for offshore wind turbines, followed by discussion of the revenue of the Taiwan Sea, which may require segmentation processing. At the same time, note whether the interval between timestamps is large, which may mean that the topic is converted, and appropriate segmentation is required. During the process, I will check the contents of the duplicate or redundant, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so all sentences must be kept. For example, [1804. 44-1805. 44-1806. 44], [1805 44-1806], 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 1806, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 1806.

In addition, pay attention to whether the format of the timestamp is correct, whether there are typographical or timestamp errors. For example, after [1863. 44-1869. 70], is there any omission in the middle? It is necessary to confirm the continuity of the timestamp, but the data provided by the user may be correct, so it is handled as it is. When dealing with investment-related issues, such as whether Wanhai has signed a contract, it is necessary to ensure that all relevant sentences are correctly categorized into the same paragraph, such as [1863. 44-1869. 70] to [1923. 42-1926. 82] may belong to the same topic and need to be merged into paragraphs.

After finishing the preliminary preparation, I will read through the whole paragraph to confirm that everything has been properly merged, no omissions or errors, and that it meets all the requirements of the user. Especially to ensure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all the original sentences are kept in order and appropriate segmentation to improve readability.

This part of the discussion is also a very early period, so it is unlikely that the ship owner will accept offshore wind turbines after 2031, so it is expected that the ship owner will be less likely to accept offshore wind turbines after 2031 to build offshore wind turbines, and in 2020 to build offshore wind turbines. In addition, our legal advisers will ask about the revenue of the Taiwan ship around the sea, and then our legal advisers will ask about the revenue of the Taiwan ship around the sea, such as the outlook of 2025.

This part we have signed with our so-called investment friends, we have signed the contract, we have signed the contract on January 15, so we have signed the contract, so the contract has been signed, so the contract for 12 contracts has been signed on January 15. The rest of the traders, we just mentioned that our current master file is already in 2030, so even if there are any other new vessels, that can be changed to build, etc., then we will look at the duration of the vessel we need, as well as the budget cost of the ship, etc., and that the ship will do well.

So basically this part is to explain to you the advanced investment, which is what we are talking about is very different from what we are talking about. The other part is whether the defense budget is good for the Taiwan ship, I want to increase our defense budget is not good for the Taiwan ship, the defense budget is not two, one is the state-owned, the other is for the sea cruise, perhaps it has its own so-called cruise defense state requirements. Therefore, we may have to invest in friends to see a little bit of our briefings just director Lee, the sea cruise has actually compared to 100, the 100 500, and the 300, as well as the 2000, and the 8000 ton, which Chen just explained to some of the advances, so that we may not be too active on the ship, but on the 2000 to the level of the ship, which is really suitable for the Taiwan ship to fight. Next, we answer to the investment friends, what we have to the bottlenecks, how to overcome.

In short, the current order is absolutely not a problem, so if we have a shortage of manpower, we will respond with the order that we have already received from China Airlines and Wanhai orders to assess all the production capacity and manpower needs, as well as the cultivation of talent needs. Well, the title of the QA host, well, the other media friends asked the title of the QA host, and I said to myself, I'm the master of the QA ship, Cai Kunzhong.

This will help us reduce our costs, convert, and shorten our time. That's why we're planning to launch the so-called replacement plan for the next possible shipbuilding ship, and our existing two large crane GOCs. If we build a large ship, we can enlarge the ship section, and then let the ship section to save our time in the future, so that we can improve our own competitiveness.

The company has announced that on March 6, 114, it will be paid back to all creditors. Thanks to our fast financial aunt. Next, we will answer media reporters, some media in Taiwan in the last few years, the order is of course poorly priced, so when is it easier to call a good single? This part of this brief explanation, basically, we ship from one contract to the real ship, about two years, or even four years, even if the photo is just said to have to be, in fact, we are even after next year, mostly this year, most of the year, or in the past, the contract to pay off the bad price, but that ratio has slowed down.

The company's current balance is mainly in accordance with the completion proportion method, so as long as his progress, we will report monthly revenue. The current balance is about 80 billion. At the Kaohsiung plant, our current wanhai ship will be listed until the end of 2030, so if the selection of the pilot will continue to execute until 31 years. The main business of the company is to carry out our 1000 tons cruiser, which is currently scheduled to 116 years, which is October 2027.

Thank you to our Deputy General Manager of the week. Then there are our investors who asked us how many people are on the ship. This part of the explanation is a little, and the ship should all work in the team there are about 2800 people, but we also have the so-called contractors, and the contractor is about 1200 people.

This is not the case. In recent years, as their business volume increases, their people and offices have also expanded, but there is no shortage of manpower. Then there are investment friends who have asked, whether we can extend our IDS prototype port test, whether we can have the relevant node progress, power system, etc. This part we can only say that our HAT and SAT have already said, all of which are according to the nodes and to achieve the phase test security, we will do the next node. But at present, we still have to do the complete planning progress, we are expected to do the so-called aeroplane test in April, the same thing is to maintain our contract deadline, this year November.

I asked the Deputy General Manager of the week to explain. I think the question is quite large, which leads to the global economy and some tariffs. This part is actually for the Taiwan ship. Well, for the time being, we are currently receiving the commercial ship, the problem is not much, because the main raw materials part, our steel plate is mainly from China Steel, not all of our current commercial ships, including business ships, steel plates will not be purchased from the United States, will not be purchased with the mainland China.

I think it's important for us to do this in a country where international trade is not the same as China's. I think it's not possible for us to do this, but it's possible for us to do that in the future. I think it's not possible for us to do that in the future, but it's possible for us to do that in the future.

If we take the basis of the merchant ship and Guoan to consider a certain part, I think we may have to consider how our government can achieve a balance under this balance of interests and interests, on the one hand to stabilize the domestic shipping industry, including the shipbuilding industry, so that our economy can continue to grow. This part also relates to the development of the unmanned ship.

So, I think it's important to use unmanned ships for defense. If that is the case, we're targeting the U.S. recently for a protection or restart of the ship, and I think that the media friends or some investors in the country may be looking at it from a different perspective, not just whether it is profitable, but whether it is profitable, so that it can retain the energy of the ship for a long time.

This part of what we want to say is that the operation of the Taiwan Ship Ring Sea is as optimistic as it is, so there will be a profit, and there will be a 50% profit after the profit will be returned to the Taiwan Ship parent company. But it is not the same value of profit last year, sorry that this is not suitable for our trade secrets to explain to the outside world.

Well, if we don't have a last question, just a media asked our investment friends, and Taiwan Ship Company took a number of Chinese oil company's projects, then ask the estimated profit. This part we briefly explained, the ship took two cases of oil, one is a 26 oil tank package, and the other one is a tank loading and unloading factory called the Dalin Petroleum Oil Storage and Transport Center. The two cases, about $11.2 billion in contract value. The two cases are still in progress, the two cases are still projected to have a so-called profit for Taiwan Ship Company, but because the profitable genes are confidential, so it is not difficult to disclose to the public.

Thank you very much for your participation. We wish you all the best and the investment is smooth, thank you.
