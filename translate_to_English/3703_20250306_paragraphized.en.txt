This is a very familiar area. We are very familiar with this track-related business, which is a market block of the main effort of the mainland project. So we mean that we are able to make further progress in the core market through the three projects we have just mentioned. This is part of the mainland project, which is part of the real estate development business, which is part of the construction of the mainland.

So we have recently acquired a site for the construction of the season in Beitun District, Taichung City, which is the 14th reconstruction area of Taichung. Then we have already had this area before we are now continuing to sell this project. So this time we have made about 1700 square feet, which is next to our current project. So for this area, it will be a very good expansion of a brand building in mainland China.

So, we are also grateful and happy to be able to report that our mainland China construction in New Taipei City has been successfully completed. Then the project we will list later, which will allow us to prepare 52.800 million revenues in 2028. Then the board of directors' recent resolutions have just been explained by the vice president. Then the board of directors decided to allocate $1.05 per share of cash dividends, which is also announced. Then we also announced that our shareholders' conference was held on June 17th.

So we will use our recent financial performance to look at our recent revenue, which will use our revenue inventory to share with you the long-term revenue outlook. So in the construction project, which is the part of the mainland project, at the end of last year, our revenue volume reached a record high of $129 billion. The main reason is just to report to you, we have made a lot of new projects in the field of civil engineering.

So the second is the real estate development business, which is the revenue of China's construction. So we at the end of 2024 billion yuan, which is a record high of China's construction. In the last four quarters of last year, we have increased from the end of 2023, and we have increased the history of the three quarters to the end of 267 billion yuan.

This is the part of China's construction, that is, the environmental engineering and water treatment business, that is, Xinda Huan labor. The revenue of Xinda Huan labor is 647 million yuan. Next, we report on the construction business, that is, we will work on some projects in the next year 2025. So, compared to 2024, because many of our projects are relatively long-term needs to be completed for several years.

This is the main new project of our 2025 work. So this is the new project that we acquired last year, and it will be one of our main projects this year. So this is the part of the mainland project. So in the real estate development business, that is, the part of the real estate project, we will first report to you, and then report to you, the commercial real estate part.

So in the final part of the building, we have a few cases of Paul Poughkeepsie keeping up with us, and that's a lot more sales in the last four cases in 2024 than in 2023. Then any of our home sales can be recognized for profit. So this part is also where we focus on the sale. So the next part of the report with you is the project that we're going to focus on in the next three years. So this is where we're going to end up with a major donation this year, and then we're going to see that we have three major projects in 2025, and 2627 each of them are scheduled to recognize revenues and profits. Then it's after 2028, because the whole of our real estate development business, and we're ready for that profit by 2030 or 2031.

The first is that we have marked the end of the crossing just with you, which is the first point. Then the second point we have also added is that we have just reported the new land in Taichung City on the third line of Beitun District, which is 14th phase of the land. Then we will also follow you after the completion of the planning. Then we are in New Taipei City on the third line of New Taipei City on the third line of the third row of Yong and the mayor of the area, which is very close to the riverside road and very close to the riverside road.

So this is one of our first lines of a combined park that is nearly 100 meters wide on our shores. So this is also the process we will complete after the plan is completed, and then we will exit after the plan is completed. So this is a project we have listed after 2028.

This is one of our projects, which is the way to manage and follow up with reports that if it is an office-related field, it may be a sales or rent, etc. If it is in the hotel, we will let the hotel to operate a relatively stable situation first, then look at the appropriate time to do further sales is more than the real estate development business and mainland China construction, and the next two pages with you to report are environmental engineering and water treatment, that is, the two parts of Xinda Huan labor, the two parts of the current situation is roughly the same as when we follow a quarterly report with you, so I would also invite you to see that we regularly announce the financial figures of our recent performance.

Now let's take a look at this new big ring for us.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user, sorting them into paragraph texts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided text texts in a manner that pays attention to the timestamp and the corresponding sentences.

For example, the first half of the discussion about the operation time of the new Grand Ring Palace, and the second half of the transition to mainland China is affected by real estate control. The content segmentation of these different themes is needed to ensure that each paragraph begins with a central thought. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps, and ensure that the sentence is arranged in the correct order of time. For example, there is an interval between timestamps, such as [1687. 90-1691. 78], which may mean that the speaker pauses or shifts the topic, leaving the appropriate space or segmentation when finishing.

In addition, the user mentioned "New Grand Ring" and "Mainland Building" are two different themes that need to be handled separately. During finishing, it is necessary to ensure that the content of each topic is coherent and not confused. For example, the part of the new Grand Ring should be focused on business direction and operating hours, while the part of the mainland building discusses the impact of real estate control and corporate strategy.

The new Grand Ring will be divided into two sections in this section of the sewage of the people's livelihood. The new Grand Ring will now include the treatment of this regenerative water of the people's livelihood. We also now include the treatment of wastewater of industrial wastewater before us. The treatment of this regenerative water is also in the direction we will plant in the future. In fact, we have just mentioned that we already have the relevant capacity and related cases. The new Grand Ring is the part of the water in this section.

We are now also just asking investors to get our first new case in this field. We are going to start a new phase of operation in the first half of next year. Now, investors are asking whether mainland China is affected by overall real estate control or is it not because of this impact to do any of the changes in the direction of future operations?

That's actually the opportunity to help our customers to get a better land or a better project to plan related products. So competition should be better for many brand builders. So I also think that most of the customers who are based on their own positioning are self-help is less than the purpose of investing in this customer. So I think self-help is a rigid need so it should be relatively stable. So our internal assessment is currently in the development of new projects or proposals should be carried out on schedule according to our established direction.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us by email or phone. Thank you for your participation today. SZMC Online Investor Conference for the fourth quarter of 2024 will conclude here. Thank you for your continued good health investment.
