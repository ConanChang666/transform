<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim texts provided by the user and sort them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided to see how these verbatim sentences separated by time are reorganized into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a record of financial reporting meetings involving the financial situation of the company, market conditions, change in the number of employees, etc. Speakers include the host and the finance general manager Huang Guoyu. The interval of time stamps shows the transformation and segmentation of the speaker's content, but the user wants to remove these timestamps and merge them into a natural paragraph. Next, I need to identify the speaking section of each speaker and merge the sequential sentences of the same speaker into paragraphs. For example, the host introduces the meeting and guests, and then Huang Guoyu begins introducing the financial data.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic, but are separated by timestamps and need to be merged. At the same time, make sure not to miss any sentences, including all the content between timestamps. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as blanks or errors in the timestamp, such as [235. 50-250. 30] I have ê³¡ Mic, where there may be errors, but user requests do not delete anything, so it must be kept as it is.

In addition, some sentences may be duplicated between timestamps, such as "we made 7.1 billion" twice, need to confirm whether it was necessary, but according to the user's requirements, everything must be retained. Then, I need to remove the timestamp, keep only the content of the speech, and merge the continuous speech of the same speaker into paragraphs. For example, Huang Guoyu introduced the section of financial data, it may be necessary to merge multiple timestamped sentences into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the order and content of the original sentence. At the same time, attention to the coherentness of the punctuation of the punctuation and sentence may be required to add appropriate punctuation, but the user requests do not change the content, so the punctuation of the punctuation can only adjust the punctuation of the punctuation. Finally, check the entire passage passage-based punctuation, make sure that all the original sentences are properly preserved, without omissions or error, and the transition between paragraphs, and convert between paragraphs, and in accordance with the order of the speaker's.

After completing these steps, read again to confirm that it meets all the requirements of the user. </think> [paragraph verbatim transcription]: We are now entering our second forum meeting. We are very honored to have invited Wang Zhongwen, the general manager of Lion Travel to come here.

We were so applause, and then we asked our manager, Mr. Huang to tell us about the market and the company. Thank you very much, sir, I am the financial manager of the group. I am happy to have the opportunity to meet you again today, although a lot of it should be gone for a long time.

I'm sorry, we made 7.1 billion in the first quarter. Sorry to let me go to the outside, we made 7.1 billion in the first quarter. That last year, well, that same quarter last year was 5.9 billion. The cost of that year, you can see that the cost rose to about 800 million, that last year was about 700 million. The cost, mainly because last year's profit situation was good, the staff was very hard during the pandemic, so we raised some bonuses, packaged bonuses, so the first quarter was a bit higher.

That is to say, the most important thing is that we have to get the most out of our trip. Sorry to clarify, we have the stock of the stock of that stock, we have the early investment, then we have more than 3000, then the subsidiary has more than 500, and then we take equity law, another trip has more than 1000, so we have a total increase of 5000, so the cost is about 40, this report with you. That's because it will be distributed this year, the affiliate companies are mainly some companies that we invest in, and then the first quarter EPS is 4. 5, 4. 57. That's where we can see that the net interest rate is going up, that we are about three years later, so the overall meeting situation is stronger than before, and that it helps us after the epidemic, in fact, it looks like a relatively normal development.

This is part of our total assets. We pre-paid $71.6 billion and then pre-paid $1.6 billion, and other financial assets are $22 billion, some of which are all over the place, so the total assets are still growing. I think I'll take a quick look at this step, because this should be more obsolete for you. This is our borrowing, short-term borrowing in fact, we've improved a lot from the time of the pandemic, and I think we all know, and then we're working hard to pay off these loans all the way now.

In addition, the contract debt is 3.5 billion, last year was 3.6 billion, so the contract debt means that I first received the money, for example, some people booked the amount to depart in the next few months, that amount is likely to be the part of the deposit in the next three to six months, which is the data from which you can see the overall operation of the next three to six months. Then the other tenancy debts are all we belong to some of our stores or rents, and there is no more special part.

In the past, we may have used a lot of people's tactics before our employees, but then we will do a little bit more, so we will find a lot less people, but in fact, the business won't fall, the profit won't fall, the reason is here. Well, this is just our EY payouts. The breakdown of payments can be seen on our first page, and it's nothing special. So your project is mainly about the benefits of YB exchange, which is Q1, but the exchange rate of Taiwan dollar was not fluctuated by the end of March, but we'll explain how the exchange rate went before us. Well, that's what we did in 2005, we did in the year Q1171 billion, and a few of the following are listed companies, about 7115, so you can see it, no matter whether it's the market size of the bear market is wider, it's, it's a bit a lot, which means that it's a bit different, but the growth, but the bear market value.

If not, that's not the case.
