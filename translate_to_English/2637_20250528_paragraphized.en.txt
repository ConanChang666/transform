<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that the sentences corresponding to each point in time are fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, there are some intervals between the verbs provided by the user, such as [0.0 00-3. 84] to [457. 60-463. 60], and I need to make sure that each sentence corresponds correctly to the corresponding time period. At the same time, it is important to note that there are times when jumps may occur, such as jumping directly to [450. 60-453. 60], and is there any omissions in the middle?

For example, there are several "operational strategies" and "financial information" mentioned in the original text, which need to be kept as it is. Then, I pay attention to the convergence between sentences to ensure that paragraph transitions are natural. For example, when transitioning from corporate governance to financial information, it may be necessary to add some connection words or adjust the sentence structure, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so it can only be achieved by a reasonable chronological order.

Therefore, I need to make sure that the sentences at each point are fully preserved, even if some sentences may appear lengthy or repetitive. In the process, it is also necessary to pay attention to the correctness of the punctuation and formatting. For example, the timestamps and sentences in the original text may require appropriate spaces or line breaks to meet paragraph-based requirements. At the same time, check for typographical or grammatical errors, but the user does not mention the need for proofreading, so it may only be necessary to keep the original.

We are very pleased to welcome Huiyang to our Taishin Forum. We are now giving our time to the management team, thank you very much. Thank you very much for your time, dear friends.

There is an opportunity to communicate with colleagues. Today's main point, we will start with the presentation, and then, of course, we want to have more time to interact with you. But if there is any unclear place in the presentation, or where you want to ask questions, welcome to nothing.

The presentation of today is divided into three parts, the first is about our company, the second is about the industry situation, and the third is the operation strategy. In order to talk about the company's overview, in fact, the production shipping everyone sells almost the same thing, that is, the empty space of the cabin, that is, the freight.

The third is our attention to environmental issues. Of course, it doesn't mean that others don't pay attention to it, which means that we may pay less attention to the direction. We will also use this opportunity, and then we will explain how our company works.

First of all, in the corporate governance section, we have about 50% of the shares we can control, even though the chairman is also the founder of the chairman, but we are currently on the board of directors, and I am the independent director of five of the nine seats. We also try to take into account the expertise of the board of directors, and then the economy and the law, etc. We will do some decentralization. At present, we have two of the nine seats are independent directors of women. In addition, we also attach great importance to the development of our professional team, because basically our trading subjects are almost all foreign customers.

So, for us, although our operations center is located in Taiwan, we are also in a cross-time zone, and then we have the ability to talk directly to different cultures or languages. In particular, sometimes we need to deal with problems, not just customer problems, but also spread if they happen, such as in Africa or anywhere else, often there are situations that need to be addressed.

In addition, we also hope to hold regular legal meetings. In addition to this, legal friends or media friends are also welcome to communicate with each other. If we talk about this financial information, we can share it with you, which is our financial information in 2024. Last year, EBS reached 8.08. Overall, because we are a monthly announcement of the relationship, so it is better to recommend investors to friends, if you want to understand the changes in the company's operation, mainly refer to the OP's MARGIN.

Because we don't have anything to do with our shipping depreciation, interest, crew insurance, and China Post revenue, it's a cost for the crew to stay there. So for OPTION MARGIN, it's probably a sign that you can make an INDICATOR that changes to the market. So it's not always a thing to see, because there are ways to minimize the impact of climate fluctuations on performance when every ship company is working. So, like our shipping company, most of the previous years, probably before 2019, most of us took a fixed rent contract, so OPRATION MARGIN will be very stable.

The tradition is also on the low season, which is usually the worst in February. It's not really good for last year, so it's also reflected on the operation MARGIN. The 2025 is now the month of the month announcement, so the first quarter of the year may be a relatively bad condition, so the results are not ideal. So we started a little bit more in April, so we hope that this season will continue.

If you are looking for a ship with a large number of cargo vessels, you may want to consider a larger size than the larger size of a ship. If you are looking for a larger size than the larger size of a ship, you may want to consider a larger size than the larger size of a ship.

So we usually discuss BDI BDI BDI, which is divided into four categories, and that is what we want to do as a classification, and then let investors make a reference. So if we compare with some of the other bulk shipping companies listed in China, you can see that it is basically based on CAPSIDE PARAMETER in the new domain, which is basically all that can be done in this way, and that the Taiwan Airlines is based on SUPER and PARAMETER in the four dimensions, which is probably the HANDY SMALL ANDY in the four dimensions.

If you are looking for a ship with a fixed lease or a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a year, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a fixed lease for a month, or if you have a new lease for a month, or if you have a new lease for a new lease for a month or a new lease for a month, or if you have a new lease for a new lease for a new lease for a new lease for a new lease for a month, or a new lease for a new lease for a new lease for a new lease? In this case, we believe that we have the opportunity to get a better financial reward in the long run, although it is relatively stable, but the reward is relatively good. Although the market has been up and down in recent years, we basically have been positive in this industry, so we think that the transition between paper and paper to keep the rental contract is not a bad strategy, so it is important that we can do so because we are financially stable now, and this is why we have to take more paper linkage than six years ago. 78% BSI has lost an average of 18.9% on average, which is close to 20% of the drop price. This is reflected in our revenue above the revenue. In fact, we own the fleet in our company's revenue ratio has not been large, and we only have six vessels, and we are all small handy to do. Because in fact, this is a place where investors are curious about why we do business, so we believe that even if we are not a large self-owned fleet, it is useful to talk about it again.

If you are looking for a reliable shipping service, you may be looking for a reliable and reliable shipping solution that will help you get the most out of your business. If you are looking for a reliable shipping service, you may be looking for a reliable shipping service that will help you get the most out of your business. If you are looking for a reliable shipping service, you may be looking for a reliable shipping service that will help you get the most out of your business. If you are looking for a reliable shipping service that will help you get the most out of your business in the future, we will be looking for a reliable shipping service that will help you get the most out of your business.

If you are not familiar with the current situation of U.S. tariffs, then we will talk about the changes in U.S. economic policies. In fact, we think that the changes in U.S. economic policies have been an important issue in the market since the second half of last year, I think that this part should not only be about shipping to U.S., but especially about the financial industry, so I think that this is more curious about the relationship between the two and the first part of the tariffs and the trade war is about China's ship President Trump announced that there is a special Hong Kong tariff service fee, then how will affect the ship we will be able to report soon.

How to decorate? Where do you want to decorate? Can you reduce the impact of tariffs? Right now, I don't know. Only knowing that investing in the United States is probably the most difficult problem, but there are no other costs in the United States. So many of these companies are looking forward to it.

So from the second half of last year, the dynamics of the market have been constant, and some people say that this is not difficult, that even when the index is low, it is basically not that everyone is very active. It may be that this investor said that some of the monthly orders, etc., and we feel that this is not obvious to us.

The shipbuilding industry is a long industry chain that requires upstream resources, machinery and equipment, steel, and its design personnel, and then the equipment is all involved in a lot of professions. So we think that the shipbuilding industry needs time, then the United States can develop this shipbuilding industry from the 24th century to the present very far. So with the current economic situation of the United States, we feel that the United States is not likely to develop its domestic shipbuilding industry in the short term. This is from the point of view of the shipbuilding industry, but if there are other costs for Chinese shipbuilding, it will reduce the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry and then promote the development of other countries.

So we think that this is a part of the future of global shipbuilding industry. In our case, our company's ships are almost made in Japan, some of which are made in Japan, some are made in Japan, some are made in Japan, some are made in Japan, such as Longike Zhoushan, or NUX, which is Nantong's Kawasaki and Sino-Far East joint venture, which we will make in China.

We are talking about an additional concern, which is more of a factor to express, then the price of each boat boat is our confidence June You are going to criticize show traffic normalmente those We do not value Tae! So the actual ddляChinese national All right We do civil other people General How many of us are burdened with your heart, or I am occupying your position, we are responsible for ourselves. Yesterday, the platform had a Lunar New Year, Chinatown, so China's economic vitality is still closely related to bulk shipping, because whether it is steel or infrastructure, China is a large market, so we can not be enough to exclude some uncertainty caused by this part of bulk shipping. But in the context of the trade war, it seems that there is still no way to have a definite optimistic view of China's economic future, so I think it will still have a certain effect on China's still happening.

It is also important to note that there is a need for reconstruction after the end of the war. I think it is not necessarily necessary, so it should be said that rebuilding takes time, it is impossible to say that all the ships in the world are loaded with raw materials, rebars and cement, and this is not possible. So I want to rebuild is a long process, and we believe that the business opportunities in this process are certain, but we have to start the network after the end of the war.

This is a more popular view. That should be said. It is also a slowdown in new shipbuilding investments. So this part is especially put into powder for many years. We feel that the number of new shipbuilding is not so much. This is obvious after the pandemic.

A gap. It's not enough to invest in a new ship for bulkships. But it's been years since the pandemic. We found that some ships may be on. Maybe it was container. Then it was replaced with poker.

There are some changes to the order, so the current order quantity for this new boat is not. Not very few. There is no obvious gap. But because many shipbuilders are also some of the Handy size.

So, we don't think we're going to go over the supply. But that's also a fact. That's especially true of the first high price. The second is to face a lot of environmental uncertainty. So I think it's also an investment in new shipbuilding.

One of the reasons for this is that there are a couple of shipyards, of course there are a lot of other ship owners. In fact, in the last two years, the ship began to enter.

So I think this part of the story. It is also a lot of people who are making new ships. It is an important factor in production because it is something like this. No matter what the economy is, it is all about its needs.

It's still stable. It's not very easy to be affected by a major impact. Except in some global economic turmoil. They certainly affect more. But we think the ship is a sustainable industry.

It will continue. It is not a Western industry. So I think there are some ships that want to enter the ground. This is also a normal thing.

We also have a Cluster table here. You have to make a reference. For example, how is this Dry Bug fixed on? So you'll find it too. It's a good thing before it's released in 2022. There's not much to do in 2022.

Then, in 2023, that number will rise. Then, in 2024, it will drop slightly. That's 25 years. Now, of course, we're still observing. That's a sudden increase after the pandemic. And then, in 2023, that's a downward trend.

It is a bit of a reverse, so I think that's right. That's what the industry is doing mainly according to our different indices, and then share it with you. The spread over the last four years has happened.

The first one is BCI such a capsize. Its volatility is the biggest. It is high when it is high. When it is low, it is sometimes the lowest.

That's what this ship represents. It's more volatile. It's also because CAPSIZE is basically just iron ore sand and coalification. It's more concentrated in the goods. So it's related to the shipping company's strategy.

Most of the industry is the smoothest. That said, in the last few years of the market. You can see that the second half of 2021 is actually quite high. The first half of 24 is also good. About the end of the 23rd to the first half of 24.

It's all good now. That's all. The trend of this period is relatively low. But even if it's low, it's not even worse than the period of 22/23. So we think the current market situation is worse.

It may be a bad thing, but it's not a bad thing, it's not a bad thing, it's not a bad thing, it's a bad thing, it's a long-term trend.

We see the price now. The space above is certainly there. Then we are following the BDI of the past few years. Let's do a share. We do a share of the main thing we do.

The first is that the vessel type is seasonal. Most of the time. February is relatively low. Then, August. Most of the time it falls down.

The first is loose shipping with seasonality. His seasonality is actually related to all of you're capital. It's a bit like that.

The market is relatively low during holidays. Therefore, Chinese year and summer holidays are not good. Why is Christmas not good?

So, this is the summer vacation, everyone is on vacation, generally speaking, is better, time is also better, that means that the year is not enough.

Low season is not bad, so we think low season is not good, often a good phenomenon, so in 2021, it is clear that this situation is not going to fall.

This is a special case. So this is a loose shipping. It's OK. Then Paramax is balanced. Then SUPERMAX is balanced. Then CAPSIZE is older.

And then there were more of this old man from Handyside, so we thought it was a big deal.

The ship is ready to be replaced in the future. Then the ship is ready to be put in the future. Of course, this year will be a little different, so we can't say.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request, sorting out the provided verbatim into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the meaning and context of each sentence. The user specifically emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order and maintains the integrity of each sentence.

First of all, I check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp to see if there are duplicates or places that need to be merged. For example, the verbs provided by the user have duplicated "not very much" and "21 or 28 years", which may need to be retained in the same way, but need to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph. Next, I group the sentences according to semantic and logical relationships, forming a natural paragraph. For example, the parts about ship elimination and future forecasting may need to be merged into a paragraph, while the parts about environmental regulations can be separated.

In addition, the "capite" and "pionance" mentioned by the user may be a misspelling or term that needs to be retained as is, without modification. During the processing process, I will check every step to make sure that nothing is missing. For example, the user mentions "project operation is not a bad thing", where it may be necessary to confirm whether it is a "project operation", but according to the user's request, can not be rewritten, so keep it as it is.

In addition, note that the format of the timestamp is correct, such as "[2062. 60-2063. 60]" corresponds to the correct sentences. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph verbatim to ensure smoothness and logicalness while strictly complying with the user's requirements, without adding any additional content or modifying the original text. If there are uncertain places, such as certain terms or duplicate sentences, it will remain the same to ensure that the user's needs are met.

But basically this is the last few years, face the elimination, this is the next few years, do not pass, this people also see. So we can use this table, about the general reference, say different boat types around the world, the future of the process behavior. So overall, we are more optimistic, because we feel that this process is not very healthy. OK, next time this is a small change in the amount of ships, usually this is seen from the outside numbers.

So, I think this other boat type, I think, is a combination of the sea, these two ships, the recent investment, we just saw this, we have a lot of handy, because we think the operation is not a bad thing. That is, we just talked about this boat for more than 20 years, more than 20 years of the ship through the proportion of the ship to the proportion of the new ship, do a picture. Then you see that sometimes, the red line above, that means more healthy. If there are too many attacks on the blue line, like in 2015, then the market is really bad, so the whole fell down.

So now we see, the supply demand of the future, from the number, is relatively balanced, there is no big gap. This is also a reference for everyone, is a few ships added every year, then this scratch dropped a few ships, then the other, basically the ship is still increasing, but you see, YY increased quite stable, then we think this thing, the global demand for this increase, the trade demand, basically can support the growth of about 3% of this temperature, then the next release of this consortium, this is also for you to do a reference, mainly a bit of information.

The above is about the overall supply and demand of the ship, so we will take a little time to introduce the overall situation of the shipping industry. The shipping industry or bulk shipping, in fact, the whole shipping, if we are a bulk shipping company, we are going to talk about loose, to face some regulatory requirements. That is because the ship is considered to be a big source of pollution by the people, we personally think it is very fair, because the cargo volume of the ship is large, so in terms of the efficiency of carrying the cargo, we think it is definitely much higher than what kind of train aircraft.

Then again, there is emissions, so we have to talk about drip oil or to install a trawler, these things, and then the latest things are mainly carbon emissions, carbon emissions this thing because of course talk about greenhouse gases this, greenhouse effect this thing for a long time, with the problem of oil cooling, but carbon is basically as long as the chemical fuel will be, so the process is relatively slow, but this year we have seen more and more of the relevant regulations are carbon emissions, so we also have the opportunity to share them simply.

[2408. 60-2410. 60] What other ways to achieve a good carbon value other than new boats? [2410. 60-2412. 60] This is when EDI is a design, it is when the design should take into account the carbon value. [2412. 60-2415. 60] Also, EXI is to enter the existing vessel and when entering the existing vessel, it is also necessary to take into account the carbon value. [2415. 60-2416. 60] That is to say, the carbon value should be considered from the design stage.

[2416. 60-2418. 60] This is a retroactive smear rule, what is called retroactive smear? [2418. 60-2419. 60] What is called retroactive smear? It is usually in compliance with this environmental rule when a new vehicle is produced. [2419. 60-2421. 60] When a new car is produced, you usually have to comply with this environmental protection rule, which is not smeared, and you sell it. [2421. 60-2422. 60] But what if you have the old boat to follow the rules? [2422. 60-2423. 60] If it is not smeared, you will sell it.

[2423. 60-2426. 60] What should you do if the old boat is also required? [2426. 60-2428. 60] What should you do if the old boat is also required? [2428. 60-2429. 60] What should you do? Can you run if you don't meet the requirements? [2429. 60-2431. 60] Can you run if you don't meet the requirements?

[2431. 60-2432. 60] What can I do? In the words of the ship, this is possible. [2432. 60-2434. 60] In the words of the ship, this is possible, its practice is. [2434. 60-2435. 60] It is the practice of this is that you do not meet the requirements, you are going to reduce it to a certain emission value. [2435. 60-2436. 60] The easiest way to reduce it is to reduce it to a certain emission value. [2436. 60-2438]

[2448. 60-2441. 60] is a slow pace, simply speaking, a little slower. [2441. 60-2442. 60] is a little slower, so if it is a car speaking. [2442. 60-2446. 60] If it is a car speaking, we may not be able to open the speed limit to 5 km, to 80 km, to 60 km, for example. [2446. 60-2450. 60] For example, the car speaking may not be the same, because there will be these speed and safety problems. [2450. 60-2451. 60] Because there will be these limitations and safety problems, speaking of the ship speaking. [2441. 60-2453. 60] When speaking of the ship, it is slow to open most of the action.

[2453. 60-2454. 60] Slowly open most of the action does not matter, so the Engine Output Regulation, such a slowdown. [2454. 60-2455. 60] This slowdown is a very common method of carbon reduction. [2455. 60-2456. 60] This is a very common method of carbon reduction, in addition to saving fuel and carbon reduction. [2456. 60-2458. 60] In addition to saving fuel, it is to add something that is nothing. [2458. 60-2441. 60] The other thing is to install something that is not, such as paint windsurfing. [2451. 60-2462. 60] This can also achieve the effect of carbon reduction.

[2462. 60-2465. 60] It can also achieve carbon reduction effect, and then this is Carbon Intensity Indicator. [2465. 60-2468. 60] This Carbon Intensity Indicator, which is also a view of the operation of the vessel. [2468. 60-2470. 60] It is also a view of the operation of the vessel, the result of the actual operation of the operation. [2470. 60-2472. 60] See the results of the actual operation, in terms of the load. [2472. 60-2474. 60] There is no environmental protection in terms of the volume. [2474. 60-2477. 60] There is not enough load efficiency because I just said.

[2477. 60-2478. 60] Because I just said, wow, the ship is loaded with tens of thousands of tons. [2478. 60-2480. 60] If a ship is, it emits as much carbon. [2480. 60-2482. 60] But it is poor in every load, not tens of thousands of tons. [2482. 60-2483. 60] There are hundreds of tons, what to do?

[2488. 60-2490. 60] is not good because we think it is. [2490. 60-2491. 60] This is a start. [2491. 60-2495. 60] may slowly transform into something else. [2495. 60-2450. 60] And it is not obvious because of its economic incentives above the influence. [2500. 60-2502. 60] No fines etc. [2502. 60-2504. 60] This is the plan you want to improve.

[2504. 60-2506. 60] What is not possible to improve the plan. [2506. 60-2507. 60] is not clear at the moment. [2507. 60-2510. 60] So we think that CII is a stipulation. [2510. 60-2512. 60] is not an effective measure. [2512. 60-2514. 60] In fact, the ship's regulations are basically this. [2514. 60-2516. 60] It is sometimes not confident at first.

[2516. 60-2519. 60] But because it paved the way for the next stage. [2519. 60-2522. 60] So this is the situation of CII. [2522. 60-2524. 60] The more specific is the European Union. [2524. 60-2526. 60] The environmental protection is always the limit. [2526. 60-2528. 60] The specificity is that it now has to push carbon tax on ships. [2528. 60-2531. 60] Carbon tax is not new in the EU.

[2531. 60-2533. 60] But I would not have come to teach the ship before. [2533. 60-2535. 60] Because the ship runs everywhere, you can't say that I'm a European ship. [2535. 60-2537. 60] But what they're doing now is [2537. 60-2539. 60] I'm taxed regardless of whether you're coming to Europe. [2539. 60-2541. 60] So if you're in Europe, you're in Europe. [2541. 60-2543. 60]

[2543. 60-2544. 60] The course is 100%. [2544. 60-2546. 60] You begin. [2546. 60-2548. 60] You never come to the European port from the European port. [2548. 60-2550. 60] Or from Europe to the rest of the world. [2550. 60-2552. 60] 50% of the course. [2552. 60-2553. 60]

[2553. 60-2556. 60] So this is a timeframe for the European Union's carbon tax approximately. [2556. 60-2558. 60] From 2024. [2558. 60-2560. 60] Starting last year. [2560. 60-2562. 60] Then this year we should be ready to collect it. [2562. 60-2564. 60] So we think the EU's carbon tax [2564. 60-2566. 60] This is actually the case.

[2566. 60-2568. 60] A simple way to understand. [2568. 60-2570. 60] is to treat it as a fuel surcharge. [2570. 60-2572. 60] How much it actually affects it. [2572. 60-2574. 60] In fact, it is based on 2025 data. [2574. 60-2576. 60] is probably fuel. [2576. 60-2578. 60] If you want to go to Europe.

[2578. 60-2580. 60] The fuel cost will be 28 percent more. [2580. 60-2582. 60] It is not very expensive. [2582. 60-2584. 60] We think it is also good. [2584. 60-2586. 60] So there may be some economic shocks. [2586. 60-2588. 60] But it is less than that. [2588. 60-2590. 60] It is impossible to say that it is impossible to bear.

[2590. 60-2592. 60] This is a surcharge. [2592. 60-2594. 60] So it will not affect the European Union after that. [2594. 60-2596. 60] The price level will have an impact. [2596. 60-2598. 60] Of course we are still observing. [2598. 60-2600. 60] But we are talking about it. [2600. 60-2602. 60] It is actually a very simple thing.

[2602. 60-2604. 60] is money. [2604. 60-2606. 60] This is different. [2606. 60-2608. 60] It is a little more complex than the Fuel EU. [2608. 60-2610. 60] Fuel EU its concept is to encourage tradition. [2610. 60-2612. 60] Other alternative fuels are used. [2612. 60-2614. 60] It replaces alternative fuels.

[2614. 60-2616. 60] It is to be said. [2616. 60-2618. 60] It is to be seen directly. [2618. 60-2620. 60] It is to be said that this emission is yours. [2620. 60-2622. 60] The intensity of Greenhouse Gas. [2622. 60-2624. 60] It is not to be said that this condition is more complex. [2624. 60-2626. 60] The calculation of this intensity is more complex.

[2626. 60-2628. 60] So that. [2628. 60-2630. 60] It will. [2630. 60-2632. 60] It will count your fuel. [2632. 60-2634. 60] From the extraction to the end. [2634. 60-2636. 60] Total amount of our energy consumption. [2636. 60-2638. 60] Calculate your energy efficiency.

[2638. 60-2640. 60] If you don't, you'll have to pay for it. [2640. 60-2642. 60] The current practice is. [2642. 60-2644. 60] You can use Potential Fuel. [2644. 60-2646. 60] Or do Poly with your family. [2646. 60-2648. 60] It's a little more complicated. [2648. 60-2650. 60] It's because there is no simple way to say it.

[2650. 60-2652. 60] I'm going to add a ton of oil now. [2652. 60-2654. 60] Because you might say. [2654. 60-2656. 60] I'm burning traditionally from March to March. [2656. 60-2658. 60] It's a fossil fuel. [2658. 60-2660. 60] I'm burning on Friday and June. [2660. 60-2662. 60] I'm burning on Friday.

[2662. 60-2664. 60] My year-round density decreases. [2664. 60-2666. 60] It is not possible. [2666. 60-2668. 60] It is possible. [2668. 60-2670. 60] It does not follow you to carbon. [2672. 60-2674. 60] It is as long as you reach a level.

[2674. 60-2676. 60] is not fined. [2676. 60-2678. 60] So this thing is actually in the tradition and pigs. [2678. 60-2680. 60] How to deal with this problem. [2680. 60-2682. 60] causes some uncertainty. [2682. 60-2684. 60] But overall speaking. [2684. 60-2686. 60] Economic point of view. [2684. 60-2686. 60]

[2686. 60-2688. 60] It is Petalogy. [2688. 60-2690. 60] It now looks about. [2690. 60-2692. 60] You want to be about 10%. [2692. 60-2694. 60] It is not very high. [2694. 60-2696. 60] It is probably like this. [2696. 60-2698. 60] But it does not necessarily happen.

[2698. 60-2700. 60] It looks at your year-round operation. [2700. 60-2702. 60] It is a bit more complex. [2702. 60-2704. 60] It is a recent one. [2704. 60-2706. 60] There is also a new requirement for IMO. [2706. 60-2708. 60] It is also complex. [2708. 60-2710. 60] So it is more complicated.

[2710. 60-2712. 60] For the whole view of the words. [2712. 60-2714. 60] We feel this is a requirement of aviation security.

So, if you already know the situation, it will be easier. So, I think this is probably the case, but to say that the new regulations will not greatly impact the ship, I think, but will not, but will encourage the new specifications of the ship to be developed. So, there should be an incentive for technological innovation, but for the ready-made ship, we think it will be a big impact, whether it will increase the operating costs, but the operating costs will not be one that can drive people out of the market.

So we sold four ships in 2024, and now we know how many, and now we are ready to sell four, and then we can see that 2020 is the whole year, 2025 is now May, so we feel that the overall speaking, 2025 the level of buying and selling, I think it will be a little bit more than 2024. So in 2025, although the overall price level of our entire market, it is very much lost, but in fact, the price of second-hand ships is still stable, so we think that we are talking about the disposal of these ships now, it is not a good thing for the company to be able to make money, so basically we think that through this, we can increase the environmental efficiency of our entire fleet, and then increase the competitiveness.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into a consistent paragraph while retaining the original order and content.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic or conversation, and other sentences may belong to different topics, which need to be handled separately. First, I will check each entry in a row to determine the logical relationship between them. For example, the beginning of the "bad", "if I have another problem", "that I'll bother you again" may belong to the same paragraph, because they are all open or polite. Next, "first", "for our announcement", "disposal's calculation of this profit" may belong to the same topic, discussing the issue of the announcement and profit calculation. Then, I will deal with the part of the board announcement, from "so this case announcement" to "so it is possible", these sentences explain the possibility after the announcement, and the possibility of the announcement should be merged into a paragraph.

The following is the question of the premium of the new and used ships, from "the next word" to "I have no way", which involves market analysis and corporate strategy, which needs to be integrated into the paragraph. Finally, on the part of the market outlook and liability strategy, from "so there is no way to clearly tell you what the situation is" to "this is my feeling", these content involves future forecasting and corporate financial strategy, should be segmented. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, to ensure that the transition between the paragraphs is natural, without missing any sentences.

In addition, pay attention to the oral expression, such as "hm", "oh", etc., to keep the original tone. Finally, check whether the entire paragraph typed text is smooth, conform to the requirements of the user, to ensure that there are no omissions or errors.

The first is the announcement of our board of directors, after the board of directors passed the case, we will announce it. So after the announcement of this case, the contract is not necessarily, and then, so his announcement is not a local, simple, so it is possible. So it is possible that the announcement of the board of directors is not executed successfully, so it is possible that we write here, if you see your number is not registered, it means that there is a contract and has been handed over.

The first stage is that we want to cooperate with this transaction, we will announce, and do the first board announcement. Then the second stage is signed, this is not announcement, but here in the local, this case is basically fixed, because there is no contract contract, the other side of the run we can't get along with this deposit, so if there is a contract, the other side of the run we can at least pay him the deposit. So basically in the second stage, we can say that this should be sufficient. The third stage is the transfer, because after the contract is completed, it will not be sold immediately, but also wait for the spread, such as opening two months or three months, and then the transfer, so it is the third stage.

That's what you just said, don't ask me this 1100 million before I add, I'll ask, ah.

23 May [is] the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by his might, and by his might, and by his might, and by his might, and by his might, and by his might, and by his might.

That is, it is currently possible to drop 4.3 in May. It is currently determined that the spread is 3, that is, 3, that is, 3, that is, 3, that of April.

Then, after three days, we were curious because in January, we were less than 30 million MV, so it was based on the above, that's the other two.

Another 2 words. 3 words. That is, each group is one. That is to say, these 4 words are the 1 January. The 3 we have talked about in May. A total of 4 such words.

Then because we have another announcement on May 23, it is because it is connected in May. May 23 announcement. That is. Not yet July.

So if the law is still in place, it will be counted again. But because it is not there, it is not a local one. It is not placed on the upper court of the French Chamber of Commerce. It is frank.

There is no such thing as a debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor or debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor's debtor.

That is, until June. For example, the last third business day. We. You should be able to see. There is a portion of the benefit of this traditional trade. It goes to the direct report in May.

Ask how many people there are in the Red Sea today, no one dares to do it, no one is going to do it, no one is going to do it, no one's going to do it, no one's going to do it, no one's going to do it, no one's going to do it, no one's going to do it, no one's going to do it.

The most common question to ask is that Russia can't go. The Red Sea is a part of the Red Sea. We are a part of the Red Sea, so we don't think it's safe right now. We're probably not the first one in this regard. It's probably only when a lot of people go.

Because this is a risk control problem. Our company is of this scale. There is no need to rush this thing. So the Red Sea part of us will not go so fast. But in the present case, we understand whether or not it is dangerous.

Our rental family is not in line with ours. We have less supervisors across. Instead, it is Russia compared. There are some. There are others who want to go. There are others.

Please, ask the oil price for us. The sensitivity of the impact of the cost. Probably not the average of this number of hours. If so, if so, if so, if so, if so, of a change in its dollar.

We do not have any tags for We Are The Oilers [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics.

We all give to the renter. So the oil price is paid by the renter. So overall, the oil price represents the proportion of our revenue. It is likely that 4% to 5%. 5% is now 0.7.

Recently this month. But it's only 5% or less. So we have very little impact on oil prices. Because we've already owned more than one, we'll increase the proportion of oil prices. Now we're talking about only six.

So the price of oil fluctuates a lot, so we don't have much impact. And the experience of the past. If the oil price fluctuates, then the price of oil fluctuates.

Most of us can pass on to the shipping fee above. So the oil price is high. Bulk shipping company is bad. We are OK. We are not like container or airline. They still have time to eat their own blood pressure.

Most of us are not afraid of the truth, and we are not afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor are we afraid of the truth, nor of the truth.

We are not afraid of them; we are afraid of them; we are afraid of them.
