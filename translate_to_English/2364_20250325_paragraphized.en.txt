<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and convert it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragment provided to see how to reorganize the timestamp and content into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, there are multiple timestamps in a script that corresponds to a sentence. My task is to sort these sentences in logical order to form a natural paragraph while retaining everything. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic or to the speech of the same speaker, and should be merged together. For example, the greetings and welcome words at the beginning should be joined together, and the introduction of the part of the attendees also needs to be integrated.

Then, starting with [34. 40-37. 40], there may be another subject, such as agenda arrangement or company profile, that needs to continue segmentation. At the same time, pay attention to the transition of the spokesperson. For example, the beginning part of [52. 40-54. 40] may be further explained by another spokesperson, who may need to clearly distinguish between different speakers and may be represented by line shifting or shrinking in.

In addition, some sentences may repeat or have timestamp errors, such as [468. 40-469. 40] and [469. 40-470. 40] duplicated the same content, need to confirm whether it is a typographical error, but according to the user's request, can not be deleted or modified, so it is necessary to retain the original. In the process, also pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure the transition between paragraphs naturally. For example, when the timestamp has a jump, it may indicate the change of the speaker's transition or subject, which needs to be appropriately segmented. At the same time, keeping the sequence of sentences within each paragraph consistent with the original transcript, avoiding the original sequence of time. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read the entire paragraph procedural text to check whether all sentences are properly preserved without omissions or error.

If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to verify the original data again to ensure the accuracy of the conversion. </think> [paragraph verbatim transcription]: Hello guys, welcome to the symposium of today's Leifei Computer Lab. We are still invited to talk to Lai Ling Kang, the management team of Leifei Computer, and Mr. Yu Guohuan, and will explain the operation, finance and business related information at the meeting.

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the chief executive of the meeting, the first general manager of the meeting, welcome the second director of the general manager of the meeting, and welcome the two. Next to the general manager and the director of the meeting for us to explain, thank you. Dear comrades, the first part of the meeting will be explained by me from the beginning of the season.

In addition, the company's production is determined to be in the Daai Industrial Zone of Kaohsiung, where the total number of employees of the group as at the end of February was 260 people. The company's revenue increased in response to the demand for operation and performance growth, and the total number of employees at the end of October last year was 260 people, and until the end of February has increased to 216 people. The main product is military official rugged laptop computers and military general related accessories.

The company is mainly responsible for the distribution of DuraBook products in mainland China, and then the company is a waste computer Kunshan company, the current Kunshan factory is leased, in order to collect a stable rental income as the main business. The next is the operational overview of the core business introduction and the focus of the brand development, will be explained by the general manager of the company for you.

The first is the military imitation, the second is public safety, that public safety is included in the police, fire forces and ambulances, and next is the dangerous industry, the dangerous industry is basically said to be natural gas, oil, mining, food processing, in fact, it has a lot of dust, so it is a very dangerous place, so this is an important application scene, so the last is a retail service, including said Custom and Facing is the store is part of the warehouse and the back of the warehouse, probably will use a solid mobile device.

The last one is to further increase the visibility of the product. I think it will bring more opportunities to the project, and it will also increase your chances of winning in the middle of the project, so we will continue to invest in marketing resources and further improve the local brand awareness. Well, thanks. The next is about the proportion of product revenue, the company made the first military scale in 2000, the company made the first military scale, the company made the first military scale in 2000, the military specifications of the laptop, and the brand DuraBook.

The final green block can be seen in 8% to 9%, which is just mentioned by the director, we still have customers partners, is Odf accessories and other space income. The next part is about regional revenue comparison, can see the proportion of European revenue, European revenue is part of the red part, that is, there is a significant increase, in fact, mainly in the military defense, because the 5.23 revenue ratio is a significant increase, and the new budget increase in national defense, through the war and the following war continues, geopolitical and regional conflicts continue to rise, as well as the EU NATO countries have extended the military and defense industry-related budgets.

This is the part of the Asia region, the green part of the region, can be seen that China's domestic demand continues to decline, the results in the industrial market are not as expected, so in 2024, the proportion of sales in Asia is also decreasing, the proportion is about 14%. So now we look at the Asian region's goods, the amount and data can also be based on last quarter's financial report. Next is the financial report, first of all, we can first explain the recent consolidated revenue portion of the past three years, the company's consolidated revenue in 2024 was 12.5 million yuan, the company's combined revenue in 2024 saw a significant increase in brand awareness and marketing efforts in the last two years.

So what is the current situation of goods? The next section is about the merger of the standard table, and the consolidated revenue portion has just recently been the presentation of the recently consolidated revenue, here is no longer to say. Here you can see the section on the last year's operating gross profit and operating gross profit, see last quarter last year's operating gross profit performance and the previous quarter and the final year's performance is more and more inferior, mainly because the last quarter has a good response, so some of the machines required to ship the national government's bill are the basic specifications.

This is the fourth quarter of last year's operating expenses, you can see that the fourth quarter of last year's operating expenses also increased by about 158 million, an increase of about 18.4 percentage points, the main reason is that the fourth quarter of the year we have to increase in response to the future of foreign exchange, the salary of employees and the development of operation and growth, so we just mentioned that the number of people we have to change from 100 to more than 200, so this part of the personnel costs also increased compared to the previous year.

The last four quarters of the total tax is an average of 3.081 million. It is the year of the combined loss price and the increase of the year, which can see the year last year's combined annual revenue increase of 1.85 million, which is the main reason is because our brand continues to grow, promote, decline, and participate in a number of related exhibitions in Europe and Europe, so it is said that successful investment in many new markets and new dealers, and there are also many benefits associated with regional political conflicts.

In addition, the balance sheet part of 2024, in the asset part can be seen at the end of 2024, the equity assets about 1.48.27 million, of which the cash portion of the cash on arrival month has reached 4,029 million, which is increased by 1,253 million from the same period last year, can be seen from the cash flow statement of the earnings, mainly because this is the main reason that our industry activity is caused by near cash flow, which can show that the growth of business profits in the industry can lead to healthy cash flow. The stock balance can be seen in the stock balance balance, the stock balance portion, the stock balance part is increased from the same period last year, which is mainly due to this January shipment, so you can actually see that this year's coal revenue in January is about 1, compared to January 2024, so we increased by 55% from the same period of January, so the relevant inventory is due to the shipment in January.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. [1108. 02-1109. 80] Short-term borrowing part. [1109. 80-1111. 86] is currently 4165 million. [1111. 86-1114. 42] This can see the short-term borrowing part. [1114. 42-1118. 00] Also reduced by about 87 million compared to the same period of the previous year. [1118. 00-1120. 56] This is mainly because of the company.

[1120. 56-1124. 90] The state of operations in the industry is growing steadily. [1124. 90-1127. 22] Therefore, the Company uses the trading currency part to try to increase the condition of liabilities. [1127. 26-1132. 90] To reduce the amount of borrowing and strive to reduce the relevant debt ratio. [1132. 90-1134. 18] The other part of the equity. [1134. 18-1137. 50] The consolidated interest is 59286 million. [1137. 50-1139. 80] belongs to the owners of the company.

[1139. 80-1141. 60] is the portion of the Company. [1141. 60-1144. 92] is about 625 million. [1144. 92-1148. 50] can be called the increase in the same period of the previous year by 16831 million. [1148. 50-1151. 58] In fact, the increase in the interests of the Company's owners is also the value of the steady profit made in the industry in 2020. [1156. 70-1156. 82] So the net profit for the Company as of the end of 2024 was $15. 12.

[1161. 82-1162. 84] above. [1166. 68-1168. 98] Thanks to the General Manager and the Registrar for the explanation. [1168. 98-1171. 30] Next, ask questions and exchange time. [1171. 30-1172. 82] Welcome to raise your hand. [1172. 82-1173. 60] Thank you. [1186. 90] [1216. 70-1220. 70] I will ship this part to my customers this year.

[1220. 70-1221. 70] above. [1223. 70-1226. 70] This amount if it is converted into a lot order amount. [1226. 70-1228. 70] How can it be converted. [1228. 70-1233. 70] That is, there are hundreds of billions of such lot orders. [1234. 70-1238. 70] What can you do?

[1238. 70-1241. 70] Your counterargument is still what to say. [1241. 70-1245. 70] Because it is actually the portion of the prepayment we receive. [1245. 70-1247. 70] is not a fixed synthesis. [1247. 70-1249. 70] may be 20% 40%. [1249. 70-1252. 70] is the portion of the client expects to make an order. [1252. 70-1256. 70] will give them some of the deposit after we negotiate.

[1256. 70-1258. 70] So you say in the hand order part. [1258. 70-1261. 70] He has the ability to reverse the current amount. [1261. 70-1264. 70] It can be said that now in the hand order. [1266. 70-1269. 70] This part may not be available. [1271. 70-1272. 70] The above description. [1275. 70-1284. 70] Because now 85% is NB and tablet.

[1284. 70-1287. 70] The proportion is long and solid. [1287. 70-1291. 70] For we are now long and semi-long solids of two tablets. [1291 70-1295. 70] You can see how I am a half-long laptop. [1295. 70-1298. 70] So in fact, we are long and semi-long solids. [1298. 70-1302. 70] This is the part that we continue to roll out. [1302. 70-1305. 70] The 92% of what you say is only 10%.

[1305. 70-1308. 70] is a semi-long solid and long solid part. [1308. 70-1311. 70] We have not made a consumption pattern. [1311. 70-1313. 70] There are only some very star. [131313. 70-1315. 708% of the OEM foundry. [1315. 70-1321. 70] is a peripheral part of such a provision. [1321. 70-1321. 70] And the gross profit is also relatively low.

[1322. 70-1326. 70] So we try to develop above the free platform. [1326. 70-1327. 70] Ask about that. [1327. 70-1329. 70] Because the ratio is already very high. [1329. 70-1333. 70] So the future growth in gross profit margin will be relatively limited. [1333. 70-1334. 70] That is. [1334. 70-1335. 70] I can.

[1335. 70-1339. 70] It can be done with a current gross profit margin of about 35% to 40%. [1339. 70-1345. 70] The gross profit margin of our long-solid computer is about 35% to 45% of this range. [1345. 70-1348. 70] The future is that if the weight will not be too large, the whole gross profit margin will be increased. [1348. 70-1351. 70] There is also a possibility that the whole gross profit margin will be increased. [1351. 70-1354. 70] Or what are the costs or other factors. [1354. 70-1357. 70] This can make this gross profit margin go up.

[1357. 70-1362. 70] It is said that we will try to maintain the current gross profit margin as this change. [1362. 70-13664. 70] Like many people know before it is possible. [1364. 70-1366. 70] About some key components. [1366. 70-1367. 70] Like the memory part. [1367. 70-137.2. 70] Also soared and now. [1370. 70-137.2. 70] So we will evaluate it.

[1372. 70-1375. 70] If some memory component or critical component is at a price increase. [1375. 70-1379. 70] We sell too much to do some control costs. [1379. 70-1383. 70] That is, of course, our goal is to maintain gross profit margin. [1383. 70-1385. 70] The current gross profit margin is based on the current gross profit margin. [1385. 70-1388. 70] The zero to the future soaring part. [1388. 70-1389. 70] This we cannot predict.

[1389. 70-1393. 70] Because some things are actually the value that guests can accept. [1393. 70-1396. 70] And we have some parts that belong to the soaring part belongs to a large amount. [1396. 70-1398. 70] Of course the house is relatively low. [1398. 70-1403. 70] This is not a way to do such a so-called control. [1403. 70-1406. 70] We can only try to control how we reduce our costs. [1406. 70-1408. 70] To maintain such gross margins.

[1418. 70-1413. 70] That's what it's like to see the current soaring and retailing ratio. [1413. 70-1417. 70] Soaring and retailing ratio. [1417. 70-1421. 70] I'm about six percent soaring. [1421. 70-1422. 70] Sixty percent soaring. [1423. 70-1424. 70] Is that the same as last year? [1424. 70-1425. 70]

[1425. 70-1426. 70] Also this year. [1426. 70-1429. 70] This year is expected to be almost the same. [1433. 70-1443. 70] Please note that the general statement that the round with recovery in the prepayment part should be retail. [1443. 70-1448. 70] The soaring part can also be paid in advance. [1448. 70-1450. 70] This is our business model. [1450. 70-1453. 70] In fact, it should have several possibilities.

[1463. 70-1455. 70] A type is a soaring prepayment. [1455. 70-1461. 70] Some of it is that retail they ask for priority payments. [1461. 70-1463. 70] Because that is the end of the year. [1463. 70-1468. 70] So it may not exactly match the time it paid for shipping. [1468. 70-1447. 70] Because if it is retail, we do not let creditor. [1463. 70-1475. 70] So your money must be received first.

[1475. 70-1478. 70] If it has a gap with your regular shipments. [1478. 70-1482. 70] Whether it is due to the relationship of the season or the delivery time. [1482. 70-1485. 70] That will always appear in the hand. [1485. 70-1487. 70] We soar. [1487. 70-1489. 70] So we can say it is a combination. [1489. 70-1490. 70] It is not an agent.

[1490. 70-1493. 70] Soaring can also receive cash advances. [1493. 70-1494. 70] Of course. [1499. 70-1502. 70] This is a case that has been soared and we'll ship it later. [1502. 70-1504. 70] Yes. [1504. 70-1508. 70] It is probably based on our past experience. [1508. 70-1512. 70] The amount of lintime that can be soared to the shipment is probably how much.

[1512. 70-1518. 70] In fact, it is very difficult to get a general view. [1518. 70-1522. 70] It is a short two or three months that you rush to the two or three fasts. [1522. 70-1527. 70] We have encountered the type of drag to the ten months. [1527. 70-1532. 70] So it is really important to look at the nature of that surge. [1533. 70-1536. 70] Think about asking yourself if you just said that first. [1536. 70-1541. 70] If this shipment is longer than ten months for us, it is not very long.

[1541. 70-1542. 70] or [1542. 70-1547. 30] The ten-month period is considered to be short within a year. [1547. 30-1548. 30] But it says. [1548. 30-1551. 20] I just meant to say. [1551. 20-1554. 20] I should just explain that I don't really know. [1554. 20-1557. 20] Is what we start from.

[1557. 20-1559. 20] If you start the target from that target. [1559. 20-1562. 20] When it ends, it will be fast for ten months. [1563. 70-1568. 20] But if it has already fallen from your target. [1568. 20-1571. 20] After ten months, it will be slow for exports. [1572. 70-1578. 70] Please ask for the mention of the report here.

[1581. 70-1584. 70] After 2024, the page is 2.5. [1584. 70-1587. 70] Because I look at the number 2.83. [1587. 70-1591. 70] Here it looks like growth in the industry. [1591-1595. 70] Actually, it's not much faster than the range outside of this page. [1595. 70-1599. 70] So I don't know what your page is about. [1599. 70-1601. 70]

[1601 70-1602. 70] The outer part of the page is followed. [1602. 70-1607. 70] What you refer to is about rental income and exchange benefit. [1602. 70-1610. 70] You are saying that there is a 2.83 after deducting. [1610. 70-1612. 70] It is your business interest. [1612. 70-1615. 70] Converts the net profit to the business. [1615. 70-1618. 70] Because most of it may be the business profit.

[1618. 70-1621. 70] Operating net profit is not a benchmark for investing in flat houses. [1621. 70-1622. 70] It is a year of maintenance. [1622. 70-1623. 70] Does not necessarily grow. [1623. 70-1627. 70] Your net profit has not increased by 17.8 years. [1627. 70-1628. 70] Well, that is, I want to go back and ask a simple question.

[1641. 70-1646. 70] I would like to ask the general manager to guide us in this opportunity. [1646. 70-1649. 70] That is because of the strong market. [1649. 70-1653. 70] I would like to look at my own bank from the company in the past. [1653. 70-1657. 70] This development of my own is really a good result.

So far, it looks like every year EPS can have this two or three rounds. Or every year, that's what this market is all about. That's how we go about it. It's also possible to have some customer relationships. Then it can lead us to think that this market is a share capital.

I want to understand this market. You just saw a part of the development of some strategy. I should think about this strong topic. It is in this market. It is in the current environment.

Its cater. What a situation it is for a market that is resistant to. Even in the case of a non-growth rate. That's what we want in this pie. We want to get an effective market share.

We believe in the resurrection of the dead, or the resurrection of the just, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the just, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust, or the judgment of the unjust.

Thank you. I'm going to say it again. We're going to transition to Rugged Computers. There are, of course, some of them. We have some strategic relationships. That's because we already have an OEM client.

But the main thing we do is to do it. Rugged laptops. But at that time, it was actually a low percentage of our business. At that time, it was not our business. It was similar to a side job. But later it was discussed.

In the last few years, the transition has been discussed. Of course, it is to analyze the situation of this market. That is, if consumers and commercial parts. Unless you can receive a large OEM customer.

In other words, it is. The wheel waste has been emphasized in the past is actually in research and development. But when this consumer and commercial. This value developed to the city of Chengdu R & D. The added value is not very high. It is mainly a company in Taiwan.

The main added value lies in the production. Management of the supply side. That is not really our expertise. So we decided to choose one later. The added value of the R&D is relatively high. In other words, it can be converted to a relatively high gross profit margin.

Then we chose this. The Rugged mobile device. That's another transition in the middle of course. Except for the transition from commercial to rocket.

Another thing is that you want to convert from a OEM to a brand. So this is another transition project. So I think this is about overall. The market is actually its component growth rate. That's its negative energy rate. It's not particularly high.

It's a stable compound growth. But it's too late to come in. So we're talking about it. We really don't need to worry too much about the compound growth rate.

This will become your remittance. So we should now focus on how to strengthen our own brand. vs our competitors. How to strengthen our products vs our competitors. Don't worry about the growth of the entire market is explosive.

That's what I think is possible after that. The market may have some volatility in its compound growth rate. Mainly in some cases, for example, now. That's what AI is all about. And it's also slowly moving into the field of rocket. And I hope it brings a little stimulus.

And then let this compound growth rate be possible. And there is a slight difference. Thank you. And there is something else to follow. We have seen it for years.

In recent years, we have not seen nearly half of it. So of course, we can say that we just grew up with it. Maybe it's just the right catch out. Catch out of the war in Europe. In other words, it's the war in Europe.

Of course, there may be a positive factor with negative factors. It is inconvenient. It is not convenient. So we may have one more. Or the end of the war. What do you think is the fastest need?

Say we can also maintain the growth rate of the past few years is a reference. Or it will stop. I think it is in the past regional conflict. Some of the effects of the film on the upper wings will be fixed in the past two or three years.

In fact, the problem is now. We can't see the signs of the regional conflict stopping. That is, Trump's expenditures for compulsating various European countries to expand his defense budget. So we expect this part of Europe.

Because Trump. Because it's too conservative to speak of just Oscar. Trump's demands are not two parties. Trump's demands. His defense minister's demands are five percent. That's what I personally think of five percent.

He meant that the U.S. would withdraw from domestic investment completely. Because the U.S. now accounts for about half of its domestic investment. The U.S. foreign investment expenditure is that everyone should double. The double is carrying the fourth grade is close to 15. This is not a goal that can be achieved in a year or two. So I think about Europe.

The kinetic power of this defense budget expenditure exists. Instead, it needs to be calculated because of the limited budget period of the government. So it must have a negative effect. So the defense budget increases. May public safety decrease.

He is not all-powerful, all-knowing, all-powerful, all-powerful, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving, all-loving.

There must be some decline. That's why it's about the public sector. It may have some exclusions for other public sectors. But we expect one. The movement of this part will be offset. That part.

The other part of the negative negative. That is, the war slowly enters the end. In fact, for the consumption of the people, should be the capital expenditure of this company. They will be more grateful. So overall.

We also believe that Europe is next. Just got a problem. I forgot to ask you for information. In your just-industry content. Application. Military Public Safety Dangerous Industries.

"This is a year in which we will be able to do this," he said, "and we will be able to do this for a year in which we will be able to do it."
