<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to the sentences corresponding to each timestamp. The user has broken down the content by timestamp, and my task is to consolidate the sentences into a coherent paragraph while keeping the sequence and content of the original sentences. It is necessary to ensure that each sentence appears in the correct position and that the transition between the paragraphs is natural. Next, I will observe the logical relationship between the sentences and see which sentences can be combined into a paragraph. For example, there are a few sentences in the opening section about the beginning of the forum and the introduction of the guest, which can be combined into a paragraph.

It is important to note that the user mentioned the phrase "permanently chopped verbatim" may contain some repetitive or oral expressions, such as "Today is just honored to participate in the concert" and "Today is a little scary", which need to be preserved as it is, and cannot be modified. At the same time, some sentences may have small errors, such as [82. 96-88. 00] and [88. 08-90. 16], there is a time interval between the timestamp, but according to the content provided by the user, must be handled strictly according to the given timestamp and cannot be adjusted. In the process, I will check in a sentence whether there are omissions or wrong positions.

In addition, be aware that some sentences may not be grammatically or logically consistent, such as "Today is just an honor to participate in this concert" and "Today is a bit scary", but according to the user's requirements, the original sentence must be kept, so it is necessary to keep the original sentence, which may be handled by segmentation. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph typed text to ensure that there is no missing any sentences, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, conforming to the smoothness of spoken expression. At the same time, check for formatting errors, such as timestamps correctly correspond, punctuation marks are appropriate, to ensure that the final output conforms to the user's requirements.

Thank you, everyone, and thank you for the invitation to participate in this concert. Today is a bit scary. There are too many people holding here, we feel the same way as before, and we have to respond to our recent stock price. But first of all, this is probably the case. Because in 2024, after Li Dong came, Li Dong was elected as our chairman in 2023, and then gradually followed the company's entire organizational structure, responsible for making some adjustments.

In 2024, of course, there are some unknown reasons, resulting in the reduction of the stock market, the stock market decline is relatively large, and we will probably make some explanations. But for 2025, we can also expect that we will do a report with you. Today may be a bad day to say that our board is scheduled on March 11th, so on March 11th, we will have a 2024 report. So today, the financial figures are probably the number of Q3 first.

The second is that we have a general distribution of the whole silver scotch in 2025, and we have a major source of motivation for the future growth. The third part is that, as we have just said, the number that may be first used is on the main line, please refer to the fourth part, because the company has recently increased ESG, there are related issues, so let's do a report with you.

Q4 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q3 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q4 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q3 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q2 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q3 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q4 is the best way to get the most out of it. Q3 is the best way to get the most out of it.

In addition, in the communication products, especially in Southeast Asia, there is also a better way than we expected. So some people note that the principle of decline is less than 5%, and this little bit is a better performance than we originally expected. OK, that is probably a situation of Q words, that is, it is a recession, but a little bit smaller than we originally expected, so it is probably a situation of Q words. Next I may explain, that is, it is a 24-year overview of last year. In fact, it is our main main product, but most of them are in the consumer product, the consumer product customers, because last year this new product exchange period, leading to the old product not shipped, the new product is not released, and in fact, this is the reason for this decline in our revenue, because the effect is relatively large.

So, in the second half of the year, I took a more conservative attitude, which said that by the fourth quarter, the customer exports here also because of geopolitical factors, shipping is also some influence. So in fact, we expect to have a double-digit growth, but in fact, it looks like a double-digit number. So, in fact, the two-digit is a double-digit, called double-digit double-digit. So, for the consumer and automotive products, these two-digit double-digits, resulting in our two-year coin revenue, called two-year double-digit, that is the main reason.

But what we have said before is that, in fact, luxuries and consumer companies account for a new revenue, so if this person is fast moving, cloud mountain for the whole shipment needs to grow strong, but it will be thinner, which is probably the main reason for more than 24 years, 20 years of the total revenue decline. Now this time is probably a 20-year overview. Now it may be said that for two years, we expect to say that this year is the whole order recovery plus the contribution of the new order, we hope to return to about 2023, the whole company's revenue should be more than 250 million, in this direction to set the target.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user, sorting them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any of the original text, so it must be preserved sentence-by-word and arranged into paragraphs in the order of the timestamp.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided, each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. I need to put these sentences in chronological order, while consolidating the logical sentences into paragraphs. For example, timestamps from 404. 56 to 406. 60 sentences are "I hope to achieve this goal this year", followed by 406. 60 to 408. 92 sentences "Then it may be reported with you", because they may all belong to the same paragraph, because they are about the goal and the next report. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same subject or the same paragraph.

During the processing process, you may encounter some timestamps inconsequential situations, such as a sudden "2011" between 477. 92 to 479. 20, which may be a typographical error or timestamp error in the original text. However, depending on the user's request, content cannot be modified, so it must be retained as it is. It is necessary to confirm whether the timestamp is wrong, but the user does not provide corrections, so it can only be processed as it is.

In addition, some sentences may have jumps in timestamps, such as from 483. 80 to 486. 36 there are "two factors that should be the case", and then suddenly jump to 486. 36-487. 90, which may indicate the end of a paragraph or the start of a new beginning. There is a need to judge how paragraphs are segmented according to the context to ensure logical coherence. When dealing with the expense rate section, there are more sentences from 673. 88 to 765. 34, it is necessary to carefully check whether each sentence is of the same topic and a reasonable segment. For example, three reasons for the expense rate increase, each reason may need to be individually segmented, but also look at whether the junction between the sentences is natural. Finally, to ensure that all sentences are arranged correctly, without omissions, and there is an appropriate transition between paragraphs.

After finishing the preliminary finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to confirm that each sentence is correct, logically flowing, and in line with all the requirements of the user. If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the timestamp and sentence content again to make sure that there is no error. </think> Here is the paragraph verbatim: I hope that this year can achieve this goal.

In the second half of the year, if there is a new product, it is expected that the second half of the year will be bigger. This is of course one of the main factors. The second is that there is a previous mention of the Hawaiian new customers because of their new product model exchange, the new machine also began to start from last December to this year, and the whole world began to carry the load.

This is why we want to continue to maintain such a good gratification line, so this year we will continue to increase the gratification of the product, that is, that is, the proportion of medical care because medical care is Telemedic technology products, its gratification contribution is relatively high. I think that now we all know that we are the one in this industry, because the gratification rate is also better than our other products, so we want to offset the effect of the gratification of the gratification of the gratification of the product because we want to continue to maintain such a good gratification line, so we will continue to look at the market.

This is the reason why we believe that the price of medical products is relatively high compared to the price of medical products, but because of the relatively small number of customized products, we expect to maintain about 1% of the total revenue, which is similar to our previous level. This year, we hope that through public communication and consumption of these three products, the driving force of the combined fee back to this scale. OK. So, just mentioned this is the amount of revenue, so Marlon's interest rate is certainly hoping to maintain such a level as before.

The second is that because of the adjustment of the entire supply chain, we actually made some mergers in mainland China, because it may be expected that the capacity of the mainland order is increased, so we have to buy some idle capacity to do some adjustments to merge, so the generated some of these one-time costs, that is, last year. The third is that we are our fourth point, in fact, we came to the factory after he was actively looking for the fact that the ICT industry is looking at our object, because if we want to grow a lot of revenue or growth, it will be difficult to find our second growth through the merger model, so in fact, in the last year we put more in economic research or the development of this part of the merger client, so we will be relatively high in the second year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and sort it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sequenced sentences into a coherent paragraph, while keeping the original sequence and content of each sentence.

It may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit and then merging them into paragraphs. First, I read all the sentences to understand the overall content. It looks like this transcript mainly discusses the company's financial performance, relocation of new offices, ESG-related initiatives, and certifications obtained. Next, I need to determine the start and end points of each topic for proper segmentation. For example, there are a few sentences that need to be merged into a paragraph about the impact of the Chinese New Year holiday on revenue.

It is important to pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that sentences are arranged in the correct order, but the user requests paragraphs, so it may be necessary to group them according to logic instead of timestamps. During the process, I need to make sure that no sentences are missing and that each sentence is in the correct position. For example, the user mentions "[843.82-846. 12] Chinese New Year Holiday is January" and subsequent sentences, which should form a paragraph to discuss the reason for revenue growth.

In addition, be aware that there is a time interval between the verbs provided by the user, for example, after [934. 06-934. 58], there is a time to jump to [945. 58-946. 86], which may mean that there is no content in the middle, but the user requests not to delete any sentences, so all given sentences must be retained and arranged correctly. In the process, I also need to check if there is a duplicate or need to pay special attention to the phrases such as "OK", but according to the context, it may be necessary to determine whether the position needs to be adjusted. For example, [934. 06-934. 58-946. 86] The "OK" of the "last word" may be at the end of the previous paragraph, and [945. 58-946. 86" may start a new paragraph.

This requires a careful analysis of the content and context of each sentence to ensure that the final paragraph verbatim is both in line with the user's requirements and is easy to read and understand. </think> The following is the compiled paragraph verbatim (fully retains all original content, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed any sentence): The Chinese New Year holiday is in January.

The second important factor should be to say that this tariff policy in the United States, in fact, there is a big impact on customers here. Because of the fact that there is a pre-loading action before the Chinese New Year, the Chinese New Year holiday this year is in January, but our revenue growth in January is still higher than last year, about 2.15 growth. This is probably an overview of January. It is still in February, but since the Chinese New Year last year is in February, it is definitely lower than this year.

This week, I'd like to share with you a report on the number of people I'd like to post this week. That's probably an overview of our 25 years. The next third, the third sentence may be people to look at, because it's a historical number, and I think everyone's computer should have these numbers. OK. Then, let's talk to you again, that's because in fact, we're in the business type, and the company has made a lot of changes. Because in the new store and industrial area, it's a relatively old factory, of course, in order to invest in this one above research and development, looking for better talent, in the end of November, we moved to a new factory in Taipei New Taipei, New Taipei City, New Taipei City and Taipei City and Taipei Science Park.

This is a big event for us, because it is a brand new office, and I hope that there will be a better start in the future, with them to report. The second is that in fact, it is a very important project in this form of ESG over the years, so in fact, we have done this section for the company's website last year, we have made a whole layout structure, and then adjusted it. It is also welcome to visit this website for reference. The special report is that in our 2023 interesting report, we have been specially asked to confirm the accountant P. L. M. C., senior joint accountant CPA has helped us to report on this certainty, there is a third-party reading to my certification.

That's why we're more proud of ourselves. The other point is that we're talking about our annual tax savings rate of 15.8 86%, and it's not really that simple. In fact, we're just saying that we're going to get all the pipelines back, and that we're going to add water to it, and that we're going to be able to save up to 15.8 86%. This gives us an experience that we're going to do a lot of feedback on this, and that's why we don't spend too much money on our own employees.

In fact, we are a very big blessing to us, that is, we are a relatively high pollutant industry, but in fact, we can still get a recognition from outside. That is, of course, because the president party and the general manager of the company recently said that our overall evaluation of Taiwan's business is very important. But in the end of the year, we also commissioned the Taiwan Investor Relations Association to make an external evaluation report on the performance of the board, which was also done well.

When this year's board leaders did a lot of shows, then welcome all the friends who have time to visit the board website we are to refer to the information of the board. OK. That's probably the content of the presentation today, so let's take a look at the information you have, if you have any questions welcome. OK Thank you all.
