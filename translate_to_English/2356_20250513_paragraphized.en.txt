I am a downstream analyst at Inventec, Titan, and I am pleased to invite Mr. Jack Tsai Chi-an, Group General Manager of Inventec Group, Mr. Vincent Lin, Group General Manager of Server Business Group, Mr. Fermin Yin, Group General Manager of Laptop Business, Mr. David Ho Taishui, Chairman of Inventec, and Mr. Qiu Bao, Chief Financial Officer.

Now let's give the time to the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to tell you about our financial situation throughout the first quarter. Have a look at the Chief Financial Officer. Good morning. All of you, all of you. I'm Mr. Yip, and let's take a look at a few figures from one of our Inventec consolidated reports in the first quarter.

First of all, we look at the situation in the first quarter, and I have several key figures to report to you. The difference is that in terms of revenue, we have reached 157 billion in the first quarter of the year. This figure is more than the same as we did last year, which means that the growth of 1300 in the lower half of last year reached a 20% growth.

Another notable figure is our gross profit margin. In the first quarter, the gross profit margin came to a growth rate of 6. 0%, over 6%. This is also a high for our most recent year. As a combination of the total product shipment and the smooth increase in our production process during the first quarter, our gross profit margin also came to a level beyond the state. Therefore, because of the high gross profit margin, we brought us at the end of our OP turnover rate, the first quarter was 2.2%.

The amount is 3.4 billion. When it comes to out-of-the-box payments, it has always been to make interest payments and the cost of funds with us in terms of exchange rates, uh. The total amount of sales and out-of-the-box income is 2.1 billion before our tax net profit. According to quarter quarters, the EPS in that quarter was 0.17 higher than last year's 0.33 growth. Of course, since we were high in the fourth quarter of last year, our revenue was relatively high, so last year was 0.66. But the first quarter of the first quarter was 0.47.

Next, this month, jump to the next month. Basically, our product portfolio is quite similar to that of a quarter, but it's just a difference. So, below 1570, basically whether it's a laptop or a server so-called share, it's probably quite similar, and in terms of revenue, this is also because of the relative impact of the two quarters. So, the main difference is that we look at the next month, in the Mao interest rate this paragraph, it has a big impact.

You see the business outside of this end of income, mainly in the first quarter of the influence of our exchange is the impact of the exchange rate, and the financial costs here. The burden of interest costs here, I believe that we also said last year to extend to this year, a high impact on this end of the interest rate. Therefore, in the first quarter of our interest costs, our financial costs are still one billion dollars.

So the impact of the change in the exchange rate of the yuan, which is in the first quarter and the loss of this yuan, most of it is due to the influence of a change in the exchange rate of the yuan. This causes us to sell this end of the mainland, uh in the evaluation of a loss. This also shows that we recently had an impact on the export of our export industry.

Therefore, in this regard, it is also the end of the natural demand.

In May, the impact of the exchange rate is reduced, especially in the beginning of May, a dollar impact. That uh, just I mentioned a number, that we are in the exchange rate uh different currencies in the proportion of about 20% or more, so if you say such a trial point of view, you have a certain rate of exchange uh or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hu hu uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hu hu uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh hu uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh If you want to know more about the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future, the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future, the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future, will not only in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future, the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future, is not only in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future,

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to confirm that each timestamp corresponds to the sentence. Note that some sentences may have a timestamp interval, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep them all. Next, I need to arrange these sentences in logical order to form a coherent paragraph. For example, questions and answers are usually one-on-one, and questions and answers need to be put together with the same question, while keeping the sequence of timestamps. During the process, there may be some duplicate or interrupting questions, such as "that is" that the user mentioned more often, which may be errors or duplicates in the original verbatim text.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the time range of each sentence corresponds correctly. For example, some sentences may have a jump, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep all the timestamps and keep them in order when finishing. When finishing a paragraph, it is also necessary to consider the context of the conversation and classify the sentences of the same topic together. For example, the parts of the exchange rate impact may need to be arranged consistently so that the reader can see the question and the corresponding answer clearly.

Finally, after finishing the finishing, it is necessary to check again whether all sentences are arranged correctly, no omissions or errors, and to ensure that the format conforms to the user's requirements, that is, paragraph verbatim, each paragraph consists of relevant sentences, and maintains the order and integrity of the original sentence. </think> The following is the paragraph verbatim (completely preserved, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed any sentence): -- That is because the USD is also one of the most important considerations of the company.

What does the company do? Basically, I think that the sudden impact of this exchange rate and change is that we are taking a safe side, and we can think about how we can reduce this effect in the process of such a big fluctuation.

On the other hand, of course, I just emphasize that the end of Mutual, especially the U.S. dollar payment and collection, this has accounted for about half of us, about 70% of the impact. What we want to pay attention to is that the three percent. In addition, in the RMB portion, compared to the fluctuations caused by the first quarter, in the second quarter, and about yesterday, the Sino-US trade negotiations, there is some slight relief, that the trend of RMB if it is trending is slightly more favorable to our development. I think that this in the second quarter, compared to its degree of impact, should be reduced a lot.

Thank you very much. Thank you for the message from President Tsai. The online question, the first one is the increase in gross profit margin in the first quarter, which part of the product portfolio change is the driving force? You can see just one allocation is us, I answered first, that the allocation, in fact, the proportion of the proportion is not big, that is, compared to the first quarter, but this gross profit margin increase, mainly from our server products. That is, we are on this side of the electricity, it is maintained in this proportion, there is a relatively improved performance, especially in the server side of the whole server products related to the whole main combination.

The first half of last year was 1.2 percentage points, but the first half of last year was 1.2 percentage points, but the question was written down, so I could increase the profit rate, so I answered by the answer is because the gross profit rate is high, the profit margin is rising. Well, the next question is whether the tariff impact is affecting the customer in advance? The company expects that the second half of the year will be higher than the first half of the first half of the year, and the second half of the year will be better than the first half of the first half of this year?

Speaking of Server is good, in fact, the second quarter is relatively growth, compared to the first quarter, I currently estimate that the second quarter is growing more than the first quarter, whether it is on the server or laptop, the second half of the year if I just said that the second half of the year, the customer's estimates are relatively conservative, because the tariff uncertainty is good, so they don't dare to put too much of the same amount, that Server Notebook product line is almost the same pattern.

First of all, the answer to AI Server, in fact, almost all customers have Buy and Sell also have a sign, two have, this look at the needs of the customer, so two have, that accounted for the proportion of the amount, AI Server and General Pulse Server should be 50%, to the amount, because after all, AI Server is more expensive, so we don't have to buy and Sell, that's what we are in this section.

So of course, have you seen the recent U.S. ban affecting the orders of CSP customers in China? It doesn't happen in the first quarter, because the volume of China's CSP has increased, but it's not just about China's CSP. It should be pretty much the same for that second quarter. I think that at least some of the CSP customers, whether it's mainland or China's demand, are very strong. What else do I need to talk about?

And you say that the part of the embargo is not? In fact, the part of the embargo is that we should be passive, because it is a complete view of America's decision. So look at the U.S. regulations that we follow this path, and then see how to react. Well, then JB Morgan Albert continues to ask the question.

If you look at the year-round order, it looks like it's year-round. You don't consider the seasonal changes in the second half of the year, does the need for PC have any changes compared to the previous three months?

However, the impact of your exchange rate has to go down the riverlink. It was estimated that the year-round growth would be expected, so we now estimate that the year-over-year growth would be flat or small. This depends on the second half of the year, because the second half of the year is expected to be very conservative.

So if the second half of the year is better, then the whole thing will be better. Well, thank you, the next question is from KGI Angel. He wants to ask this just mentioned. How much will it affect the company if it is an embargo to China? What is the percentage of Chinese customers last year?

. In fact, the proportion is not very high, but we are now customers in China. But in fact, we do not see the order to sell to China. Because I think basically the customer is speaking to overseas, in fact, the proportion of that part of us is a little higher. So if you do not sell to China, then we will sell to China.

Some of them have permission to sell to Europe and Southeast Asia. In fact, I don't think it's going to affect much in basically three months. After all, these Chinese customers have a good inventory first. Well, not at the moment, there is no online, and there is no message part of the investment signature.

There are a few more questions to be asked here. That's just the part of AI Server. That's especially the GB200 or HGS B200 we discussed more. Or the next-generation GB300, HGS 300, this part of the product. Please note that the company currently looks at the bottom of the client part of the trend.

The company also predicted this. At what point in time, the AI server at high price can be more obvious for the company's operation? In fact, we are not very clear about the entire Markit. We can only talk about the internal Indar.

In fact, the B200 itself is relatively small. That is to say, it should be said that the B200 is already present, because it has already been shipped, so it is very desirable for the customer's needs.

At the moment, schedule. B300 will be mass production until the second half of the year. B300 does not actually know. But some customers have already talked about some cooperation with B300. That is just to say that we put the product specifications first.

The real B300 doesn't happen. That's why we're going to put the B300 product rules out. OK, understand. The next question is David Morgan's Albert. He wants to ask the next few seasons. Similar to the previous question, it's NVIDIA's HGX platform.

Moving from Hover to Blackwell is B200. That plus the previous ZT sale. Don't know if this part has an impact on the market share of AI Server in the United States of America?

Our North American CSP is about working with ZT. It's Indar. We're all on the board so far, and we're all on the board. Then ZT out the whole system information. This part is ongoing right now. That's actually one more Opportunity.

At present, there is one more Opportunity. We can directly cooperate with the United States CSP. Because ZT does not exist anymore. I remember the last season mentioned it. This is my personal hunt, the ZT sold part. There is no immediate effect on the General Server.

It is not known if it has been a while now. It is a business here on the General Server. There is no ZT company. It has been affected since it was sold. It is more obvious now.

Now, in fact, Ovo is speaking. Because ZT does not have its customers, his products are not fully sold. It should be said to move elsewhere. So ZT is still in operation. We continue to provide it to him. So this part is not affected.

That might be the pattern to take in the future. We may give ZT directly, or we may give CSP directly. Or other SI like that. Because the product has been developed on that side. Well, it's well understood. The next question is what KGI Angela asked.

In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of the total machine shipping of the server will not increase. The trend of the whole gross profit margin will not be stressed. The trend direction of that whole year's gross profit margin will be the same. The trend direction of the whole year's gross profit margin will be the same.

In fact, the ratio should be much more than that. It affects the gross profit margin. In fact, the gross profit margin affects the depends.

The gross profit margin affects theoretically. Your gross profit margin will go down as you go through the RAC. But sometimes it's up to you. That's not the accounting standard. We have a part of the RAC shipping is.

So that part will increase the gross profit margin. So overall, Ovo looks at the gross profit margin as a whole. It won't increase the proportion of the whole cabinet. It will be diluted. It doesn't seem to be possible at the moment, because basically, if the customer is consign.

We're talking about some things consignment. It really doesn't affect the gross profit margin. Because valuable things are no longer in the price of the product. Some customers are Buy and Sale. However, if Buy and Sale is a higher proportion, we'll deduct that part.

So that part will increase the gross profit margin. So overall, Ovo, we estimate that, of course, we do not change because of this. OK, understand. The online legal person's question is also complete. I'll ask again here.

Just mentioned in the report.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription of the re-routing process: There is no problem with this online, so I asked the last two questions here. The first is to ask Ying Wah, Chairman of the Board, what the business of this smart device is going to look like, and the next part of the tariff may have a greater impact on this smart device.

So the main Vietnam factory and Malaysia factory has been able to undertake this, because of the impact of tariffs on China, the Vietnam and Malaysia tariff now belongs to the allergy period. So we have been working hard in these three months to ship, that meet the needs of customers, so this impact on our customers, we actually have the most difficult time, this is what this is all about. Over the years, because of the advent of the whole AI era, for our intelligent devices, especially AI did not land on our confidence, smart devices, it can say that the whole industry is scarce. But now it seems a lot, can not come up with an example of robots, robots, or the electric vehicles, this business opportunity.

In fact, the progress of automotive products, compared to last year, the actual growth and large growth, in terms of revenue, at least three times more growth, which is mainly because of the speed of the car products Ramp up, generally takes a long time. So before last year or previous year, some of the cooking cooking products in this year will be a lot more volume, of course, probably the second half of the year will be more, but overall, this year will be much better than last year.
