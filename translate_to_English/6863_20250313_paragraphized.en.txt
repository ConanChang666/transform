We hope to take this opportunity to report on the business situation in 2024 and our outlook for the entire industry in 2025. Ladies and gentlemen, it's great to meet everyone here. I'm Louis Lin, the CEO of Ryzen RFID. It's great pleasure to meet everyone here. We want to report of 2024 and share our view of the coming year. So in 2024 we are very important year to Ryzen RFID. We have achieved the targets we set up up a couple of years ago. First, we have looked at the years for the feedback and at the same time we explore our ability to both both at our Yangzhou facility and Taipei facility.

In the US, we also expanded our warehouse system in the US last year. With new new materials and new production processes, we can do the same for last year. Well, sorry. So if we were to say that in 2024 we reached NT$4.6 billion in sales revenue compared to 2023, that grew by 71%. In Gross Margin, we reached 32%, an increase of 2.7 percentage points.

So if you compare the sales revenue to 2024 to 2023, we achieve 4. 6 billion Taiwanese dollars to increase more than 70%. And the Gross Margin part, we achieve 32% of that increase by almost 3%. And in the Next Income, we achieve 850 million Taiwanese dollars to 2023 that increase by 90%. If you just focus on Q4 over 2020, in 2024 the sales revenue we achieve 4 billion that increase by 60%. The Gross Margin, because we increase by 28% of the Gross Margin more than the Next Income, we achieve 260 million compared to 2023 that much double. We are very much to see the result. If we can see more at the same time as more than a year. When we compare to the profits by 20.

Food is also a very important new item. The UHF-FID requires a traceable system for all food categories since 2026. The technology that should be used at the moment is not yet fully determined. However, the attitude of GS1 or FDA is probably the most sought after technology.

Our other applications, such as medicine. Global markets have also seen significant growth in the past year. These are the applications that we will continue to expand in 2025. In the last video, we can understand the overall effect of UHF-FID transport.

In this video. We would like to introduce more programs. About the application using UHF-FID. So you can see. If we compare the differences between input and input, the application of UHF-FID will be over 80%.

This number also matches the number of Ryzen-FID indicators. However, we also focus more on inputs. Even if the total number will not be larger than the input. But we believe that input rates will be faster than any other application.

Food is very important to our new project for the FDA. According to the FDA new project. In 2026, each food needs an import system in the United States. So far they have not decided on the final technology. But according to the GS1 and FDA indicators.

We believe that UHF is the best choice. Compared to price and functionality, we all believe that UHF is an important technology for this new application.

Finally, medical applications. We also have a lot of improvements. In 2024. Well, we may be able to report. Listen to some ideas from companies using UHF.

UPS's Chief Vice President. As mentioned in last year's announcement. Because DAP. DAP is the Digital Assist Program. You can see the world.

RFID in the DAP system. Take a very important role. The DAP system increases their profits by 70%. The profits of UPS are $3.3.

At the same time. Amazon Go is very popular. In the past. Amazon Go used different sensors. For example, temperature sensors. Satellite sensors.

And with the lens system.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the structure to make it easier to read. Next, I will check the verbatim content provided.

First, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph. For example, there may be continuous sentences about Amazon Go, while the report on Zebra may have another set of sentences. I need to group these relevant sentences to form a natural paragraph while ensuring that nothing is missing. I then pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the converted paragraphs remain in their original order of time.

For example, the user mentioned that Zebra published the relevant information twice last year and needs to keep two mentions, but may be merged into the same paragraph. At the same time, some sentences may need to adjust the position to match the logic, such as introducing the company first, and talking about their specific measures or outcomes. There are also some technical terms and terminology, such as "C-LFOAM", "UHF RFID", etc., to ensure that they are presented correctly in the converted paragraphs without affecting readability. At the same time, pay attention to the connection between sentences, using the appropriate transition words or punctuation symbols, making the paragraphs smooth.

For example, the user mentioned "Cocom is the largest computer manufacturer" and then they launched the UHF reader, which needs to be presented consistently. Finally, I read through the entire converted paragraph-based transcription to confirm that all content is properly organized without omissions or errors, and that all the requirements of the user are met. Make sure each paragraph is logically clear, informatively coherent, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. </think> Here is the paragraph-based transcription after the conversion (retains all the original sentences, adjusts the paragraph structure only): Check each customer's shopping.

As you can see, in the next year, they will speed up their inspections and will also increase the operational cost of Amazon Go. Samsung, Carver, and Walman are using RFID. They also mentioned that they will be going on display applications on different deployments. Cocom is the largest computer manufacturer and will also launch the previous UHF C-LFOAM reader. Now the problem is not only technically, because the frequency is similar, so basically you don't need to change any computer design, you just put the C-LFOAM reader in, your C-LFOAM can become UHF reader. We are working with different industries and working closely with Rayn Luen.

You can imagine that if every C-LFOAM has a UHF RFID reader, you can basically check everything, because every one with a UHF RFID tag will turn into a free L-Tag, so you can basically check everything. So this year won't happen, but this year will happen. Personally, I think it's amazing, but when this happens, I'll try to put my phone in, and then try to find my Nokia 6-10 using the traditional C-LFOAM, because I think the world will be different. And ZEBRA's largest printer, they also released information last year, and they released information about it last year.

At the same time, they also visited merchants around the world and Europe, and you will find that more than 48% of merchants will conduct RFID last year, the number in Europe is more radical, and more than 60% of European merchants will conduct RFID last year. So in the previous picture, we also saw a lot of statistics on the reports, and the current situation used.

However, last year, Amazon started to replace these traditional Sensors with RFID, which significantly reduced the cost of Amazon Go's implementation, and also accelerated the correctness and speed of the overall checkout. Sense Club and Walmart are now users, and there are further explanations in last year's law fair that they will expand the locations they are using and the items they are using. Corecom is the largest chip manufacturer today, and then they released the first RFID UHF-reader for Android phones last year.

This is not going to happen this year or next year, but we believe that speed will be very fast. So this theory is that any products with RFID tags on it, you can track. So we have to talk about the object will not only mobile operators, nor only retailers, we will want you to have a home washing machine, electric refrigerator, a variety of items, all of which can be connected to the Internet.

Zibra is the largest manufacturer of printers in the U.S., and they have a yearly report to illustrate the introduction of technology and updates. He mentioned in last year's annual report that more than 78% of stores in the U.S. have been threatened by theft, which is obviously cheaper and easier to use than those in the big anti-theft system. They also interviewed the Distribution Maker of most of these retail stores, and about 42% of Owners expect to be able to fully implement IPD in the next five years.

In order to meet the needs of our customers, it is important for us to adapt to the development of the world and to implement the first greenhouse gas inventory in 2023. We believe it is a very good business, and we believe that it is a very good business, so starting from last month, we have published our first report on ESG, and last month, we will also pay our respects to all of our customers. If you are interested in joining us, we would like to thank you for your support. This is the question of Mr. Lin, the reason for the decrease in gross profit margin in 2024, Q4 product portfolio in 2024, Q1 revenue and gross profit growth in 2025, growth forecast in 2025, gross profit margin view, current market share and future level, whether there are other logistics customers, about the 2020 Q4 gross profit margin decline, we just explained, in the Q4 of 2024, let the Taipei plant to bear more production ratio, basically is a little higher, so the gross profit margin in the general, we do not have too much impact, because in addition to the gross profit margin, the last year, there is still relatively, almost double growth, that Q4 product portfolio, in fact, has been stable, in the retailing and apparel part of the market, about 80% of our overall shipment, we will be good with the other part of the future, we will use, we will continue to do with the same market, but we will be more than the next year, we will be more than that we will continue to increase the same, this year, this year, but we will be more than that we will be more than that. The spell will, we have analyzed, currently the largest market, the United States market, some of the top five manufacturers, in addition to the current manufacturers, we also have test actions, but in fact, at this stage is also more difficult to estimate, thank you. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

This is why it is so difficult to get a detailed answer to this question because the number of items we currently have is quite large, the size, then the different raw materials, it can produce a very different output per hour, so it is really difficult to tell in detail which plant it can produce exactly how much. If I concentrate all the small size in one plant, then it will be very large, but the small size is not the most in line with our economic effect, which is not necessarily, why need so much plant, the basis of each plant, each precious configuration is different, this is to make Eternity itself more flexible to different plants for different markets, different customers to do the distribution. But overall of the medium capacity, our goal is to reach a million this year, this is the part of capacity, and then there is no company name.

This is the only company in Asia that has a very important strategic significance for our subsequent growth and market expansion. That is not to say that you do this business is not always disadvantageous, but in this process, we can ensure that the quality of our products is definitely in the world Tier 1 Prayer, in this industry, I personally believe that the biggest permanent conference can see the direction of development. At this stage there will be some small and medium-sized manufacturers, but in this competitive situation, I would like to continue the development of the future development should still go in the direction of the bigger people, so we say that we can have the current market share, I think in the next year I am with colleagues, we have to maintain the market can be the same development, this is relatively healthy situation for the company.

On the other hand, on the other hand, in the cost part, we mention that there are several projects last year, we can achieve new materials and new production process updates, which is also helpful in the point that we can stay on top of Ghost Margin and Margin, so it is also helpful to see whether the overall price declines, this is a question related to Eternity, we also hope that this year we can maintain a high financial performance point, but I do not think there is a correlation, the average price of each manufacturer is also different, generally speaking that you say that the amount of each year to buy, that the average price will be much lower, that the gap will not be large, this on different products and other products are not able to supply, which is a big problem.

That's part of what we have to keep. But on top of the new application. I think logistics and food. It's the place to win. So 25 and 26 years. We should keep it.

The application of Apparel and Retailing. But it must be in Logistics. On both applications with Food. To be more positive. That's 2024 capacity. In the field of capacity.

We also pay attention. If we calculate the number of items in Deliver. The capacity utilization in 2024 is likely to be nearly 80%. That's for me. I think this number is quite healthy.

That China's analytical competitive advantage. We have to mention. That's what it's all about. Apparel and Retailing. Or the main application of this industry. But in fact.

It has a few possible changes throughout the structure. For example, from 2016 to 2022. It's about to 2022. The time of the six years. It's mainly driven on the Apparel and Retailing. All of them are large chain operators.

They are the biggest pushers, so you can see. Uniqlo Walmart. This is the biggest pusher of both the East and the West. That's because of the adoption of the two.

This is the time of the year when we will see the signs of the times, and we will see the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, and the wonders of the times.

They also start with RFID. Especially the introduction of UHF. This phenomenon is more obvious in Asia than in the United States.

So if you are able to statistic. This is what we do. Today, Japan's top 50 retailers. His penetration rate is probably more than six percent. That's all around the world.

The penetration rate is only 20%. Less than 30%. So we can see. That is, this is the penetration rate in Japan. Compared to other countries.

And when it comes down to it, when it comes down to it, when it comes down to it, when it comes down to it, when it comes down to it, it comes down to it, and when it comes down to it, it comes down to it.

Use small size. In fact, you're on the label selection. This retail will be different. That's what I think.

With small suppliers, it is easy to make. It is possible to make the whole market bigger, but even in such a situation, we see this consolidation of the situation in the years to come.

It should continue to happen. The direction of the future development of new technologies. Mentonberry. The chip we are using now. Refers to the video bureau. MN3.

The MN3-100 chip. 2008. The first one we used. The film office chips are under the shape. The current size is only about 20% of the size.

The size of a chip. When it becomes so small. It is actually in the whole production process. There are a lot of physical changes in the nature of it. For example, Dust.

But now we have a requirement for dustless. It will be much higher than before. So I believe. Glue 9. Glue 10. Glue 11.

Glue 12. Glue 13. Glue 14. Glue 17. Glue 16. Glue 17.

Glue 18. Glue 19. Glue 20. Glue 20. Glue 21. Glue 22.

Glue 23. Glue 24. Glue 24. Glue 25. Glue 26. Glue 27.

Glue 28. Glue 29. Glue 30. Glue 31. Glue 31. Glue 32.

Glue 33. Glue 34. That's why we're talking about Eternity. We're talking about all machines. We're talking about machines. We're talking about upgrading them. Then we're talking about the use of new materials.

This is a very important topic within our company. That's what I think the future of technology is all about. In fact, it's about how people control the use of microchips. This is a common challenge for the industry as a whole. Thank you very much for coming today.

We hope that you will be able to help us with our finance department, or our Miss Chen, thank you all.
