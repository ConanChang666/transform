<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcriptions and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format of the verb-provided format to a more coherent paragraph format.

First of all, I will read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a transcription of the company's corporate briefing, which includes openings, financial reports, market analysis, and so on. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same paragraph in order to make reasonable segmentation. For example, the opening part may include greetings and introducing guests, the financial reports involved data and analysis for each quarter, and the market part discusses the sales situation in different regions.

For example, when describing the decrease in the number of Chinese market stores, there are multiple "first three quarters" duplicates that need to be maintained, but may be merged into a more coherent sentence. Also, pay attention to the logical connection between the sentences to make the paragraph smoother. For example, when referring to data changes in different quarters, it may be necessary to adjust the order of the sentences so that it is more in chronological order or logical order, but it is necessary to ensure that the original intention is not changed. At the same time, to deal with some oral expressions such as "that soberness", "that provisional", etc., it may be necessary to adjust the punctuation of the punctuation or the paragraphs to make the passage smoother.

Finally, check whether the entire paragraph verbatim text conforms to the requirements of the user, without missing any sentences, all content is in the original order, only adjust to the format of the paragraph. After the completion, read again, confirm that there are no grammar errors or formatting problems, and make sure the final output conforms to the user's expectations.

Please contact our deputy for our company briefing today. Deputy request. [30. 00-32. 00] Thank you. [32. 00-34. 00] Is this sounding clear? [34. 00-37. 00] Thank you for your time. [37. 00-40. 00] Also thank you for the stock security arrangement.

[40. 00-42. 00] We took stock security friends to help me get the front and take a ticket. [45. 00-48. 00] This is a clear day, thank you. [52. 00-57. 00] Thank you for participating in the 2024 annual report of Foodstars Co., Ltd. [59. 00-60. 00] Thank you. [60. 00-62. 00] First of all, the company summarized the profit performance in the fourth quarter of last year, and the company thought it might be a good point.

[72. 00-77. 00] Compared to the period and results of previous years, the gross, profit and net interest rates of the fourth quarter of 2024 have reached a new high in the period of 2024. [89. 00-95. 00] Therefore, although the consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter is still a slight decrease of around 2%, about 2% from the previous quarter, the earnings per share in the fourth quarter continues to climb to a new high in the five quarters. [119. 00-121. 00] In addition to the improvement in profitability, we would certainly like to see a quick return to the original. [127. 00-132. 00] The trend of the consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 has also changed significantly. [134. 00-140. 00] The main growth contribution to the financial report of the B company can see the most significant growth contribution remains to the US market. [146. 00-148. 00] If the local currency is calculated in the first quarter, it is around 13%, the first quarter of the year, it is around 13%, it is about 13%, it is about 13%.

[165. 00-167. 00] All of the above are priced in U.S. dollars. [167. 00-174. 00] That was very exciting two months before 2025, if we refer to B's announcement of our own revenue, our U.S. contribution is still priced in U.S. dollars, maintaining an annual growth of about 13%. [186. 00-193. 00] The U.S. dollar revenue in the U.S. market in the two months before 2025 remained about 13% year-on-year. [193.3 00-196. 00] The same is also important, but compared to the second China market.

[224. 00-229. 00] What happened in February this year? [224. 00-229. 00] There is still a little good direction to go in February this year, and it is closer to the middle-number recession. [232. 00-233. 00] This year, although it still has a little copper or a little recession, it is slightly improved compared to the fourth quarter last year. [239. 00-241. 00] As for the Taiwan market, its revenue YY in the last quarter of 2024 has also reached 4% growth, which is a relatively good result since 2016.

[284. 00-288. 00] That is to say, the annual consolidated financial report of Bread and Western baked goods reached 78% in 2024. [294. 00-296. 00] How has this change changed over the past four years? [296. 00-300. 00] We have captured an approximate 5% increase in the past four years, that is, around 78% from 73 stocks. [309. 00-312. 00] In the meantime, we have looked at the general public today, which is a four-year increase in the gross profit margin of the company. [318. 00-323. 00] We believe that the continuous improvement of the bakery products represents the company. [324. 00-327. 00]

[336. 00-338. 00] Hope there is a positive contribution. [342. 00-345. 00] We then ask the public to invest in the market, and the revenue of each market is tentatively fixed in 2024. [348. 00-351. 00] In the case of currency new currency, the U.S. market has reached nearly 43%, the mainland has reached 42%, and Taiwan is about 15%. [361. 00-369. 00] When we enter the mainland market, the distribution of stores in the mainland market has continued to close some of the negative profits and even losses from the fourth quarter to the end of the year.

[417. 00-420. 00] We believe that we have been closer to the store adjustment layer, in the last quarter of 2024 closer to the store adjustment layer. [425. 00-427. 00] As we have also mentioned, there is also a very important growth or decline in electricity sales. [430. 00-433. 00] From the second half of last year, we began to see the turning point, from the worst July to the high double-digit recession, all the way up to the middle-digit decline in January and February this year. [446. 00-451. 00] The main improvement in the process or our three major sales of breads, mainly through the increase of bread sales to lead to the decline in the combined revenue and electricity sales.

[495. 00-497. 00] At the moment, we can only see that the bread is a straight line, but the cake and the item is the same as the performance. [503. 00-504. 00] So we hope that the second wave will see the cake in the 2025 continent as soon as possible to return to the perfect normal electricity export. [517. 00-520. 00] If the U.S. market, we can see such a column map that the growth in the last 10 years from 2014 to 2024 is very significant, of course, there was a disruption of the 2025 epidemic. [529. 00-534. 00] In 2014, we ended only 14 fans in California at the end of 2014, and now by the end of 2024, we have had more than 80 weeks, with more than 80 stores and more than 25 million dollars in revenue.

Sales exceeded USD 250 million. 85 degrees C entered the local market successfully. Outlook for 2025 this year. And next year 2026. The company's goal is to maintain an accelerated opening.

Taiwan's food culture will be combined. And the local flavor of the products. Bring more consumers across the United States. This year, the company stores in the United States. The growth goal of the number of stores is to have a low double digits. The low double digits is more than 11.

We have opened two stores in January. So we can compare the number of U.S. stores from 79 to 81 at the end of last year.

Growth from 66 to 79. Over the past 3 years, total 66 has grown to 79. That is 13. 5. That is the opposite of 2025 or 2026. This year or next year. Single year.

In a single year, our company wanted to see an increase in the number of stores. It was probably the sum of the past three years. So this is what we said by a friend of ours. So what is the concept of acceleration? Here are two pictures of us in January. The grand opening of New York City.

On the left is our Flux in New York City. On the right is our New Jersey. Two southeast. The first and second stores in the south. The two stores were opened in December 2024.

That was the grand opening before January of that year. It was the third store in Southeast Asia. It is also in reserve. It is determined that this year will open. In terms of market expansion, we see the store is.

What we see is. In terms of market expansion. In terms of market expansion. In terms of market expansion. This year and next year. In a store with more than 20 eager to open. There is a relatively high chance.

More than half will come from markets outside the West Bank. That's why it echoes the company. We observe what the local team observes. From various states. Many different cities. Even the consumption needs of different ethnic groups.

The company thinks that the company thinks that the back of the strong demand we observe, in fact, there is no reason for him, in the clear positioning of the brand.

We've been in this situation for years. The price is high in the environment. 85 Â° C. Maintaining a very competitive price in the local area. Maintaining a very competitive price in the local area.

At the same time, compared to other local companies. Of course, there are bakers in the same industry. Of course there are bakers in the same industry. 85 degrees C product line. More variety. Quality and product development.

Quality and product development. We believe it is also more competitive. Take the last three months of the fourth quarter of 2024 as an example. denominated in local currency. Bread Western and beverage business. Bread Western and beverage business.

There is a significant year-over-year increase in bread. There is also a West Point. Its year-over-year increase is faster than the third quarter. It is low and the Lord is high.

You can ask for electricity at the end of 2024. You can ask for electricity at the end of 2024. And the outlook for electricity at the end of 2025.

It is reported from the number of electricity in the two major markets in 2024. It is reported from the number of electricity in the two major markets in 2024. The mainland. The end of mainland 2024 is approximately 460 days. The end of mainland 2024 is approximately 460 days.

If it is to be expected at the end of 2025. If it is to be expected at the end of 2025. There are still some variables. But from the company currently seen. Some changes in the operating environment of the mainland. Some changes in the operating environment of the mainland.

There are also some growth in the industry and some companies themselves. There are implementations of the company's own strategy. We believe that a larger opportunity. A relatively large opportunity to end in 2025. Electricity in the mainland market. May be with the present.

460 days is unknown. Relatively unknown. Maybe high or low. But we think the current view. A larger chance is that the phone won't come. A larger chance is that the phone won't come.

The continent's mainstay for the whole year of 2025 is still on the rise. The increase in monopoly revenue is still on the rise. The first hope we've just said is that the supply continues to grow.

Cakes are growing as fast as they can. Cakes are growing as fast as we can. As long as we can make a single-electric revenue. Back in 2025, we're getting closer to a year-over-year performance.

We see him, and we see him, and we see him.

This is my answer, the mainland market 2024 has the direction of electricity in 2025, and there is also the direction of electricity, if it is the fastest growing U.S. market, the end of 2024, I do not consider December market operation two words, the number of electricity is 79, until January 2025, we are very happy to see the east coast market opened two, the grand opening of the news market, the number of electricity to 81, we are very aware, we hope to see a clear increase in power generation than the last three years, that is at least 11 or more batteries, so in 2025, it is a good chance, the 80th level of television will be more than 90, will be more than 90.
