We invite you to join us today at the Taiwan-based online legal forum. Today, we invite you to share with us a little update on the company's current situation. We will follow up on the Q&A later.

First of all, I would like to thank you for investing in the online book conference after the announcement of the first quarter earnings report by Fubon Securities. I am Yuqing Chong, a spokesperson for the first quarter of the financial report, and Mr. Wang Kaihong Ken, a colleague of ours. First of all, I would like to give you a briefing on the results of the first quarter, and then provide our opinion on the outlook for the second quarter. Based on the announcement of the company, the number of financial forecasts is not enough to explain the outlook for the product line, and the final part of the investor Q&A is that we have signed the NDA confidentiality agreement with our clients, so it is impossible to comment on the future product design structure, delivery schedule or delivery volume of a single client.

First of all, the disclaimer part, because including but not limited to market demand, price fluctuations, competitions, supply chain changes, global economic situation, exchange rate fluctuations and other factors beyond the company's control, the actual operation, financial situation and the development of the company may be different from the company in the forecast or implied description. This briefing if there is a forward-looking estimate of the future, only reflects the company's view at the time of release, the company is not obliged to update the forward-looking estimate in the future situation, which is a meeting agenda today, the first part is the first part of the industry position and the gap from our competitors, we will continue to expand, the third part is the advantage of our growth is where, the first part is the technology, the second part is to the scale and the production site, and finally is a period of our QO.

In the first quarter of the year, the net income is about 3.4 billion yuan, compared with the fourth quarter of the year, QOQ growth 31%, compared with the same period of the year close to 21% YY growth 75.4%, EPS 10.01 billion, we are the new high in history, and profit is more than a share capital in the quarter, which is a single-quarter profit. This tax rate is about 24.700 yuan, but 25.7%, mainly because in the first quarter, we did not allocate the total tax revenue of about 1.6 billion yuan. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-phrase transcript: QOQ grew 23% in the first quarter, mobile devices were 1%, and the automotive industry was 16% in the second quarter of the year. If you look at the year-to-year perspective, then the revenue in the first quarter of the year is 12.9 billion. If you would like to remind us of the portfolio of products we have in the same period last year, the share of infrastructure is about 50 to 55%, and the mobile device is between 30 to 35%, and the automotive industry and others are between 10 to 15%.

So, the strong growth of our infrastructure reflects a continuing increase in our high-end materials market share. That is a comparison to our main Taiwan counterparts. In the first quarter of last year, our revenue was $1.2 billion, and the total revenue of the two major domestic competitors was about 1.6 billion. So we exceeded them by 22%. This is the first quarter of last year, but we saw that in the first quarter of this year we had revenues of $1.7 billion, they increased by $1.9 billion, and our revenue exceeded 55%.

In 2017, our market share is probably zero, but according to the data released by Prismark in 2003, our market share has reached number 1 in the world by 28.4%. It may be announced at the end of May this year, but based on what we just reported, our gap with the industry continues to grow.

According to our own internal estimates, last year's market share in the high-speed market should be more than 35% of the market share. Many investors would be worried that the market will continue to grow. Therefore, the report of the broker and our actual operating results will be explained. Brokers estimate that the compound annual growth rate of the entire high-end CCO market is 28% from 2024 to 2027. The compound annual growth rate of the market is about 12%.

So we have far exceeded the growth rate of the entire high-end peer market. So why can we continue to stay ahead of the high-end peer market? In fact, the main reason is that the technology of our HDI process continues to be the same as one of our peers in Taiwan and mainland China from this table, and we can see that Japan and Korea may have the same technology as us in the high-end market, but they have no way to compare their productivity to the cost.

The first thing you have to say is that the quality of your materials is in place, and you will be able to mass production after your materials are in place. So you need production capacity. This part of Japan and Korea really doesn't have much expansion in the past years. So they can't really meet the needs of customers here.

We are the only manufacturer in the Asia region that can meet the technical capacity and cost requirements of our customers. We are the only manufacturer in Asia who can meet the technical capacity and cost requirements of our customers. Then we talk about our scale and global layout, and we all know that Japan and Korea really have no limited expansion capacity in the past few years. This is our expansion plan.

This is why we expect our production capacity to be around 4.3 million at the end of last year, and this year there will be about 300,000 production capacity at the Yellowstone Plant in the second quarter of the year. In the third quarter of the year, there will be 600,000 production capacity at the Zhongshan Plant, and 600,000 production capacity in the fourth quarter of the year. We have previously reported that our Yellowstone Plant was expected to open at the end of the second quarter of June, but now it looks like its production time is by May.

This year's capital expenditure is about 1.3 billion. From a cash-based perspective, it's worth it. The capital expenditure of the Malaysian plant is about 4 billion, the Huangshi plant is about 2 billion, and the upgrade capital expenditure of the US plant is about 7 billion.

In addition, it is said that the normal maintenance cost of the annual tax break in each plant is about 7 billion. We expect to have 300,000 capacity in Taiyuan by the end of next year, which is about 46 billion capital expenditure.

This is part of our sustainability report, and we are currently updating this year's sustainability report, which will be a more detailed explanation for the carbon reduction and the carbon emissions we care about. So, in the future, we will look forward to seeing the development of the entire product line in a positive manner, from AI applications, cloud services, edge computing to low-track satellites, and we expect to maintain growth momentum and business prospects throughout the year. At the same time, we also saw the new AI software to move AI computing from the cloud to the edge, driving heating of relevant needs such as AI PCs and AI Smartphones.

With the growth trend driven by AI applications, cloud services, and edge computing, TSMC will continue to grow in the strongest position because of technology leadership, scale leadership, and geolocation leadership. This is a presentation today. That's a brief before Q&A, I'll answer some of the questions you may be asking, so let's take a look at three questions to explain. The first is the tariff question I think many people will know, and many people will be concerned about the impact of tariffs on us.

First of all, I would like to explain this to you. First of all, we believe that tariffs are a negotiating strategy, not a final goal, so we see today's news, China has already assessed a deal with the United States, so tariffs is a strategy that it will not last long. Like the United States, Apple has mentioned that it costs 900 billion dollars to increase tariffs, so this is not the industry to absorb consumers, so there is no country's people to accept such a situation, so we think tariff war will not last.

The second question is how long the demand for AI can last, and now the AI in baseball is more than in the game, the first game or the second game. Then I think that I can actually ask you is your industry, then I think that you can ask everyone is your industry or how much you are currently using AI to deal with things. Like NVIDIA fitness mentions that you are worried about being replaced by AI, you should first worry about being replaced by AI, so now everyone is learning how to apply AI, I think every company or everyone is constantly using AI, so we think that this is just starting to move on, so we think that it is just beginning to move on.

The second half of the year will be the same as the second half of the year. So I mentioned that tariffs really don't have any impact on us, and I just wanted to report to you that there will be new capacity openings in our capacity in May, August, Malaysia, and December, so we believe that revenue will grow in the second half of the year based on the new capacity.

Our main currency is to trade in the U.S. dollar, but I think the exchange rate is really difficult, and we will judge that maybe it will have short-term fluctuations, but it looks like it will trend to a stable situation in the long term. So we think that although it may affect our gross interest rate in that currency in the short-term, we think that the exchange rate conversion to Taiwan dollars can have a little impact, but in the long-term perspective, it should not have much impact on us.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the rules of the user carefully to ensure that the original text is not deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to pay special attention to this. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like these are verbatim records from a meeting or interview, containing multiple questions and answers, timestamps and content alternated.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence one by one to make sure there are no omissions. For example, the first sentence is "in fact, we talk about us", then the discussion about the impact of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate, then the question about the product portfolio, and then the question about the possible non-contentual content, such as "ambitions for we 나오" and some unintended fragments.

It is important to note that some sentences may be duplicated or incomplete, such as multiple duplicates of the EQ25 infrastructure portfolio, which may be caused by speech recognition errors. According to the requirements of the user, it is necessary to keep these duplicate sentences, but it may need to be appropriately segmented to make them easier to read during finishing. In addition, some sentences may contain garbled or incomprehensible content, such as "ambitions for We 나오" and "diagnosing", which may also need to be kept in paragraphs, but may need to be appropriately separated in paragraphs to avoid affecting overall reading.

If there is any uncertainty, it may be necessary to further confirm, but according to the rules provided by the user, it must be strictly adhered, so even if there is a duplicate or disambiguation content, it must be kept the same. </think> The following is the compiled paragraph type transcript (totally retain all original content, undeleted, rewritten or condensed): --- In fact, we are speaking of course, whether the appreciation and depreciation of the Taiwan Dollar does not affect my competitiveness with the competitors, the competitiveness of the competition is the strongest.

I would like to ask TSMC to provide the EQ25 infrastructure portfolio idea (repeat four times). ambitions for We 나오, hoping to provide the U.S. appreciation of power supply Poke, diagnosing, tenínian monies, to close, chaininspires, suitable, Gulf (repeat three times), Gulf, teachers, ケilk, the fluctuation of the NT exchange rate, resulting in a gross profit rate, a sensitive analysis, and thank investors for this question. Would you like to ask the online market still have a question?

I want to say that I am facing the same cost competition in terms of copper prices, so this comparison is a short-term effect, will not be particularly concerned, we will focus on our R&D and our market share in the terminal market continue to grow. Is the first quarter results so good because the tariff effect caused by the urgency or the demand is so strong? The increase rate in our first quarter should be of a full load, so there is no sense that the demand caused by the situation is better. In the second quarter, we just mentioned that we did not provide financial forecast, but in terms of the product line, the three major product lines, including infrastructure, handheld devices, automotive industry and other, can also have the opportunity to grow more than the first quarter. Especially in terms of infrastructure, now it looks like in GPU or Ace customers even 800G products, these requirements are really good.

This is why our customers are relatively diverse, more important mid-end or OEM ODM customers, so as long as our customers' shipments are increased, we will also contribute our revenue to the increase of customers' shipments. Just wanted to mention the outlook for the second half of 2025, so I also want to ask you here on the short-term operation of the second quarter. This question has just been answered, and now it looks like the three major product lines should have the opportunity to grow in the first quarter. Now it looks like the second quarter in addition to the addition of new capacity, the increase rate should still be in the condition of full load. Now let's look at the question again.

In the second half of the year, the details are too early to talk, but you look at the mid-end customer product design, the material is still moving in the direction of the upgrade, you can see that the demand for computing power is still increasing. Do you meet the conditions of increase in computing power is usually only two? One is my increase in composition, the other is my material upgrade. So now look at the customer's design or go in this direction, so as long as the customer in the product upgrade or continue to go in this direction, our product portfolio should continue to improve.

This is a question I want to ask, this year, the factory, including Imperial Stone Malaysia and Zhongshan production capacity, the depreciation fee for revenue should fall, is it helpful to improve the gross profit margin in the future? Before we have to report to you, is there some major factors affecting gross profit margin, the importance of making a statement with you. The first factor affecting gross profit margin is the product portfolio, the second is the raw material cost, the third is the price dynamic rate, and the fourth is the exchange. So, I don't have a crystal ball, so the second half of the situation depends on the actual product portfolio.

What was the second question you asked? Can you postpone the Kunshan factory? The Kunshan factory question should be whether we can use the current agreement with the Kunshan Municipal Government to change the land until the end of this year. --- (All the original content is reserved, not deleted, rewritten or condensed in any one sentence)

According to the agreement we signed with him should be at least until the end of next year, so this capacity should still be before the end of next year, because of the new capacity expansion of our new capacity will be reduced. Can we provide the company's product line's gross profit margin reference range and new capacity opening due to the learning curve relationship due to the compression of gross profit margin? We do not provide so detailed range of gross profit margin, but we have to provide the gross profit margin ranking of each product line, the gross profit margin is the highest in our infrastructure, and then the handheld device, the gross profit margin of these two products are higher than the average of the company, will the lowest gross profit margin of the product line is the automotive industry and other.

This is where we want to ask how to think about the host of the same price, the material cost is actually down is not an expert, so we may ask if we are more inappropriate. That just mentioned our attitude to the same price is that we are faced with the same problem as our competitors, in fact, this does not affect our competitiveness, only the short-term, he has the same price up or down the impact on our gross profit, so this does not affect our competitiveness, we do not have to worry about the impact of the same price up or down to our profit, so of course if the same price is too high, we will also find the opportunity to pass this cost to our customers.

We have just mentioned that we can not comment on the needs of a single customer in the second half of the year, but you from the whole customer's perspective, they just had to hold their speech yesterday and the day before, and they actually have to increase their capital expenditure. If they say that their capital expenditure is actually increasing, they will increase our demand. Compared to the Japanese and Korean competitors, do not have a clear competitive advantage in the factory distribution and the factory process integrity? This is actually ongoing, that is, especially in Japan, their competitors are more likely to hear the needs of our end customers.

If we continue to develop our new capacity, the competition is not really expanding what capacity, so if there are some end-customer needs, I want to provide technology, capacity, and competitive cost, maybe only Taiwan can do it. Is the M6 or more than 35% of the products shipped in the first quarter? Or is the whole year estimated? The number just said is the first quarter, we do not provide forecast numbers, so we will wait until the earnings report out to calculate the classification of the products and the percentage of each material shipped out. Do you want to expand this year to the end of the M6 or more of the materials accounted for the capacity?

I would like to point out, of course, that the next generation of customer product design is going to be multi-level, high computing power, so the high-end material share will continue to increase, but can only talk about the direction, we do not provide this percentage figure. Can I update the 25th quarter of AI revenue share? In the first quarter of AI revenue accounted for about 35%, accounting for more than 35% of the company's overall revenue.

I would like to know more about the product category in the second half of this year, can you please let me know the specifications or other instructions? This is related to the design of the next generation of products, so I just started talking about it.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [2655. 50-2657. 54] We have signed the NDA. [2658. 06-2658. 82] Not convenient. [2659. 08-2660. 10] With you. [2660. 62-2661. 12] Revealed. [2665. 22-2667. 28] Here we would like to ask about quartz products.

[2667. 58-2670. 14] When the generation of materials will be mass production. [2670. 40-2672. 18] Or people in the R&D phase. [2675. 26-2676. 02] Currently. [2676. 28-2678. 32] Is the stage of sample delivery. [2678. 84-2680. 88] Is the next generation of products. [2682. 68-2685. 50] M9 products are now in the stage of sample delivery.

[2686. 26-2689. 60] That is to say, when mass production is really the decision of the customer. [2690. 10-2693. 44] That we will cooperate with the time of the customer to mass production. [2693. 68-2694. 96] to produce capacity. [2695. 22-2697. 28] and the preparation of the relevant raw materials. [2697. 58-2698. 86] To meet the customer's needs. [2706. 80-2692. 94] Please ask the EQ25 handheld device sales for the main reasons beyond the previous low season.

[2719. 08-2721. 38] The main reason is actually currently looking. [2725. 22-2727. 02] Except for the mainland. [2727. 84-2730. 64] The mobile phone market has a little recovery. [2730. 90-2731. 68] It looks like. [2732. 44-2734. 48] The demand for laptops is also rising. [2734. 74-2736. 28] This is the main reason.

[2749. 60-2756. 50] Please. [2757. 32-2770. 64] Is there an update to the online interview? [2778. 06-2784. 20] Here you want to ask EQ25 gross margin if there are any other factors besides product improvement. [2784. 46-2785. 74] Gross margin in the following quarters. [2786. 00-2787. 28] Is there any other factor. [2787. 58-2790. 90] Is there a reference to this year's DZ standard?

[2795. 76-2804. 84] Factors affecting gross profit have just been reported to us. [2799. 10-2808. 38] The first one is the product portfolio. [2800. 64-2801. 92] The second one is the raw material cost. [2803. 44-2804. 72] The third one is the revolving rate. [2805. 24-2805. 76]

[2806. 00-2806. 78] The fourth. [2808. 56-2809. 08] is the exchange rate. [2809. 60-2812. 40] So the impact of gross profit margin is probably due to these factors. [2812. 66-2815. 22] We also have no way of predicting the changes in the crystal ball. [2816. 50-2817. 28] The product changes. [2817. 58-2818. 60] is just with us.

[2819. 88-2821. 42] has been talking about it. [2821. 92-2826. 28] If the customer's computing power requirements continue in the direction of upgrading the material. [2826. 80-2827. 30] has not changed. [2827. 56-2829. 10] The proportion of our high-end material. [2829. 36-2830. 38] Will continue to improve. [2830. 88-2832. 42] That's what we've just mentioned.

[2833. 20-2835. 76] The gross profit margin of this infrastructure is ours. [2836. 00-2840. 88] The gross profit margin of the relatively high product line, so we can do it from this perspective. [2841. 12-2841. 64] Think. [2846. 24-2847. 28] Q. Q. Q. Q. Q.25. [2847. 58-2851. 42] Aseq accounts for 80% of AI. [2853. 98-2854. 74] We do not.

[2855. 00-2855. 76] For. [2857. 56-2859. 10] This question. [2859. 36-2859. 86] Answer. [2861. 14-2867. 28] Ok, the last question I want to ask is whether 35% of the AI server is only AI Server. [2867. 54-2869. 60] Also includes Switch. [2872. 40-2874. 96] Our AI Server definition is obvious.

[2875. 22-2877. 28] OM UBB Switchboard plus Mail. [2877. 52-2878. 86] So that's all. [2880. 90-2889. 10] Thank you very much for the time relationship. Robert did not hesitate to talk to us today and thank you for your investment in advance. [2889. 36-2890. 38] Participated. [2890. 642891. 66] Thank you.
