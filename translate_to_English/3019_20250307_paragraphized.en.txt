Please come first.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged into paragraphs in the order of timestamps.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like there are a lot of duplicate "good" words that may be repeated by the host or participant in the meeting to confirm or end the conversation multiple times. Next, I will ask questions about the composition and reasons of the operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2024, as well as different questions about capital expenditure, product production, Mao's outlook, in-vehicle orders, digital camera shipments, human-robot progress, Meta Lens progress, and so on.

For example, [1212. 72-1242. 72] and [1242. 72-1272. 72] have no content between the two timestamps, but must be left blank. During the process, I need to ensure that each paragraph is converted naturally while maintaining the integrity of the original timestamp and the content. For example, from asking questions to answering, I need to organize the sentences corresponding to each timestamp together.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the timestamps in each paragraph are arranged in order. For example, on the progress section of Meta Lens, starting with [1533. 72-1535. 72] and ending with [1561. 72-1564. 72], it is necessary to combine these sentences together consistently to form a complete paragraph. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as how to deal with duplicate "good" words, or how to disperse the same subject content in different timestamps. For example, multiple "good" words may appear at different points, each "good" word needs to be preserved and arranged in chronological order, and may form a separate paragraph.

</think> The following is the collated paragraph verbatim script (totally retain all the original content, adjust only the paragraph format): [1091. 72-1092. 72] Good. [1092. 72-1093. 72] Good. [1093. 72-1094. 72] Good. [1094. 72-1095. 72] Good. [1095. 72-1096. 72] Good. [1095. 72-1096. 72] Good.

[1096. 72-1097. 72] Good. [1128. 72-1129. 72] Good. [1129. 72-1131. 72] Good. [1131. 72-1132. 72] Good. [1132. 72-1133. 72] Good. [1133. 72-1134. 72] Good.

[1137. 72-1138. 72] Good. [1138. 72-1139. 72] Good. [1139. 72-1140. 72] Good. [1140. 72-1142. 72] Good. [1142. 72-1143. 72] Good. [1143. 72-1145. 72] Good.

[1145. 72-1156. 72] Good. [1156. 72-1161. 72] Ask about the composition of business expenses in 2024 and the reasons for the high cost. [1161. 72-1161. 72] This Wu. [1162. 72-1165. 72] Q4 of the fourth quarter 2024. [1165. 72-1168. 72] The business cost composition and the reasons for the high cost. [1168. 72-1170. 72] Is a brief description of director Wu Wu.

[1170. 721-1176. 72] The fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. [1176. 72-1178. 72] Then the fourth quarter. [1178. 72-1181. 72] You can see that the revenue has increased significantly. [1181.182. 72] This 31%. [1182. 72-1188. 72] Then the hard part of the operating expenses grew almost 8%. [1188. 72-1190. 72] I think that this is normal.

[1190. 72-1192. 72] We can see the post-tax part as much as possible. [1192. 72-1196. 72] The post-tax part is 3.7 billion as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. [1196. 72-1198. 72] also increased by 34%. [1198. 72-1202. 72] So basically we are in accordance with the provisions of Zhang Chun. [1202. 72-1204. 72] is part of the post-tax part of the post-tax part. [1204. 72-1206. 72]

[1206. 72-1208. 72] So there is a slight increase. [1208. 72-1211. 72] But basically it is not much increase. [1211. 72-1212. 72] Good. [1212. 72-1242. 72] [1242. 72-1272. 72] [1272. 72-1274. 72] We expect to double the increase. [1274. 72-1276. 72] At least twice as much. [1276. 72-1278. 72] The so-called double is the same as last year in this regard.

[1278. 72-1280. 72] There are about 2 billion. [1280. 72-1283. 72] Doubled or doubled is probably an increase of 2 billion. [1283. 72-1286. 72] This is probably 4 billion. [1286. 72-1289. 72] Could be a relatively large growth. [1289. 72-1292. 72] The third is seedlings. [1292. 72-1294. 72] Seedlands are estimated to increase by 30%.

[1294. 72-1298. 72] The original 1 billion increased about 3 billion. [1298. 72-1310. 72] It was just talking about this forest. [1300. 72-1301. 72] There were 6 billion. [130. 72-1304. 72] There were 6 billion increased to 8 billion. [130. 72-1309. 72] This answer was given by Ms. Zhang. [130. 72-1313. 72] Next is Ms. Chen's question.

[13131. 72-1315. 72] I just said that. [1315. 72-1316. 72] Capital expenditure this year. [1318. 72-1321. 72] Capital expenditure last year was about 900 million. [1321. 72-1324. 72] This year will increase to about 2 billion. [1324. 72-1326. 72] This year for many productions.

[1326. 72-1327. 72] and should invest in particular. [1327. 72-1330. 72] So it increased to about 2 billion. [1330. 72-1331. 72] Last year, about 900 million. [1331. 721-1337. 72] This year, about 2 billion. [1333. 72-1337. 72] And again Mr. Liu, who unified the letter of credit. [1337. 72-1340. 72] Revenue outlook for 2025 just recently reported.

[1340. 72-1341. 72] is no longer repeated. [1341. 72-1344. 72] Product production has just been reported. [1344. 72-1346. 72] Maori outlook should be 2025. [1346. 72-1348. 72] Especially digital cameras. [1348. 72-1352. 72] These just mentioned things are relatively high-end. [1352. 72-1354. 72] So it should be Maori.

[1364. 72-1364. 72] In 2024, the number of vehicles entered is about 1.2 million. [1364. 72-1369. 72] The number of new positions is about 1.2 million. [1364. 72-1369. 72] This year I would like to add a total of 72 million. [1369. 72-1361. 72]

[1372. 72-1374. 72] This is also the number. [1374. 72-1378. 72] The fourth digital camera to be released in 2025. [1378. 72-1381. 72] The digital camera is basically the whole machine. [1381. 72-1383. 72] What is the production capacity. [1383.1-138. 72] Just because it was recently started a year ago. [1386. 72-1388. 72] The digital camera suddenly started.

[1389. 72-12394. 72] 4 times 5 times 20 times are both growth. [1394. 72-12399. 72] Especially the waterproof. [1399. 72-1402. 72] are all very fast growth. [1402. 72-1406. 72] Just mentioned that there are 86 million in 2023. [1406. 72-1408. 72] to 13.6 million Taiwan in 2020. [1408. 72-1411. 72] Last year shipped 1.36,000 units.

[1411. 72-1414. 72] This year is currently two million units. [1414. 72-1416. 72] So this is a growth kinetic. [1416. 72-1417. 72] Fifth. [1417. 72-1419. 72] Human robots. [1419. 721-1421. 72] Entering and talking about the human robots. [1421. 72-1423. 72] At present, we are not in the market yet.

[1423. 72-1425. 72] A large number of people are in production. [1425. 72-1429. 72] So they are all in the stage of making samples. [1429. 72-1432. 72] So there is little contribution to revenue. [1432. 72-1436. 72] Next Cathy is Mr. Zhang. [1436. 72-1438. 72] The counsellor asks the same. [1438. 72-1440. 72] The vehicle has a variety of opportunities to go forward.

[1440. 72-1442. 72] Only the final customer had Japan. [1442. 72-1445. 72] There are Europeans in the United States. [1445. 72-1447. 72] Next. [1447. 72-1449. 72] Mr. Liu. [1449. 72-1445. 72] Mr. Liu asked. [1451. 72-1445. 72] Where is the difference in gross profit between Q3Q4?

[1454. 72-1456. 72] I would like to answer this. [1456. 72-1458. 72] The difference in gross profit is mainly in. [1458. 72-1460. 72] A size of revenue. [1460. 72-1462. 72] Then P3 is ours. [1462. 72-1464. 72] The highest month of revenue in 2024. [1464. 72-1467. 72] The revenue reached about $6.8 billion.

[1467. 722-1469. 72] That's because of the fourth quarter. [1469. 72-147. 72] This fast-year relationship. [1471. 72-147. 72] The revenue was slightly lower. [1473. 72-147. 72] So the main difference was the revenue. [1475. 72-147. 72] This was caused by [1476. 72-147. 72] Good.

[1477. 72-1479. 72] Next is Mr. Huang's question. [1481. 72-1484.1. 72] Q4 of 2020. [1484. 72-1487. 72] Q4 of the fourth quarter. [1487. 72-1490. 72] The portfolio asks Mr. Wu to report this. [1490. 72-1491. 72]

[1491. 72-1493. 72] Throughout the year 2024. [1493. 72-1495. 72] This optical component. [1495. 72-1497. 72] occupies almost 49%. [1497. 72-1499. 72] occupies almost 13 percent. [1501. 72-1504. 72] This is the part of our target.

[1504. 72-1506. 72] accounted for almost 5 percent. [1506. 72-1507. 72] One more time. [1507 72-150

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: [1603. 72-1607. 72] Is it possible to produce a maori increase in 2025? [1607. 72-1609. 72] Is it possible to gradually grow under product optimization. [1611. 72-1613. 72] This is something that can go to high level. [1613. 72-1616. 72] Is less than what people do. [161616. 72-1618. 72] Is not technically high.

[1618. 72-1620. 72] The threshold is relatively high. [1620. 72-1622. 72] Basically the gross profit will be relatively high. [1622. 72-1624. 72] This is the direction the Asian optician has been working on. [1624. 72-1627. 72] It is another Mr. Lee. [1627. 72-1629. 72] It should be Mr. Lee. [1629. 72-1631. 72] Is it a robotic process?

[1631. 72-1633. 72] has just been reported. [1633. 72-1635. 72] is in the casing. [1635. 72-1636. 72] Again. [1636. 72-1639. 72] Mr. Cai Chen Chen. [1639. 72-1641. 72] Q4 2024. [1641. 72-1643. 72] and the 2024 product portfolio.

[1643. 72-1645. 72] Automotive lens-based. [1645. 72-1647. 72] Whether the future is positive. [1647. 72-1653. 72] Just our director Wu also reported Q4's combination. [1653. 72-1655. 72] Then the following question. [1655. 72-1656. 72] Automotive lens-based. [1656. 72-1658. 72] Of course we are Asian optics.

[1658. 72-1659. 72] are hand-in-hand. [1659. 72-1662. 72] includes our cooperation with LGIT. [1662. 72-1666. 72] except Japan and Korea. [1666. 72-1669. 72] and several European customers. [1669. 72-1671. 72] are on trial for delivery. [1671. 72-1673. 72] will have room for growth.

[1673. 72-1675. 72] But their present amount. [1675. 72-1677. 72] is not a way to compare with the United States. [1677. 72-1679. 72] is my future bullish. [1679. 72-1682. 72] I just want EV cards. [1682. 72-1686. 72] is the story of the growth of electric vehicles. [1686. 72-1687. 72] This lens will also grow.

[1689. 72-1709. 72] Next Mr. Zhou Nai-An. [1692. 72-1694. 72] Mr. Zhou Nai-An is not Mr. Zhou. [1694. 72-1697. 72] Mr. Zhou. [1697. 72-1701. 72] Ask the company to present the proportion of product operations. [1701 72-1702. 72] Just reported. [1702. 72-1705. 72] The new framework for business growth in 2025.

[1705. 72-1706. 72] I just explained it. [1706. 72-1707. 72] I did not repeat it. [1707. 72-1712. 72] Taichung City Government Mr. Wu. [1712. 72-1715. 72] What is the outlook for the first half of this year. [1715. 72-1718. 72] Current automotive order visibility. [1718. 72-1720. 72] MetaRace has a new progress share.

[1720. 72-1722. 72] Robot product customers updated. [1722. 72-1724. 72] Just said. [1724. 72-1728. 72] Just my overall outlook for the year 2025. [1728. 72-1730. 72] has been reported. [1730. 72-1732. 72] The current car order is also reported. [1732. 72-1735. 72] is currently in the second quarter.

[1735. 72-1737. 72] There are currently no reductions. [1737. 72-1740. 72] All are good to see. [1740. 72-1743. 72] MetaRace just showed progress. [1743. 72-1744. 72] That's the two of us. [1744. 72-1747. 72] We focus on Face Detection. [1747. 72-1752. 72] Wave Guide used in AR.

[1752. 72-1754. 72] is in production. [1754. 72-1757. 72] Robotic products have just been mentioned. [1757. 72-1759. 72] I have reported that I do not repeat it. [1759. 72-1763. 72] Next, Mr. Chen asked. [1763. 72-1765. 72] Ask AR to introduce the path of evolution. [1765. 72-1767. 72] Your company is mainly responsible for giving.

[1776. 72-1776. 72] Asian engineering is currently in production. [1769. 72-1772. 72] began production a year and a half ago. [1772. 72-1774. 72] AR for the introduction. [1774. 72-1776. 72] With the introduction of the lens. [1776. 72-1778. 72] Both sides have lenses. [1778. 72-1777. 72] The lens is very small. [1778. 72-1777. 72]

[1779. 72-1781. 72] About what they say about cc. [1781. 72-1782. 72] About 1cc. [1782. 72-1782. 72] What we do now is 1. 1cc. [1784. 72-1778. 72] Everyone wants to do below 1. 1cc. [1787. 72-1788. 72] Two lenses. [1788. 72-1788. 72] So it was produced.

[1799. 72-1891. 72] But it's still a small amount. [1791. 72-1795. 72] Just Asian engineering Focus is the largest. [1795. 72-1799. 72] Or inside the AR lens. [1797. 72-1799. 72] Wave Guide in the AR lens. [1799. 72-1801. 72] But made with MetaRace. [1801-1802. 72] Compared to the current lens.

[1802. 72-1803. 72] is more effective than the current lens. [1803. 72-1808. 72] has a great advantage with the performance and price. [1808. 72-1812. 72] Next, Mr. Chen Jianrong asked. [1812. 72-1815. 72] The company felt that the robot had made progress. [1815. 72-1816. 72] Just reported it. [1816. 72-1818. 72] I am in the process of speed.

[1818. 72-1822. 72] Mr. Roof. [1822. 72-1829. 72] This year's growth momentum was better than 7 years. [1829. 72-1831. 72] Several projects. [1831. 72-1833. 72] Just said digital cameras better than 7 years. [1833. 72-1840. 72] The drone and the motion camera were better than 7 years. [1840. 72-1845. 72] And the quietness of the phone should be better than 7 years.

[1845. 72-1848. 72] Another is that the aimer is also better than 7 years. [1848. 72-1850. 72] This is as long as these four dynamics. [1850. 72-1852. 72] mainly from what I have already explained. [1852. 72-1854. 72] The current industry of automotive lenses is the same as last year. [1854. 72-1858. 72] There is no significant change compared to last year. [1858. 72-1861. 72] Understanding that the company is currently operating cash.

[1861. 72-1863. 72] But as the media progresses, it is driven. [1863. 72-1865. 72] There is technical development of MetaLens. [1865. 72-1866. 72] The business mass production is near. [1866. 72-1870. 72] Is there a need for equity financing or bank debt, etc.? [1870. 72-1872. 72] It should not be. [1872. 72-1847. 72] Because MetaLens is talking about it.

[1874. 72-1887. 72] This is also a constructive development of Asian trade cooperation. [1878.172-1881. 72] Not to mention the investment of billions. [1881. 72-1884. 72] There are hundreds of billions of us are the way of building the mind. [1884. 72-1887. 72] It is acceptable for the actual market. [1887. 72-1891. 72] I just said what MetaLens is capable of. [1891. 72-1894. 72] The wave guide for the AR.

[1894. 72-1896. 72] So we said that. [1896. 72-1898. 72] did not have much financing. [1898. 72-1901. 72] and it should not be necessary to borrow a loan from the bank. [1901-72-1905. 72] Next Mr. Yang Yaohua. [1905. 72-1907. 72] Ask Yaguang at the robot trading department level. [1907. 72-1909. 72] Just said.

[1909. 72-1912. 72] The robot is Maori. [1912. 72-1914. 72] The robot is superior to the company average. [1914. 72-1915. 72] So 2020 is. [1915. 72-1919. 72] So I just reported that I don't repeat it anymore. [1919. 72-1922. 72] Mr. Hui from the bank investment. [1922. 72-1924. 72] Please check the current level of robotics.

[1924. 72-1926. 72] We have a special company. [1926. 72-1928. 72] I have also entered the Civic Radio. [1928. 72-1931. 72] This is because the guest I did not bother to talk about. [1931. 72-1934. 72] But I was making robotics. [1934. 72-1936. 72] The camera of the robot is in production. [1936. 72-1940. 72] Ms. Chen, Chen, Chen of Yuanda.

[1940. 72-1942. 72] Q1, 2025. [1942. 72-1944. 72] is the outlook for 2025. [1944. 72-1948. 72] Each product is different anti-good. [1948. 72-1949. 72] Or not good enough. [1949. 72-1950. 72] Album. [1950. 72-1951. 72] is basically a good thing.

[1951. 72-1953. 72] has just been reported. [1953. 72-1954. 72] briefly. [1954. 72-1957. 72] is a digital camera. [1957. 72-1959. 72] There is also a car. [1959. 72-1961. 72] looks like we are drones. [1961. 72-1963. 72] and motion cameras.

[1963. 72-966. 72] Still aim for the machine. [1966. 72-969. 72] Good but close to the phone. [ 1969. 72-1973. 72] Next to the large investment Ms. Wang Ying. [1973. 72-1974. 72] I don't know. [1974. 72-1976. 72] Q4 2024. [1976. 72-1977. 72] Why Maori declined.

[1977. 72-1978. 72] Just explained. [1978. 72-1980. 72] Just reported. [1980. 72-1985. 72] Mr. Wang asked if there were any plans for this year. [1985. 72-1988. 72] What is the outlook and development for this year. [1988. 72-1993. 72] No one said it. [1993. 72-1998. 72] There was a hit on the report but no one said it.

[1998. 72-1999. 72] What does it mean. [1999. 72-2003. 72] This is not suitable for me. [2003. 72-2004. 72] The outlook has just been said. [2004. 72-2006. 72] 2025 and 2024. [2006. 72-2007. 72] There is a growing situation. [2007. 72-2009. 72] There is a growth outlook.

[2009. 72-2011. 72] has been reported. [2011. 72-2015. 72] Mr. William Wang in HG Capital. [2015. 72-2017. 72] Operational outlook for each product this year. [2017. 72-2018. 72] Just reported. [2018. 72-2021. 72] Q4 of 2024. [2021. 72-2022. 72] Why Maori decreased.

[2022. 72-2023. 72] This has also been reported. [2023. 72-2025. 72] Maori outlook this year. [2025. 72-029. 72] Air is in the layout of man-made machinery. [2029. 72-031. 72] The current operating income of the machinery. [2031. 72-033. 72] The operating income of each product in 2020.

In 2020, the operating income of each product was ratio. This was answered. In 2020, the operating income of each product was ratio. It was also explained. Sorry. Ms. Lisa Chan, Yuanda.

I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means.

The excavation case is in the excavation, in the middle of the public prosecution is more than I don't understand, what does it mean?

Then again, Mr. Yang. Current experience in automotive imports, as well as the following FSD. I am interested in Tesla's FSD. For Tesla's FSD. For Tesla's FSD. For Tesla's FSD.

I'm in the United States. This past November. Go to. A special rental. At that time there were 12.

12 o'clock. V12. 5 o'clock. Now go to 12 o'clock. Now go to 12 o'clock. Now go to 12 o'clock. Now go to 12 o'clock. Now go to 12 o'clock.

Now go to 12:13. 12 13.2. Look at that report. And I've tried it. 12.5 is very good. And I've tried it.

12.5 Very nice. From. I. From. From. Los Angeles. From. Drived by the plane. Drived by the plane.

Rent a car directly. Rent a car directly. Tesla's FSD. Tesla's FSD. Tesla's FSD. Motor Y.

Motor Y. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Drive disc. It can be delivered. It's also refueled in the middle.

Two oil pairs. It automatically takes you to the gas station. No refueling. Charging.

Charge, charge, and then send it to you directly, this is it.

This one, this one, this one.

This is this, this is this, this is this.

You eat, you drink, you drink, you wake up, you drink.

One, Google. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do what you can to make a sample in front of a customer. This is a benefit.

Fourth: Please ask for the fourth quarter product group. Fourth quarter product group. In fact, the whole year did not make much difference. Only decimal points difference.

So I made a year-round investment group. This is a revenue group. Let's go back to a simple report. That's about 49 percent in the field of optical research. The fourth quarter is almost the same level.

That's it. The digital camera part accounts for about 13. 1.6. So basically I took an integer. It almost accounts for about 13 percentages. Then again, it's the target part. It basically accounts for 5 percentages.

That's about 19 percent in CIS. That's another part of the optical components. That's about 12 percent. And others. For example, the part of the laser measuring distance. That's about 2 percent.

That's how it looks. It's very different from the fourth quarter of the year. OK Thanks. OK OK. Next, what are the explosive growth products for this year?

It has been reported that the most explosive is the digital camera. From last year's increase of 136 million, it can now reach more than 200 million.

One more thing. Drones with this. The camera used for sports cameras. Should be able to grow. The first two times the growth. Those two are the biggest growth kinetics.

It's not a problem, but it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space experiment, it's a space, it's a space experiment, it's a space is a space experiment.

The first one is GESTO. Can you analyze the robot business? This is just a report. Currently includes Japan United States Europe.

OK. Let's sort out the problem first. Please don't leave first. Please add more actions to all Ministries. See <|tool_call_begin>. Here we go.

Shipping of industrial robotic cases. Shipping of industrial robotic cases. It's my AV. AGV is not AGV. It's a left car case.

It's automatic, that's it. It's automatic, like that we send it. The bottom part of the food delivery. The robot.

This is also true in Japan, but not in the market.

And he said unto him, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for the time is at hand, and the time is at hand: for the time is at hand, and the time is at hand.

Mr. Xu Shenzhou. Invest in the red card. Please cooperate with LG. We are his only supplier. In a way, we work together.

The only supplier. In some aspects of the project. Because LG's products are a lot. LG IT is not LG working with him. Because LG is also a big one. He has LG company.

There is LG IT. We work with him. We have announced it in the past. In terms of optics, basically. They are the only suppliers.

Mr. Cheng. Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cai Kang Investment. Please ask for Tesla's MOTO Q. Basically.

I understand. Tesla. Whether MOTO Y. MOTO 3 MOTO S MOTO X is cheap. Basically it is used. FSD it is the same.

Because it is 70 degrees the same. It is for sharing. Share the flag. Don't let it use the software. So basically, no matter how many MOTOs you are.

Basically. As long as the FSD. Automatically unless it removes the FSD. I don't think Tesla will take the FSD away. FSD basically. No matter what type of model you have.

It's all right now, Miss Chen. It's big. It's my AR VR Security Division. AR 38 more than a year and a half ago.

It's been two years now, so I've been doing this camera for AR. It started about 30 years ago. Do this Wave Live. It's that Wave Live. It's a small amount.

But we have a classmate. Now we don't want to propose. With Meta Lens. With this performance is better. It's also efficient. It's also cheaper.

Do AR Wave Live. Again. Mr. Liu. 2020. Interest income of more than 400 million. Significant increase.

Will 2020 be maintained? Basically, this year's interest income. More than 4 million. Mainly this will be the reason for the continuous upgrade.

We all know this is going to happen, but we are basically looking at it now, that is to say, whether it is going to slow down or not, how much is going to decrease, I don't know, so basically.

It should be a level of about 400 million. Well, the next question is, Mr. Wang. Please ask when the car order will be placed this year. Just said the general customer.

Orders are placed until the next day. The fourth quarter of the third quarter. They all belong to one type. Estimated. But before June, they were all determined. The robot went into the row until when.

It's in the middle, it's in the middle, it's in the light, it's in the light, it's in the light.

Again, Ms. Shen. Please ask for the 2020 car rescue amount. The amount will basically be in 2025. This increase will be slightly. As you have just reported.

This year, KF-X has about 2 billion people. And so look at this. Purchase a schedule for this device. Thank you. Next, this Chen, the mobile phone is used for GAS.

There will be P in the future. As long as it is used in the camera of the phone. It is difficult. Because it requires the surface to be calm. That is, Lambda is more strict than that Mu.

This is the meaning of the parable of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer, and of the soothsayer.

P. Because it is formed after it is formed, it changes, so it becomes calm and runs away. It is not Lambda. It becomes a luminous change.

That phone is not close. Well, that's a step forward. This is a step forward. This year's cost rate is probably in what range. Mr. Wu answered. The cost rate in 2024 is almost 11%.

2025: It's basically a situation where revenue is growing. So I think it's going to fall on the same level as well. 10.5% to 11%. OK. Next.

Mr. Wu in Taichung Video Securities. Do you have a specific gravity of the customer area of the terminal without a wheel? What area of the loading and delivery area?

He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to timestamps and content. Examples of users, each entry has a time frame and corresponding sentences. My task is to group these sentences logically, form a natural paragraph, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same subject or to the same speaker's answer. For example, questions and answers about self-driving lens specifications should be linked, while the transition between different questions may require segmentation.

For example, the user mentions "Gloss ZPM" and "ZPM", which may need to confirm whether it is the same term, but according to the context, it is possible that some sentences may be incomplete or require context understanding, but under the rules, can not be modified, can only retain the original sentence. It is also important to pay attention to the processing of timestamps, the user's example timestamps are omitted, so there is no need to include timestamps in the conversion, just sorting the sentences in order. At the same time, make sure that each paragraph has appropriate guidance words, such as "please" or "come back", to maintain the continuity of the dialogue. In organizing paragraphs, there may be some technical terms or terminology, such as "metalens", "CIS", etc., need to remain the same, without explanation or modification.

In addition, pay attention to the connection between sentences, such as the use of "so", "but" and other links to make the paragraph smoother. Finally, check that the whole converted paragraphs meet the user's requirements: no missing any sentences, no additions or deletions, all sentences are arranged in the original order, and paragraphs are reasonable. Make sure that no Markdown format is used, keep the plain text, and the language is natural, and conform to the Chinese reading habits.

I understand that there is a large number of people in the mainland, and the lens it uses is cheap, and even its glass is not entirely glass. So it is different from the standard requirements. The basic risk in Asia is full glass, and the grey sphere is high temperature and low temperature, which is different from the requirements, so it is different.

At present, the risk in Asia is relatively high. Again, Mr. Liao, is the center of the human body of the lens glass or is the current plastic? Because of the plastic, some guests, but some of it is so, some of it to increase the appropriate amount, or even some with a very little, most with a piece of glass. Microspheres are basically made of plastic.

In addition, Mr. Guo Liquor, I would like to know a little bit about the possibility of using the lens in 2026. At present, the production is basically not 800 million dollars. Which area? Mainly in Europe, the Europe is faster, and there is the area of Japan. GMP will be better than the general lens, of course, GMP is because it is a microsphere, so the performance is not afraid of high temperature, GMP is because it is a microsphere, so the performance will be better than the general spherical lens, but the camera is a bit more expensive. What do the camera and CIS business look like in 2026?

Camera 2026 I think is still growing, because of the current needs of technical customers, the camera is definitely growing. CIS? In the past, we all know that in the epidemic period has grown rapidly, customers asked us to buy equipment, he bought equipment to complete the CIS, after the epidemic is a bit slow, now 2024 is also started to recover, 2025 should have some growth, but this business is basically stable, CIS is still stable.

In 2024, the optical blood revenue station included the whole, including it 49% should be the phone, not the phone, the sports camera is OK, the drones are included in the lens, so it accounted for 49%. Among them, the proportion of mobile phone lens car, the proportion of car just said about 10%, the car accounted for 10%, the car accounted for 10%, the phone is 0 in, the car accounted for 10%, the car accounted for 10%, the phone is 0 in, the car accounted for not high, the 0 in accounted for about last year accounted for about 8.6, in the overall of 2.6%, so there is growth this year.

It's basically nothing special than the overall drone and sports camera, because it's not something special, so it's basically the same as Models Margin. Then Mr. Wang, is there any new product this year? In addition to drone lenses, the new product has not been announced yes, I can't tell you now, I'm sorry, can only say that this year has been produced, just already explained.

In 2025, Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou, the expense outlook for 2025 is almost 10.5% to 11%, right? Please come back to Mr. Wang, where are you going? I don't feel that Asia Optics, like CIS, Asia Optics, are not directly exhibited, but customers in Asia Optics have exhibited in CIS.

Next, Mr. Wang, how is the progress of MetaLens for mobile application? Just talk about the sample production, when mass production contribution to move this is the customer's confirmation or customer may be slightly modified, then re-tested, so there is some time, but we are good at this, because there is a big advantage, mass production cost is much cheaper than the current use, and the performance is good, I have a long-term 2026 operating weight is not good, you can think of a very good product, now there is no way to tell you how much weight. Then Henry Yang, integrated GM Galaxy Moding Polygon spherical product development spherical chip, I already have customers.

The Galaxy Moding Asia Optics has been around for about 20 years.

The eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder, the eye of the beholder.

You developed a product for flying spherical chips. I already have a customer. It started 20 years ago. The main one-eye camera in Japan. A lot of customers.

We use GMP, which is produced by our Asian optics. We are called GMP, Galaxy Moding.

Then again, Ms. Lisa Chen. Ask the robot to enter the fossil use. The use is basically plastic. The glass is relatively small, so this is the problem.

Again, Julia. Ask for this year's robot-related product. There is little contribution to the revenue contribution.

The average gross profit of the Maori company. It should be almost the same. It should be about 19%. TIST. Mr. Chen Ming-Han. Ask the robot to enter the fossil use.

Glass or plastic compared. Just included. Plastic compared. It does not need to be outside the sun. So basically, it should be compared with plastic. Is the material used really good for our company?

Essentially, Asian optics are capable of dealing with them. These materials are designed with the design of optics. Mr. Zhou Minmin of Zhenhua.

Chip printing. Should be Metalase bar. Metalase NIL is. Nano printing it is not. Nano printing.

Nano printing was just Asian optics. All focused. Fast Detection and Waveguide. AR inside Waveguide. This should be because it's something new.

So Maori, because of its bright light, Maori should be a better Maori, that is, the question of supply and demand.

Please wait a moment, let's sort of sort out the problem first, please don't leave, it's good again, don't worry.

Good for you, good for you, good for you, good for you, good for you, good for you.

It is also used in sports cameras. It is also used in drones. Currently, the proportion is high.

There are currently about 300 million copies, and this is probably the case.

Then again. Fuhua credit card. Ask for digital camera in addition to before. Opponent refund.

Outside the market, outside the market, there is a salary, yes, no, that is not the case.

I don't know why it's so good, but it's probably because I don't want to be in it anymore.

The digital camera is small and thin. It can be 5 times. Or 10 times zoom. It should have been recently popular. Previously I thought, for example, only in the United States.

Including Japan, including Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, this trend, in a year or two.

Next year is probably the trend of this growth. Next. Next. The unified letter Mr. Liao. 2025. The reason for the rapid growth of drone motion cameras.

The main one is a drone or motion camera. The two parts are grouped into a light component. Yes, they are grouped into a component. Yes, they are grouped into a light component. Yes, they are grouped into a light component.

This includes drones. The total report of drones. That's 49% inside. So why? Because of this sports camera. Currently we are the main customer.

Outside Japan, there are mainland China. Mainland China has recently been working on sports cameras.

It's also ours. We all do business, basically. There's been a lot of talking lately.

Recently, the growth in mainland China has been relatively rapid. He is the main reason for the rapid growth. I can mainly report to you is. The area is different. The needs of customers in the area are different.

The two sides are correct in light. There will be mass production opportunities for the robot to progress. Of course there will be mass production. The robot will have mass production qualifications. I'm talking about the same thing here.

Then, your company is called inflamed. When do you hear it? Your company's products will be qualified for production of glass or glass or a boolean. Your company's products will be qualified for production of glass or glass or a boolean. Your company's products will be qualified for production of glass or glass or a boolean.

Your company's products will be qualified for the production of glass or glass or a glass or a boolean. Your company's products will be qualified for the production of glass or glass or a boolean. Your company's products will be qualified for the production of glass or glass or a boolean. Your company's products will be qualified for the production of glass or glass or a boolean.

That's generally the case. For example, there are eight pieces in a lens. Two pieces are glass gray spherical. The other six pieces are spherical, which is more common. This is the ratio of glass gray spherical is still relatively low because it is more expensive.

Mr. Wong asks the camera. The maximum speed of light is used by a large person like this. This is probably still in production. I don't think there is a way to report it. I can't tell you anything about the robot.

Mr. Zhu's E3 is not bad. It is now obvious that the driver or passenger monitor lens in the car is starting to rise.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. [3932. 02-3934. 26] Driving or passenger monitoring. [3934. 26-3935. 26] Yes. [3935. 26-33939. 52] Especially the car was driving. [393939. 52-3941. 56] In your car driving. [3941. 56-3944. 86] There was only one monitor inside the eight cameras.

[3944. 86-3950. 68] If you say I'm just saying you don't have to touch it. [3950. 68-3952. 86] Don't touch the drive. [3952. 86-395. 18] But if you say you're sleeping. [3955. 18-3957. 36] Or look at your phone without looking at the front. [3957. 36-396. 02] The camera in the car will warn you. [3960. 02-3961. 98] This is a surveillance camera in the car.

[3961. 98-396. 22] In-vehicle monitoring is coming. [3964. 22-396. 14] If this is the case. [3966. 14-397. 52] This automatic automatic taxi comes out. [3975. 52-398. 52] This will increase a camera that monitors the condition of the whole passenger inside. [3983. 52-396. 02] This is probably the phenomenon. [3986. 02-397. 06] The original.

[3987. 06-3991. 10] What is the principle or material of your Miss aiming device? [3991. 10-3991. 82] Principle? [3991. 98-3994. 90] What are the barriers to entry for competitors? [3994. 90-3997. 40] Customers add or quote customer improvement.

[3997. 40-4002. 74] The aiming target is a very old general American basically aiming target customers are all in the United States. [4002. 74-4004. 94] His aiming target is for hunting. [4004. 94-4006. 40] And he has a new person. [4006. 40-4008. 60] There is a new person to open. [4008. 60-4010. 48] And open some areas. [4010. 48-4011. 74] Then the principle.

[4011. 74-4014. 36] is the time of the target. [4014. 36-4021. 98] He is generally this time when he sees the animals? [4021. 98-4025. 36] He has a cross inside him. [4025. 36-4026. 40] The cross. [4026. 40-4028. 18] You only have to cross that cross.

[4028. 18-4033. 44] Basically the place where you hit is where you hit the bullet. [4033. 44-4037. 44] Not the place you see is where the bullet hit. [4037. 44-4039. 28] Basically the glass is made of glass. [4039. 28-4042. 48] Because he is the one who resists the shock. [4042. 48-4043. 06] Resistance. [4043. 06-4045. 74] Because the person using the gun is very rude.

[4045. 74-4048. 86] It is simply that there is a lot of collision. [4048. 86] Why the competitors basically have no competitors? [4051. 98-4053. 74] What are barriers to entry? [4053. 74-4056. 06] The barriers to entry is very difficult.

[4056. 06-4059. 64] Because he has some waterproof. [4059. 644061. 28] Shockproof. [4061. 28-4062. 68] You have completed it. [4062. 68-4066. 98] Must be 100 percent used every time to put it in the water. [4066. 98-4069. 82] Another one to use. [4069. 82-4070. 74] To make this knock.

[4070. 74-4074. 74] Then let the lens cross inside not run. [4074. 74-4079. 60] Increase the customer or basically this kind of customer is the same. [4079. 60-4081. 94] Say that the customer is the increase in the increase. [4081. 94-4084. 60] There is no increase in the customer. [4084. 60-4086. 60] Ask Mr. Wang. [4084. 60-4090. 60] Is LG Apple's partnership already in revenue?

[4090. 60-4092. 94] There is still LG. [4092. 94-4093. 90] Less. [4093. 90-4094. 94] Not much. [4094. 94-4096. 28] This can only be said. [4096. 28-4098. 28] Mr. Guo Lijun.

[4098. 28-4101. 44] Whether this lens is classified as optical business? [4101. 44-4102. 14] Yes. [4102. 14-4107. 10] What are the optical products and optical business components shipped separately? [4107. 10-4111. 10] What are the optical products and optical business components shipped separately?

[411. 94-4113. 94] The optical business component is black parts. [4113. 94-4116. 94] Black parts are the black parts of this plastic. [4116. 94-4118. 94] Black parts are what we are talking about now. [4118. 94-4123. 94] For example, this is the part of this plastic part in a digital camera. [4123. 94-4125. 94] It belongs to the optical business component.

[4125. 94-4129. 44] Almost all of them were about 12 people in total. [4129. 44-4130. 94] Then the optoelectronic products inside it. [4130. 94-4133. 94] I've been classified from there. [4133. 94-4136. 94] The laser distance just spoke with the Match NTT. [4136. 94-4140. 94] The laser distance and LDS accounted for about two people. [4140. 94-4141. 94] OK Thank you.

[4141. 94-4143. 94] A good year. [4143. 94-4144. 94] Ms. Lisa Chen. [4144. 94-4150. 94] Whether the number of customers has increased or the number of customers has increased. [4150. 94-4152. 94] This guest has come to us. [4152.194-4155. 94] Then the demand suddenly increased significantly. [4155.2 94-4159. 94] I just said that because of the relatively small number of customers in the United States.

[4159. 94-4163. 94] That now becomes a big increase for the Chinese customers. [4163. 94-4165. 94] For this reason. [4165. 94-4166. 94] Entering the barrier. [4166. 94-4169. 94] Entering in should not be done at all. [4169. 94-4176. 94] This customer has remained with him for about four years. [4176. 94-4178. 94] So this cooperation is good.

[4178. 94-4180. 94] He also sold it very well. [4180. 94-4181. 94] years old. [4180. 94-4183. 94] Ms. Lisa Chen. [4183. 94-4185. 94] Is the production close to special and identical to the lens. [4185. 94-4187. 94] is completely different. [4187. 94-4189. 94] He is near this plane.

[4189. 94-4190. 94] The lens is spherical. [4190. 94-4192. 94] So it is especially different. [4192. 94-4196. 94] The machine that is serviced is called the capacitor. [4196. 94-4198. 94] I would like to help analyze it. [4198. 94-4200. 94] What is the trend of digital camera growth. [4200. 94-4202. 94] Why is the demand so strong.

[4202. 94-4205. 94] What other digital camera functions have changed. [4205. 94-4208. 94] The growth of digital camera has also been reported. [4208. 94-4211. 94] Because I really don't know the difference between suddenly. [4211. 94-4212. 94] Since last year, there has been an increase in the demand for digital camera phones from all Europe in Japan. [4212. 94-4217. 94] The reason for this is that digital camera phones have come to a certain level of functionality.

[4222. 94-4223. 94] The other digital cameras have no functional changes. [4223. 94-4226. 94] Everyone goes to this 4K. [4228. 94-4233. 94] This means that you can use the digital cameras for this kind of motion camera. [4223. 94-4234. 94] For 4K changes. [4223. 94-4236. 94] Most of them are last changes.

[4236. 94-4239. 94] is also the amount of production capacity. [4239. 94-4242. 94] The production capacity is very high. [4242. 94-4243. 94] is full. [4243. 94-4249. 94] Full size also buy equipment to meet the needs of this customer. [4249. 94-4250. 94] Currently, this is the case. [4250. 94-4253. 94] Then Mr. Wang came directly.

[4253. 94-4255. 94] The biggest animator included the ticket price. [4255. 94-4257. 94] I asked him. [4258. 94-4259. 94] There is no way to answer. [4259. 94-4260. 94] Thank you. [4260. 94-4261. 94] Please check the capacity of the mobile order. [4261. 94-4264. 94]

[4264. 94-4266. 94] The second half of this year's revenue. [4266. 94-4268. 94] On mobile phone. [4268. 94-4269. 94] Of course, zero input. [4269. 94-4271. 94] This year will be better than this year. [4271. 94-4274. 94] And an increase of about 30%. [4274. 94-4275. 94]
