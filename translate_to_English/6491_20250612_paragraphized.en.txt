Below is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: Well, we would like to thank you all for attending the second quarter of 205. Here we invite you to join us for the second quarter of 205.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for your time. I'm a Jack I've heard. I'm going to give you a few numbers to make a report.

We have heard that the number we have at hand is probably a figure of 2024. This is probably what we all know in 2024. EBS is $23.47. It is no longer important. The important figure is that the gross profit margin in 2024 is about an average of 56% in 2024.

The cost rate is about 25% 26%. So that's the basis for 2024. That's it. By the first quarter of 2025, there were actually a lot of recessions in the industry.

That's mainly because the base of the fourth quarter last year was relatively high. It was probably the first quarter of this year, and the business in China is not very good. Fortunately, there are also the rest of Japan and Europe. So this business is a recession.

That's how much business has fallen. But the gross profit margin is OK. The expense rate looks a little higher. This is directly affected by that business recession. The final net business rate is 27%. The EPS is $6.27.

This is the first quarter of the year. It is about the first quarter or the lowest. After that, it can be seen growth in the main season. This trend is probably the trend.

Gross margin is actually affected by this exchange rate in the second half of this year, in fact, in the second half of the second quarter of May. The first one for that year is revenue. The second is gross margin. The second is gross margin.

This is the second half of the year to observe the fact that you have started to see the monthly revenue of that month since May, which has already been directly affected by this exchange rate. The second half of the year is probably not too optimistic about how much this exchange rate will actually affect you. That is to say, if I look at the revenue of May and see the growth of the following quarters, you would think that the impact should not be so little.

The main reason is that this is based on the impact of this revenue I make assumptions about how the exchange rate is based. The assumption that we made this year's business plan at the beginning of the year was that 31 pieces of the hypothesis that the exchange rate at the beginning of the year was still 33 pieces of that time. So the impact of the past few quarters is still slightly better than the original ones.

The percentage of Asians in the product portfolio is 80%, including China and Japan, which are relatively smaller than Japan. China's business situation has been relatively weak since 2024. The Chinese government, although there are some easy measures in this area of livelihood consumer products, so far it seems not to work.

So in Asia, Japan and China in general, I would say that Japan is relatively weak in this China region. Taiwan is about 14.3% this proportion is almost the same. Every year, there is a slight increase in this proportion. This increase comes from this beauty product, but the proportion of its growth is a little weaker than what we expected. So the contribution of this beauty product takes longer.

The most important part of the rest of Europe is that you look at this proportion of Europe without a rapid increase in the proportion of products in this region is that the proportion of products in this area is now changing is increasing the proportion of products that sold a lot of the water glue, the proportion of the water glue products is falling. So it is a bit of a combination of the changes, so this is a good thing is a bit better. Because the product retention rate of water glue is still relatively high.

So in this situation of uncertainty, we are likely to keep China's growth in mind to keep watch over how long we see more that review. Usually we don't expect very positive Taiwan here is a small growth and I like it too much. This is the product of this region.

This ratio is almost the same, 19. 3% to 80. 7%, this ratio is the same. This is to say that the speed of growth in this part of the brand is not as expected, not as good as expected. So, this ratio is still the same, 19. 8%, 20%, 20%, and 80%, probably. So, this ratio is not very big, there is not a big difference.

The first is that the growth of the Japanese region was very significant in the year 2023, and that was the growth of the Japanese region. The Japanese region included the old customers, the new customers also joined, so the Japanese region, the largest customer, he accounted for a high proportion, has not been able to press him down. This is not a bad thing, who grew up with the customer, who saw the other second third largest customer, how fast they grew up.

The first one is that my silica gel products, silica gel products now account for about 7% of all revenue, and now there is a large proportion or long-term, more than a long-day, two weeks throw this more, the day throws this more or less. This situation is expected to let us grow with this silica gel product, which will allow us to these regions, these customers, it will be scattered, this is one of the strategy. And of course, the second is that we have been looking for this new product in each region, this speed has not changed, this process has not changed, but the last one is that we have been looking for the second half of 2025, the United States, the United States, the United States.

So if this tax is more important, for the development of the United States, the resistance will be larger, that is, to spend more time, which is less conducive to the strategic direction of the dispersed customers, this will take more time. But if this is not related, the United States wants to pay more taxes, I have no way, so we do it. So, to conclude, the focus is on our growth this year, the bigger driver is from Japan and Europe, this is more definite and great.

The company's capacity, now at the beginning of this year, you can see that at the beginning of this year, about 105 million months of capacity, so that at the end of the year will be located in 115 million months of such capacity, it is likely to expand linearly, see the revenue gradually grow, linear growth, so the expansion of capacity will probably do so.

I made this new collection order, then I go to sin, there is a bad customer, and the last force will be a project that I become less competitive, so it's not good. So I've been keeping this in the 80% way. Of course, it's not about every quarter, every year can be like I want, I'm able to keep it like 8 times, sometimes a little different, but we'll try to do it.

So this capacity. It expands linearly. It is the area where the capacity expands. It is the area of the focus of the capacity expansion. It will be in Tashee. Tashee is a new factory.

The new equipment goes to the inside. There are products that make water repellent. That's how this utilization has always been. Its output will continue to be more and more.

The other is the Vietnam factory. The Vietnam factory is still in the present. The cover factory is still in that. The product facilities. So now it is expected to be 26 years.

The time of the year with you can be mass production. So look at the progress. I have the factory covered. After I get the equipment in. What I want to do is the certification of the product. So that time must be counted together.

This is what I said. I may be 26 years old at the end of my life. That time can really be mass production. It's time for mass production. It's OK. We cover the main purpose of the Vietnam plant.

Because I have never stressed China's factory with you. Although there is a small factory in China, I have not stressed China's factory, because we will consider. I want to avoid the risk of geopolitics.

All of my products are now in Taiwan. It is a risk. Our oil factory. There is a factory in Malaysia. There are factories elsewhere. They are more likely to avoid the risk of geopolitics.

There is only one small factory in China. Then I want to avoid this risk. The strategy I take is that I build a new factory in Vietnam. The factory.

This is not just for the sake of its use, it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use; it is for the sake of its use.

So far, China hasn't done anything to limit Taiwan. That is to say, don't let this contact lens sell to China. It hasn't done so yet. But this long line.

It's always a risk, so I'd rather be able to diversify my production base. That Vietnam is the place we've chosen, so it's not going to slow it down, it's not going to change that direction.

It's always been covered. It's capacity expansion. It's a number of capacity expansions. It's a combination of that capacity expansion. It's going to cost me a lot of money this year.

About half of that is larger. Almost half of the equipment that is located in the West Bank is in the West Bank. Purchase equipment or expand the production of the equipment. This money is spent here. The other part is spent in this Vietnam plant.

Vietnam factory we also have a lot of that product equipment. This is not a production equipment. It is a production equipment. Production equipment may be burned. By the end of the 26th century.

This is the first time I've seen this, and I'm going to have to go through this, so there's also a capital expense there, and this is probably going to cost about 15 billion dollars in this area. This is the configuration of capacity.

There are a few other issues that everyone is concerned about. It is obvious that the outlook behind China is not good. This is because it is related to the fact that we are now competing in this industry. Everyone is now conservative about China.

Then you can feel the first half of the year. You are optimistic about China's demand for growth. Then you declare that our peers have greatly expanded their productivity. This is probably going to slow down, and then China's expectations are abandoned.

I'm going to Japan, I'm going to Japan, I'm going to Japan, I'm going to Japan, I'm going to Japan, what's that?

That is to say, competition is always there in every region. You have to compete in Japan. We really are. The first thing we can't avoid. People say that China can't go wrong. They have to go to Japan to compete.

I can't do that either. It's going to happen. It's going to be a competition in Japan. It's an advantage for us. That's where I've been. demonstrate my quality.

For many years, this area has been the area of Japan. It is more important to the quality of the quality, so you have to build up your fear in there.

You are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them, but you are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them, and you are afraid of them.

Wear it. Your eyes don't burn. It's not red. It's like that. It's your market share. It's so easy in China.

But in Japan, that is, you have to take time. So everyone is on a fair basis, competing with each other, so this is probably no problem.

This is a battle between good and evil; this is a battle between good and evil; this is a battle between good and evil.

This is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the wicked is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the wicked is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the righteous is the reward of the righteous.

I'm here in China. My revenue has grown almost nothing. My revenue has declined in 2024, so basically here in China. Our progress is better. I think my product.

My quality. I can support prices like this. I can give a certain degree of this market rate. There is no relationship. That's the case. I can keep my gross profit margin.

That said, the long line is better. So I have enough gross margin. The firm's resilience. The company's resistance to this economic change. It will also be a bit better.

So we made it to the end of the season, and we made it to the end of the season.

Let's take a look at this, this is a long-term strategy.

The question that I often ask is, because you look at the price, on the performance of this sector, all of the industry's price, you probably feel that this is already a high-speed growth period, so we don't have much interest in this industry, the evaluation is low, it looks like this. This question will say that the first time will not grow at a high speed, the second new product where, my principle, the rapid growth will look at the period, if already said, with a month's revenue like this, this machine is a lot higher, so I want to grow after a year, this is not easy, but I can honestly talk to you, but steady 10%, this is OK, this is OK, this is based on the new product, what the new product is, the front of the new product, see the fine glue, probably not much, because a lot, because a lot of new product, you can hear, so you can talk about it is a lot, but a lot, so it is a lot, so it is a lot, so we do a lot, so it is a lot, so it is a lot, so we do a lot.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence must be kept as it is, but needs to be rearranged in the format of the paragraphs that are readable.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the general structure and topic of the content. It looks like this section mainly discusses revenue growth, exchange rate impact, litigation compensation, and price adjustment strategies. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical paragraph in order to make reasonable segmentation. For example, the first part of the sentence about revenue growth and exchange rate impact should be classified into paragraphs.

In the process of segmentation, I need to ensure that no sentences are missing and that the order of the original sentence is maintained. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp and ensure that the sentence timestamps within each paragraph are coherent. If there is a large part of the timestamp jump, it may be necessary to check if it belongs to the same paragraph or if it is necessary to segmentation.

In addition, the user mentions "not to delete any sentences", so it is necessary to keep everything, including duplicated or seemingly redundant parts. For example, the parts about exchange rate predictions are mentioned many times 29. 5 and 30, which need to be retained and arranged in paragraphs properly. During the process, some of the connections between sentences are not smooth enough, but according to the user's request, can not be rewritten, can only keep the original sentences. Therefore, it may be necessary to separate the sentences by appropriate punctuation or space to make them easier to read in paragraphs.

The following is the collated paragraph verbatim transcript: [1808. 90-1811. 90] will still grow more than last year's revenue. [1811. 90-1814. 90] But the extent of the growth. [1814. 90-1817. 90] You can catch a little lower in your heart. [1817. 90-1820. 90] I will definitely be cut off by the exchange rate. [1820. 90-1823. 90] will be offset by a portion of the exchange rate.

[1823. 90-1826. 90] How much do you want to calculate the exchange rate. [1826. 90-1827. 90] This. [1827. 90-1829. 90] The first we think. [1829. 90-1830. 90] We are in this industry. [1830. 90-1832. 90] Now it's about the average. [1832. 90-1835. 90] It's probably the second half of the year.

[1835. 90-1837. 90] Everyone grabs this. [1837. 90-1840. 90] There are some pessimistic views on the market. [1840. 90-1843. 90] is grab 28. 5. [1843. 90-1845. 90] The earlier there are 26. [1845. 90-1848. 90] It's just a chat. [1848. 90-1850. 90] It's not right.

[1850. 90-1851. 90] I don't think so. [1851. 90-1854. 90] It's not going to be 28. [1854. 90-1857. 90] It's about to catch 29 to 30. [1857. 90-1860. 90] It's about to catch 29.

[1866. 90-1869. 90] Falling handicap is likely to fall here. [1869. 90-1871. 90] Risk is here. [1878. 90-1881. 90] The first quarter is one. [1881. 90-1888. 90] A manufacturer. [1888. 90-1893. 90] Is the manufacturer of which they built the Taihei field. [1893. 90-1897. 90] Because I have talked about Taihei field for many years.

[1897. 90-1899. 90] [1899. 90-1902. 90] is now in mass production. [1902. 90-1906. 90] This is because there are some disputes between the builders. [1906. 90-1908. 90] They are slow. [1908. 90-1911. 90] This is the one. [1911. 90-1914. 90] Later, they go to court with him.

[1914. 90-1916. 90] The lawsuit was also long. [1916. 90-1918. 90] After a long time. [1918. 90-1921. 90] He paid some in the first quarter. [1921. 90-1924. 90] is the compensation. [1924. 90-1927. 90] This is a one-time payment. [1927. 90-1931. 90] He will not continue to pay this compensation.

[1941. 90-1943. 90] Q. [1943. 90-1945. 90] The value of the dollar is like this. [1945. 90-1947. 90] When we can increase. [1947. 90-1948. 90] The function of the price. [1948. 90-1950. 90] How long we can do it. [1950. 90-1953. 90] I think the price.

[1955. 90-1956. 90] Unless. [1956. 90-1959. 90] Unless I think 2026. [1959. 90-1961. 90] Taiwan Dollar will continue to rise in value. [1961. 90-1965. 90] Otherwise, I really don't have a position to talk to the customer. [1965. 90-196. 90] Talk about this. [1965. 90-196. 90] This is because this is a lot of aspects.

[1968. 90-1970. 90] That is to say. [1970. 90-1973. 90] My central thinking. [1973. 90-1974. 90] My central strategy. [1974. 90-1977. 90] That is what I hope I will go. [1977. 90-1979. 90] To keep the price flat. [1979. 90-1980. 90] Not to raise the price.

[1980. 90-1983. 90] That is, it is never talk about price reduction. [1983. 90-1985. 90] But look at the customer. [1985. 90-1987. 90] If you look at. [1987. 90-1990. 90] Look at Japanese customers. [1990. 90-1991. 90] Japanese customers. [1991. 90-1996. 90] Japanese yen now has a slight appreciation trend.

[1996. 90-1999. 90] But its long line does not appear to rise or rise. [1999. 90-2001. 90] The second half of the year will not rise a little bit. [2001. 90-2002. 90] The first half of the year is not. [2002. 90-2005. 90] It is 150 this side. [2005. 90-2007. 90] So it's 150 here. [2007. 90-2009. 90] I really don't.

[2009. 90-2011. 90] There is no perspective. [2011. 90-2013. 90] I can talk to Japanese customers. [2013. 90-2015. 90] I want to stop subsidies for this matter. [2015. 90-2016. 90] So the first. [2016. 90-2018. 90] Subsidies for Japanese customers. [2018. 90-2019. 90] will continue.

[2019. 90-2022. 90] The price will be flat. [2022. 90-2023. 90] Because the Japanese Yen is not large. [2023. 90-2025. 90] Japanese Yen vs. Taiwan Dollar. [2025. 90-2026. 90] or Japanese Yen vs. US Dollar. [2026. 90-2022. 90] It does not have this significant change. [2028. 90-2023. 90] It is for customers in other regions.

[2033. 90-2036. 90] That's really me. [2036. 90-2038. 90] Unless I see the back of the dollar. [2038. 90-2041. 90] The real way will go up. [2041. 90-2042. 90] And I'll have to rise. [2042. 90-2045. 90] For example, I'm really up to 28 now. [2045. 90-2046. 90] I'll have the bottom line at this time.

[2046. 90-2048. 90] Let's talk to the customer. [2048. 90-2051. 90] I want to talk about the price. [2051. 90-2052. 90] I want to talk about the price. [2052. 90-2054. 90] I see the time. [2054. 90-2055. 90] See if we are in the same industry. [2055. 90-2057. 90] We are not satisfied.

[2057. 90-2058. 90] This part is not safe. [2058. 90-2061. 90] This is a very interesting question. [2064. 90-2066. 90] That is. [2068. 90-2071. 90] Within the entire cooperative group. [2058. 90-2074. 90] From time to time, this is done.

[2074. 90-2077. 90] A safe haven for forward foreign exchange. [2077. 90-2079. 90] This is a group. [2079. 90-2081. 90] A custom of a company. [2081. 90-2083. 90] This custom. [2083. 90-2087. 90] That. [2087. 90-2091. 90] is the entire group requiring all its subsidiaries.

[2091. 90-2094. 90] You should focus on your business. [2094. 90-2096. 90] Do not imagine all day. [2096. 90-2099. 90] Make money from the exchange rate. [2099. 90-2102. 90] Because you are easy to guess. [2102. 90-2104. 90] When you guess correctly. [2104. 90-2105. 90] You are happy.

[2105. 90-2106. 90] Toe high. [2106. 90-2107. 90] This financial show. [2107. 90-2109. 90] You think it did something right. [2109. 90-2111. 90] But you do it ten times. [2111. 90-2113. 90] You may only do it twice. [2113. 90-2114. 90] Right.

[2114. 90-2116. 90] Most of the time it is wrong. [2116. 90-2117. 90] So this group is inside. [2117. 90-2119. 90] Don't do that. [2119. 90-2121. 90] You can do your best. [212121. 90-2122. 90] Be an engine mirror. [2122. 90-2123. 90] You are an engine mirror.

[2123. 90-2124. 90] Sell the engine mirror to make money. [2124. 90-2126. 90] Don't do that anymore. [2126. 90-2128. 90] Your mind is talking. [2128. 90-2131. 90] I'll always make this product better. [2131. 90-2135. 90] This is a long line habit. [2135. 90-2138. 90] But short line.

[2138. 90-2140. 90] The short line is divided into two parts. [2140. 90-2141. 90] For example, the previous month. [2141. 90-2143. 90] The previous week. [2143. 90-2147. 90] The dollar has been raised a dollar for two days. [2147. 90-2149. 90] It is a matter of fact. [2149. 90-2150. 90] The one we cannot.

[2150. 90-2151. 90] As soon as you rise. [2158. 90-2115. 90] We have no means of making money. [2153. 90-2155. 90] The bank does not follow me. [2155. 90-2156. 90] There is no way. [2156. 90-2158. 90] There is no way. [2158. 90-2160. 90] It is the middle.

[2160. 90-2161. 90] I am assuming now. [2161. 90-2164. 90] I know this second half of the year. [2160. 90-2161. 90] I am sick.

So, you will see that the electronic industry here or the carrier industry now that we talk about the reasons for the rise in prices is the raw material, I use the reason is not that the exchange rate is easy for the customer to fight. The next season you do not want to come back, but we have no way to talk about this reason, this reason is not good enough. But the market in China at the time was also the same, because when the economic downturn will not be the case, it is said that the original use of the day was changed to two weeks, the change of the month of the month, this situation will affect the market, and this thing has happened.

So the difference between that feeling is that it's not going to feel like it's going to go away at any time or that there's no more specific way in which he's doing what I'm trying to push the water repellent product well that's what you said right now, I'm not even expecting that.

And he said to them, "Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, and it springs forth, and it springs forth, and it springs forth, and it does not cease."

And he said to them, "Behold, I am about to die; behold, I am about to die; behold, I am about to die; behold, I am about to die; behold, I am about to die; behold, I am not about to die."

I am not going to do that. I am not. I am a personal factor because I used to use gold lock contact lenses. Then I changed to a water-repellent glue.

The start is amazing. The part of the contact lens is. It's not quite clear. The water vapour is really clear, but I think it came down to this.

No, I've been using a water repellent gel, but I think this is the case right now. It's like restoring and bringing a water repellent.

I don't know why. I'm going to tell you one thing. That's actually what it's all about. Water repellent is better than water repellent. It's a business language, but because 90% of people believe it.

My own vision. The cornea. The character of that is stronger. All of my possessions. My bardo can be on my cornea. Not on my eyes.

I just want to exceed that value. In fact, there is no difference. Why do I feel the difference? Because it absorbs the glue. It can do a bit thin. If I do well.

The edge was flat, smooth, and smooth. I didn't wear any foreign feeling. I thought it was helpful. That's it, plus you're from Europe and America.
