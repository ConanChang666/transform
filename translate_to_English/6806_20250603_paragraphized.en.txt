It is also part of the north side of Zhang, and we are still in operation on November 11, 2020, and the efficiency of the power generation is very good. Next, let's talk about offshore wind power, and I believe that this is a case that everyone is very concerned about. This case is a contract capacity of 300MW, he was on June 15, 2020, the current date of completion or the 31 December 2025.

This is the part of the underwater piles that we have built on the sea. The only thing that I have to say is that it is the part of the submarine, which is the part of the green electricity trading. I think it's quite a bit of a reminiscent of it: he's reworked 382 points, which has already provided 4,800 kW, the main customer, of course, the electronic industry, Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Gangdeda, these Honghai, and the Sunlight Group. The integrated device capacity includes solar, green wind, and a total of 29.2 MW.

This is our new shore, we all give comrades reference to the industry, including Dongdaemun, Yilan Dongdaemun, and the last one is a shore in the land of Taoyuan. Finally, we report on our ESG activities, which means that social workers and technical staff are not afraid of rain and rain, and continue to participate in our beach clean-up activities. Next, we also participated in the National Property Agency on March 12th, and he organized a nationalization of land in the local carbon spring demonstration area, which is expected to have 71.98 hectares of state-owned land in the Taitung pool, we will plant about 13,000 trees, which will promote Taiwan's first large-scale natural carbon will license the new shore, which is to achieve a voluntary reduction project in Taiwan's land.

On April 22, the World Earth Day, social workers and technology subsidiary Yuanshan Forest also actively responded to the New Taipei City Government's initiative to plant a million million trees for the Earth on April 22. We hope to be able to promote the planting of trees as a global movement, become the next sustainable seed of the Taiwanese society, let us internationalize. Finally, we still want to signal that our social staff is a concept of an ESG industry ecosystem, which is what we call an energy-saving, energy-saving, energy-saving, energy-saving and green electricity trading platform.
