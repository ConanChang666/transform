That's why we can do Rec and Manifold, do QD, and do different types of CDU. That's why when liquid cools, we become a Total Solution is a liquid solution provider. In fact, this liquid can be for everyone, for us, we have been farming very much, at least 12 years. This can be traced back to 2012, the company continues to do so from IBM, and continues to transfer the technology of this liquid energy.

Well, this is our company's product history. We mainly started from Notebook, OK, then back to VGA, Smartphone, Server, Automotive and Liquid Cooling. So you can see that the company in the past 25 years, 2025, 25, 26 years, every 3 to 5 years, the company will enter a new market, a new segment, and even upgrade to new technology. Well, that's our company's production line, our company's production base is Chongqing, Kunshan, Guangzhou, Hefei, okay, there's another Thailand.

That's why some of our customers, especially CSP customers, want us to do the work of the server, CSP customers, so he wants us to further diversify the production of a new line, then we choose Thailand. Well, so we're in Thailand right now because it's not because we're there because we're going to have a tariff problem, in fact, we started to layout there early in 2020. OK, that's our new headquarters. Well, then here is a little bit of this map we should see, in fact, it's basically what we're going to talk about why water is needed, and how to use liquid energy. So you can see the part of the vertical axis it's writing power, so each CPU, GPU it has power, we call the TDP Thermal Design, the power.

We don't say that we just want to use HeatPipe or Vampire Tramper VC to put the fin on top of this chip, to give this heat guide, and then to blow through the fan. This HeatSync is like this, this is 3D VC, this is used when Hopper is H100. That's when your chip is placed below, you'll use the fan outside, you're not only going to get the result it's automatically cooled, you just give it heat it's thermal conductor, the heat component of course is to use the fan to disperse, that is to blow the fin.

You can see that the higher the wattage, the higher the number of the EU, and even a little later you can actually go down to our downstairs boost to see, we now have 6EU to 8EU, that is, some chips, but you can imagine that this 6EU to 8EU really takes up a lot of space. Well, of course, the water is cold, that is, the copper, that is, you are inside a EU of a Chassis. Well, that is, if you guide Liquid Cooling, you can increase your unit, your computing power, your unit area of computing power, that is that you can increase your Computing Power per Sqft.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. Next, I need to group these sentences according to logical and contextual relationships to form a coherent paragraph. For example, the PoE and water-cooled sections may need to be merged into one paragraph, while the financial data section may be separate. It is important to note that the user mentioned "permanent verbatim verbs" may mean that each sentence is independent, but the actual conversion needs to be semanticly linked to them. For example, the sentence "timestamps" is "that your computational density may be elevated" may be associated with the next "good that is," so you need to put them in the same paragraph. At the same time, make sure not to miss any sentences, including duplicate or seem redundant.

For example, if we use PoE and Power Usage Efficiency many times, we need to keep it as it is. In addition, note that technical terms such as "PoE", "Liquid Cooling", etc., for the correct processing, maintain professionalism. During the processing process, some sentence structures may be loosened or spoken, such as "good so that this is also the money", which requires to keep the spoken expression of the original sentence without any modification. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, consistent with the process of speech or discussion. Finally, check the paragraph-length transcription after the whole conversion to ensure that all sentences are correctly categorized without omissions or errors. Make sure that each paragraph is carried around a topic such as technical discussion, product presentation, financial data, so that the reader can clearly follow the content development.

The following is a paragraph type transcription after finishing:. The density of your computing power will be increased. Well, there is PoE. Because we know that the density of water is higher than the air, it is actually more efficient to take away the heat of this chip. Well, so if we use PoE Power Usage Efficiency to use efficiency, the water will be cold.

Well, the liquid-cooled PoE can go down to 1.1, 1.2 1.1 or less, and even some air-cooled 1.1 or less. Well, so the difference between this and that is, if I were to dilute the liquid-cooled Liquid Cooling, I could add my own could be Cold Structure, which is like what we say is the Power Consumption we can save about 30%-40%. Well, that's what we're talking about, that's what we're talking about, that's what we're talking about, and that's why we're talking about Power Consumption, which is really important.

As you can see, this is the part of total solution, you can see that this is Rake and Manipal, we all welcome our BOOST on the first floor of J0106, you can see that there are many things you can see there is Rake and Manipal behind the cabinet, and then this is Rake, this is the building manipal we first exhibited for AMD NVIDIA Intel different solutions, then we even did ASIC Coplay and ASIC solution, but the part of the ASIC did not show because it was customized. Well, then we did do QD Quick Connector, and then CDU differentLiquid to Air or Liquid Ray, we can do this, where you have to see the green Mark hook, it is whether we have entered the NV RDL or into the RDL.

It's already 17% of total revenue. Well, it's mostly water cooled down. Then there are other product portfolio optimizations. Our OPEX is probably about 6.4% of the absolute amount. So if you invest in advanced, you'll want to know how to use this OPEX. We also recommend that you grab it with an absolute number, possibly around 6,5 billion.

We are just OPEX Ratio, of course, with the growth of revenue, we hope that it can go to 13, then to 13, then to 12, this way our industry, this first quarter of this year, we have exchange income, the exchange profit is about 12.5%, then we have about 6,7 million. Our EPS is about 5.66. Well, that's our part, that's a little added to OPEX's Ratio, why OPEX is, and why it's the first quarter, is about 6.400 million. The main reason is because it's really not fancy, the part of the pipeline extension.

The PoDM service is 44%, then the PC is 35%, then the VGA is 17%, and then the Other is 14%. In this service, we can actually go to the point, and we just talk about our entire Liquid Cooling, which accounts for about 17% in the first quarter of this year. That compared to the fourth quarter, which is about 8 percent in the last quarter.

Well 23 years is 2 Percent, then 24 years is 12 Percent. That's 25 years, this year's credit is 40 to 50 Percent of total revenue Liquid Cooling, because you want to think, when we're in the air, we're pure component maker, but I'm cool, because apart from content value increase, I'm not only doing Coplay, I also do Rack Manifold, Inner Manifold, QQT, I can do total solution, so I can get, I can be able to generate a lot of content value.

The CSP customers are the CSP customers, mainly the U.S. Ca individual, then Enterprise is not the Super Michael DLHP NANOVO, these Enterprise customers. So the revenue ratio in the last year 2024, our CSP customers, Server in CSP customers, about 7 percent, and Enterprise accounted for 3 percent. That said, because before the PC, we would divide our PC into Gaming, Commercial, Consumer. So Gaming and Commercial accounted for about 75 Percent of the entire PC.

Then, you look at others 24 and 25 years, from 5 percent will fall to 2 percent. In fact, others is also growing, but others is mainly because we still do a smartphone before 2024, but after 25 years, this is not our main focus on the place. So 25 years ago, we actually smartphone, 25 years ago, others will be mainly cars. Well, then this is our company in the new year, we used to pay out of the past is the part of Dibbon.

This is the first part of our book, and the first part of our book is the first part of the book, and the second part is the first part of the book.

The question can be raised, then we wait a little while to pick up the microphone for you, so that online investment friends can hear your question clearly. So now Q&A links, are there any investment advanced wanted to ask questions, or media friends want to ask questions? Is there any relevant questions to ask? If not, I would like to ask you first, because I just mentioned that this year, the portion of liquid cooling will be about 45% of the revenue.

This is the first time that we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, and we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, so we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, but we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, so we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, so we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, and we have been to Thailand since the beginning of the year, so we have been to Thailand since the end of the year.

If you want to do this, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it. If you want to do it, you can do it.

The first question is whether we can answer the first question is whether the Chinese factory in China, the Chinese factory in China, or the Chinese factory in China, and you don't have to worry about saying that the capacity will be idle because I said that these things could be either coplay or gas, the main raw material of copper, or the raw material of copper, or the main mainland China. In Southeast Asia, you say that this is not the source of this mineral resource, and you go there to buy the copper in China, and we will do something in China, and then we will send it to Thailand.

There is also another existing customer. His AXIC potential also needs to cool down the water. But it should be at the time of next year.

I'm going to add another question to this one. Because today's new currency is going to be a bit faster than today's one. It's going to be a second word. So it's going to be a bit more shocking. Now, if you're going to slow down, then we're going to have a huge impact on the gross profit margin.

We can't share it with you. Because we can also be a bit better at the premium power of a leading manufacturer. Gross interest rate is probably at the end of the word. So we're slowly trying to adjust the impact of gross profit rate on the second half of the year. If we say that gross profit rate is normal, our company is a natural hedge.

Our company bought and picked up US dollars and then the raw materials were mainly denominated in US dollars. So this piece is probably at least half of it is a natural safe haven. But there are still some effects. Finally, there will be some effects. So you can say that the impact of April will be more severe. Then it may be because it is not so volatile.

It's really good. So we're going to see it on our own in April because although there are a lot of financial implications, the figures aren't coming up yet, but we're going to see it ourselves because in the second quarter, we're actually better than in the first quarter.

Because water cold is a constant increase in penetration. So it may not be as good as it used to be. Your product portfolio has limited space. There is no way to cover some of these negative exchange rates or the same price.

Because our product portfolio is continuously optimized. It may not be as significant as it is for the optimisation of our product portfolio. But at least I think this is the moment. It affects our margin as it was before. Or the appreciation of the dollar affects our margin. I don't think it will be that time.

This is how the two of them got hurt. This time will not see such a thing. OK. That's OK. That's because the relationship between the time. If you have any other problems with the investment, you can't say anything else.

We would like to thank Mr. Chen for his warm applause. Thank you for your time. We will be back for the rest of the day. The next time is a performance lookout. We will start at 10:40 in the morning. Thank you all.

Good morning to our guests. Today we are going to have our second session. It is a speech by Xiangshu science and technology. Some prospects for the success of Xiangshu science and technology. There is also a Q&A link. And it is the same as before.

A company will have 30 minutes. For the first 20 minutes, we will ask Hsiaoshu for a briefing on the business. Then there will be some financial and future development trends.

And of course, remember to use the microphone, because we are online. There are other online audience friends who also want to hear this kind of problem.

When you introduce yourself, you can say hello first. Invited by Zhang Peixuan, the investor relations manager of Xiangshu Technology. Well, then the event will be officially started. We asked Theresa to go on stage.

Thank you very much. All the legal persons came to the scene. It was also a great thank you to SSE and the illegal people for giving us such an opportunity. I would like to share with you some more information about our company here.

Well, let me first briefly introduce our company since its inception. So far, it's a simple process. The success of our company was created in 2004. At that time, the turnover was about $30 million. The staff was about 70 people.

The main product at that time was this digital photo frame. That's because the product was very competitive at that time. It was also very hot. So it came in 2008. We found some changes in the market situation. At that time, our general manager was Mr. Lin.

Also. was assigned to Xiangshu to serve as a startup office. He and the management of the company decided to make a transformation for our company. That would be to reposition our company's products and strategies.

By 2012, we had a turnover of 1. 6 billion yuan. We were also successfully listed at the end of the year in Taiwan's stock market. That's what we saw today. If we had our revenue in 2024, we had reached 8 billion yuan. Our products were mainly focused on this high speed service.

That's high-speed technology related to these transmissions. For example, USB PCIE SATA. Then we have some ASIC projects. That number of employees has reached more than 300. That's because we're actually an IC design company. So most of our resources are still invested in RD-related human resources.

So we can see that our RD share is about 80% or more. Our current headquarter is also a new store in Taiwan. With this market cap, our figure at the end of the first quarter is about 130 billion Taiwan dollars.

Our technology starts with the actual implementation of USB. Whether it is in host or device, it is the first product in the world to launch such a product. It is also certified by this USB association. It is part of such a technology. We can see this advantage. It has been extended to the 20G and 40G part of this USB.

Next, I'm going to explain a few more things about this product. Because I want investors to know more about the application of our company's actual products. How can I see what parts of our products are on the market. So let's take a look at this mid-range product. Most of the things are actually on desktop PC related applications. Especially in this high-end workstation.

It's a relatively small amount on the laptop, and it's because our stuff is actually on the motherboard, so we have to have enough space to put some extra chips.

There are IPCs as well.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, converting them from a verbatim format to a paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original text must be maintained.

First of all, I read through the entire transcription fragment to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this is an introduction to the company's products and technologies, involving technical details such as PC, storage, USB, PCIe, SATA, as well as market strategy and future planning. Next, I need to merge these concluding entries into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the original order and content of each sentence.

Also, be careful of logical connections between sentences to ensure that paragraphs are smooth. For example, when referring to the USB host and device, it may be necessary to merge the relevant sentences to make it easier for readers to understand. At the same time, pay attention to duplicate sentences, such as "in fact, we are all slowly going to this" appear twice, but may be merged into the same paragraph. It is also necessary to check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all entries are properly converted. For example, the user's verbs have some timestamps that may be wrong or duplicated, such as [3139. 98-3140. 98][3140. 98][3140. 98][3142. 98] and 3140. 98] need to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraphs.

At the same time, check if there is a format error or notation problem, to ensure the final result is clear and easy to read. </think> The following is the converted paragraph verbatim script (totally retain all the original sentences, only reorganized paragraphs by semantic logic):-- We have this product inside. So see is part of this computer, we are mainly in the host, and the host is on this motherboard.

We have a lot of things to do here. The above is a middle-level product, so let's take a look at the next part of this technology to explain it. Because we have heard more and detailed related terms, maybe USB a PCIe or SATA, so how do we explain our company's technology and products? Basically, if we look at this technology, the USB controller will divide it into three parts.

This is a very important part of our business. The other part is probably some smaller chips, such as Redriver or Mux, and some of the other ones like DisplayPort. We have integrated them into our U4 solution. So you can see, the best technology is this one from the very old U4 solution, 5G 10G 20G, and now the 40G USB 40G. We are all going to take a step back and do this step further.

So in order to make all devices available, you have to slow down to start doing it, and then accumulate some know-how, whether it is in software or hardware, there is a way to do it. So I think this part will be one of the major competitive advantages of the company, it will take time to accumulate, not so easy to replace it. Then we will talk about the company's products, as well as the market strategy.

In addition to this, this is a relatively stable market, but in fact, there are some for Creators, there are many more high-level applications, such as those of Workstation, to push our part of this business with growth. In addition to this, there are some ASIC business, which actually owns us a very large proportion of revenue, so I think here mainly or because of our own technology, there is a way to go to Full Build customer demand, so there is a way to maintain a good business. In addition to this, there is a need for some high-speed data transfer, so in addition to this, there is a more advanced is some data transfer or storage, some of the related data management, like Secure some of which we currently have a part of pondering.

This is where we can find some higher value in the product, even some premium, etc. What we actually see here is that this year we have this USB4, which began to mass production last year, this year the penetration rate is still low, then some of the related applications, whether it is AIL or the whole gaming, the overall privateization, there is also a performance requirement, some of the related components will actually be upgraded, so here we see the potential U4 penetration will be more and more. In addition to the U4 40G this part, we are next to prepare this 80G product, which is for the next U4 upgrade needs.

This is the most important thing, because we see some different development in the market, or more development, so we also began the development of this AIPC, we began to re-engineer our own strategy, to find a more favorable direction of development, which will be more than our past market growth rate. It will be divided into three parts, the first is AI, the second is the car, the third is some comparison of the Niche Market part. The second is the RTX for Automotive application, which is more related to what we have done this year or the year before.

The other part is the part of Niche Market, or some Premium Market, because it is a very important part of our business strategy in the past, that is, we would like to focus on some products that are relatively high value-added, such as IPC or some advanced storage related applications, will also be some of our focus direction. In fact, we can see here, that is, we are in the evolution of technology, or the process of upgrading specifications, in fact, will lead to the increase in revenues and profits, then we have since 2012 IPO, and so far we have a lot of revenue increase, then at the bottom can see that we have a lot of this development time, we have to do with our new technology, so we have to do with USA, we have to be the first in Taiwan, so we can maintain a very good level, that this is to reflect the competitiveness of our products.

Of course, it may not be easy for me to go to a single customer, but I think that our current ASIC-related projects account for more than 50% of revenue is not wrong.

So we look at the overall business of this year we are very positive about this part of the product. That is, in addition to the ASIC product, because the related high-end products will also be related to our own brand host UFO host, so I think the UFO host part of this part can also contribute some more good revenue. OK, we have to back up that is our retriever part of the ASIC customer, because now a lot of customers in the ASIC product, because now we pay attention to this cost, what are our strategies can be design win these ASIC customers? retriever This product is because it is relatively much more competitive, so the company's strategy will compare Focus on the controller, because we think that choosing to fit some of our market and direction, may be more beneficial, so the retriever here may not be much in the short term.

Theresa can be said to say, because it just mentioned that the big customer looks very good this year, so now that it is the customer's visibility, is it really the third quarter from the increase in revenue, can it still maintain as strong as the second quarter? Then it is to say that the help for gross margin, because UFO's host actually has some contribution, so to ask whether there is an update on gross margin, maybe this range, thank you. Yes, because we may not be too easy to do this in terms of this number, but in terms of trends, I think we should look good in the first three quarters of this year, mainly because of the ASIC's relationship with this project, I think it should be worth looking forward to.

Is there a plan for the future of mergers and acquisitions? What is the possible direction? Thank you. We will focus on these projects first, so there will be no new plans in the short term. Do we have plans for the accident in this industry?

This is why we have collected some questions here to ask, because in addition to some of the PAC switches of the PCIE, there is actually a USB part, but today we have gathered some questions to ask. That is, we may see in the consumer end of the year, we just mentioned the AIPC part of the lot, in fact, there is a lot of notebooks, Desktop part is actually gaming part, but in the second half of this year, we seem to be a little conservative, so how do we think we look at this part of the PC market and the desktop market is relatively stable, but our business is really good at the beginning of the year, so this is mainly because some changes in the customer market share, it is a better direction to go, so we think this trend should be more positive, so this year's the whole operation direction, we think that the last three seasons should be a good state, because it may actually involve a bit of the end of the customer's a bit of stocking in the end.

Theresa asked me about the PCIE Switch, because Sample is ready to do it, so can I update it? You can update with us, for example, the table target time, and Sample Revenue time. Yes, this part of the time, I think the output should still maintain a little bit of the view, that our current Sample is expected to send in the second half of the year, then there will be some revenue contribution, but this part should be relatively small, if it is our mass production part, usually customers receive samples to mass production time, about a year, because our mass production time, the time range is about 9 to 12 months, so if it is smooth, we also want to see a corresponding time, can see such a contribution, then the next generation of Package Switch, should be more than this generation, about a little later.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: [5165. 98-5195. 96] Mirror and Dot column. [5195. 98-5202. 66] Mirror and Dot column. [5202. 66-5225. 96] Mirror and Dot column. [5225. 98-5229. 60] This is the next stage of our development. [5229. 60-5231. 74] Edge AI is a good foundation.

[5231. 74-5233. 14] So included in the CPU. [5233. 14-5234. 74] High-performance low-power CPU. [5234. 74-5236. 62] Included in NPU. [5236. 62-5239. 38] Run these AI compute on top of NPU. [5239. 38-5242. 02] We have a generation of new technologies. [5242. 02-5244. 18] New product launches.

[5244. 18-5245. 02] For example. [5245. 02-5246. 68] In the second half of last year. [5246. 68-5248. 32] On this side of the flagship phone. [5248. 32-5249. 80] We launched the Nintendo 9400. [5249. 80-5251. 86] Our latest flagship platform. [5251. 86-5254. 46] Also received good market feedback.

[5254. 46-5257. 10] At this year's CES. [5257. 10-5258. 36] We also announced. [5258. 36-5261. 30] Co-developed design with NVIDIA. [5261. 30-5262. 86] This super-chip GB10. [5262. 86-5266. 30] is now used on NVIDIA's supercomputers. [5266. 30-5268. 10] DGS Spark above.

[5268. 10-5270. 06] Let us know if you are interested. [5270. 06-5270. 78] If you are interested in our booth. [5270. 78-5273. 26] We also exhibit this product on our booth. [5273. 26-5276. 52] That's why it's shown in MediaTek. [5276. 52-5278. 96] This means that we have some examples of high performance. [5278. 96-5282. 84]

[5282. 84-5284. 20] Of course we will not. [5284. 20-5285. 20] Only stay here. [5285. 20-5287. 42] We will continue to move forward. [5287. 42-5289. 32] On top of our boss. [5289. 32-5290. 60] On Tuesdays, Kino was mentioned. [5290. 60-5291. 26]

[5291. 24-5292. 28] We will also be moving forward. [5292. 28-5293. 44] Continue to move forward. [5293. 44-5294. 58] Takes 2nm. [5294. 58-5297. 34] Hope to move from this edge to the cloud. [5297. 34-5299. 58] Able to take all our product performance. [5299. 58-5301. 36] Can move forward.

[5301. 36-5303. 84] Then seize the opportunity of this AI. [5303. 84-5305. 30] So this is the first big spindle. [5305. 30-5306. 74] is the whole high performance. [5306. 74-5309. 04] is the unit of Computing. [5309. 04-5312. 46] Whether CPU NPU here technical capabilities. [5312. 46-5313. 64] The second we think.

[5313. 64-5315. 44] Also important thing is that [5315. 44-5319. 02] This data center is now hit in the cloud AI data center. [5319. 02-5320. 56] The technology required. [5320. 56-5321. 80] I hope you all know. [5321. 80-5321. 14] MediaTek has been working hard for years. [5324. 14-5324. 92] The opportunity here.

[5324. 92-5326. 32] Especially custom chips. [5326. 32-5328. 64] The opportunity above this data center. [5328. 64-5330. 86] So if we look at this demand for growth in this market. [5330. 86-5334. 88] This market is very fast. [5334. 88-5336. 26] That is for customers of the data center. [5336. 26-5338. 90]

[5338. 90-5341. 20] They have always wanted to reduce this one. [5341. 20-5341. 76] TCO [5341. 76-5342. 52] Total Cost of Ownership [5342. 52-5343. 64] Total Cost of Ownership [5343. 64-5345. 18] So in the process. [5345. 18-5349. 52] They also wanted to have such partners. [5349. 52-5351. 32] To help them make custom chips. [5349. 53-5354. 64] To help them reduce this whole. [5354. 86-53564. 44] TCO's cost.

[5356. 44-5358. 48] So here we have a good one. [5358. 48-5361. 56] We found this good opportunity to follow a good role. [5361. 56-5366. 42] It is the most important or IP that can support such a business model. [5366. 42-5369. 50] We have this most important service Interconnect. [5369. 50-5370. 78] The IP transmitted. [5370. 78-5373. 60] This is also the fourth floor of our booth today.

[5377. 74-5379. 80] The IP of 224G [5380. 80-5381. 84] This is our show. [5373. 84-5383. 12] We will continue to do so in the future.

[5385. 16-5386. 96] The following investments include. [5389. 96-5389. 00] 448G Service IP. [5389. 00-5389. 76] Included. [5389. 76-5392. 58] The next generation of faster this CPO. [5392. 58-5394. 38] This transfer, etc.

[5395. 92-5399. 50] This part of us also has continued to invest below. [5399. 50-5403. 08] So this is a crucial place we can help our clients. [5403. 08-5403. 60] After that. [5403. 64-5404. 16] Plus. [5404. 16-5405. 44] We work with this. [5405. 44-5408. 00] Cooperation in the global semiconductor industry chain.

[5408. 00-5409. 78] is to help customers be able to. [5409. 78-5411. 06] Advanced process. [5411. 06-5413. 12] Design capability with Advanced Package. [5413. 12-5416. 18] Next 3nm 2nm. [5416. 18-5418. 48] and then Advanced Package 2. 5D. [5418. 48-5420. 28] Package 3. 5D Package, etc.

[5420. 28-5421. 56] Design and technical capabilities. [5421. 56-5427. 20] We also have a good experience in the world with this Supply Chain. [5427. 20-5428. 98] Partners. [5428. 98-5431. 04] So this is what we are able to offer. [5431. 04-5432. 32] Some of our customers. [5432. 32-5433. 60] Strategic value.

[5433. 64-5435. 44] So this part is also true. [5435. 44-5437. 48] We now have. [5437. 48-5438. 76] This time Computex. [5438. 76-5439. 78] We also have. [5439. 78-5442. 86] This NVIDIA announced this. [5442. 86-5444. 40] NV-Link Fusion.

[5444. 40-5446. 44] is that it will be its NV-Link. [5446. 44-5448. 24] ecosystem. [5448. 24-5451. 04] Expanding we are also announcing that we are in it. [5441. 04-054542. 84] This is also one of them. [5454. 84-5454. 88] The earlier batches were put into this. [5454. 88-5455. 66] Vendors.

[5455. 66-5459. 76] We are confident that this is equivalent to more than one in our business. [5459. 76-5461. 28] More flexibility. [5461. 28-5463. 60] Solution can help our customers. [5463. 64-5465. 44] Help them reduce TCO. [5465. 44-5468. 24] So we also offer here. [5468. 24-5469. 28] Some comparisons.

[5469. 28-5470. 30] Flexible. [5470. 30-5471. 32] Business model. [5470. 30-5472. 08] That is. [5472. 08-5472. 86] Customer can. [5472. 86-5474. 14] According to their needs. [5474. 14-5474. 90] Then.

[5474. 90-5476. 44] We are in different stages. [5476. 44-5478. 48] Able to help them in time. [5478. 48-5481. 82] Created them to design this custom chip. [5481 82-5482. 84] So this. [5482. 84-5488. 48] The development of these technologies is the backbone of the second spindle we just talked about here in the cloud AI. [5488. 44-5490. 78] The accelerator above this one.

[5490. 78-5493. 60] This is also the effort of IP with various technologies. [5494. 64-5494. 40] We think. [5494. 40-5497. 48] Help us to come next in the cloud AI. [5497. 48-5500. 80] An important focus on business opportunities. [5500. 80-5502. 34] Now we speak third. [5502. 34-5504. 64] The third we think we are from.

[5504. 64-5508. 24] Edge to the middle of the cloud. [5508. 24-5509. 52] This is also very important. [5509. 52-5514. 12] Because we think we are just talking about this ability of the first computer right now. [5514. 12-5515. 66] Most are at the edge. [5515. 66-5516. 68] But the future.

[5520. 52-5522. 82] Future comparisons may be a hybrid. [5522. 82-5523. 34] Comparisons are one. [5523. 34-5524. 88] Hybrid AI. [5524. 88-5526. 42] is part of some. [5526. 42-5527. 18] Application. [5527. 18-5530. 50] Just like you and me care is a more conscious privacy.

[5530. 50-5532. 56] Relatively low latency. [5532. 56-5533. 84] Applications like this. [5533. 84-5536. 40] We may run on the device end of the phone. [5536. 40-5538. 18] But there are some more complex ones. [5538. 18-5540. 24] Or it may require a large amount of data. [5540. 24-5542. 02] Or that.

[5542. 02-5543. 82] The language model is not so big. [5543. 82-5545. 10] These applications came with handle. [5545. 10-5546. 38] Could run in the cloud. [5544. 38-5549. 70] So the middle of connectivity is important how to connect. [5549. 70-5551. 76] My Device is with this cloud. [5554. 76-5553. 30] The ability is also very important.

[5553. 34-5557. 44] MediaTek has been wireless for a long time. [5557. 44-5558. 72] This communication. [5558. 72-5561. 02] Wireless technology is connected to the network.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim text provided by the user step by step, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, to ensure that sentences in each paragraph are consistent in time. For example, on the part of industry chain and ecosystem cooperation, it may be necessary to combine multiple relevant sentences into one paragraph to demonstrate the complete cooperative content. During the process, there may be some convergence problems between sentences, such as "this network-tested by the satellite of the track" and "the vendor's chip vendor" need to be merged into a complete sentence.

In addition, pay attention to the correctness of professional terms and company names, such as "TSMC", "NVIDIA", etc., to ensure that there are no spelling errors during the conversion process. At the same time, check whether there are duplicate or redundant content, but according to the user's requirements, nothing can be deleted, so even if there is duplicated need to be retained. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read through the entire paragraph verbatim to ensure that all the original sentences are correctly arranged, no omissions or misplacements, and that the paragraphs are logically coherent between paragraphs. At the same time, check whether the format conforms to the user's requirements, such as timestamps correctly corresponds, and whether the paragraphs are clearly readable or not.

As an example at MWC this year, we also announced that we are the world's leading manufacturer of ICs capable of achieving this 5G Advanced NTN status, which is a network-tested satellite. We are now, and continue to move forward with this technology to 6G and 6G, and we believe that in the era of 6G, we will also be a leader in wireless communication. So here we have a complete layout to connect the Edge to the cloud, so this part is the third main focus of our next opportunity.

This is the fourth time we think it is important for us to cooperate with the entire industry chain and the entire ecosystem. I think that the industry chain is above us, there are many strong partners, including our long-term partner TSMC on this advanced process of development, and then there is a very complementary technology portfolio from two companies along our way with NVIDIA, so from the earliest we talked about, we have been extended to the Internet of Things to Monitor, and then to the next time I mentioned that the NV Link at Computex Announce is the collaboration of Enterprise ASIC Data Center. So such a series of collaboration also helps us to accelerate the development of the entire Edge AI to the cloud, which we believe is an important one we have been working on and continuing to invest.

So this is a comparison of our current project, I think we have more than a few times in the future, we believe we will continue to bring more revenue contribution to the company in the next few years, so it is a little bit longer. The presentation we use today is our first quarter of the conference, so we may also look a little bit more at some of our revenue share in the first quarter. In our company's products we still have a lot of external disclosure, we divide it into three, the first part is the phone, the second part is the smart edge platform is some smart device platform, the third part is the power IC power management chip.

The second Smart Edge Platform is a 39% revenue from our entire company in the first quarter.

This new product line, which we have mentioned in the beginning, is a few new opportunities in this Smart Edge Platform I may be a little bit more to talk about here, including more things like Connectivity Connectivity, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Modem, etc. There are some things like this. There are solutions that we have developed here most of the revenue is in the Smart Edge Platform, so this product portfolio is not only in this year, but in fact, this year we have more than ever since there has been Technology Migration, from the earliest Wi-Fi 4 to Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6, and now we are in the world leaders of Wi-Fi 7, there is a very good position here, so this technology migration is also for us, and the average price is increased, in addition to the Wi-Fi Platform. We have been working hard on the Smart Edge Platform, the last 3 Power ICs that we are working on, the power management is about 5% of the revenue here, of course, we have just mentioned that Debite needs power management, so we have some of the medium and long-term goals, and we hope that we can enter into some new areas, including the Data Center section and the Automotive section of the Power IC, which we continue to grow in the global market, so it is likely that we are a relatively high level product that lasts twice a year, and then the Payout Ratio is about 80 to 85%.

So we can do this as we continue to communicate with our customers and understand the needs of the market, and we also control our own inventory. Our inventory management now we all have a close review of this regular review. I think the exchange rate is the same for all of us. Our repairs are US dollars, so all of our products are priced in US dollars to convert to Taiwan dollars.

The most important thing is to look at this exchange rate fluctuation. There are some companies that will have some impact on this dollar collection. If you have any questions, please raise your hand to discuss whether it is in development or even in the mobile phone, there are other related cooperation to ask. Is there a significant mass production for our N1 series of NYX N1 series, which we are currently maintaining in 4Q or 26 years?

If you have any questions, please feel free to raise your hand to discuss. Now there is a June to be listed Eat, I would like to ask about future mergers and acquisitions or investment direction which may go in the direction of what to do. We will continue to have a team that has been watching most of us or is more strategic with our industry, or that we can have liverage of these projects. It may not be possible to compare what we are currently taking a more flexible strategic alliance, it may be part of the equity investment, or exclude it is to do this MMA, but I want to consider a more complete and accurate assessment.

Joining NV-Link is a plus for us. Because I have so much more to offer to my customers. I can provide more confident combinations. More diverse things help our customers reduce TCO. I want to compare with other. Our experience with NVIDIA in IP licensing.

Very rich. The two companies are actually very familiar with this business model. It is very familiar with the two times. The Jensen is also on top of Rick's Kino. They also have a little talk about this part on the table.

The company's RD team has just mentioned this series in the past. From car to GP10 to some IoT, etc. The cooperation on the case is quite smooth. So it will be one after the other.

In the past few years, investors in qualified investors, after losing about 30 million, became 13 million people. We hope that through Taiwan Innovation Edition, not a boutique concept, we hope that it can create more value and attract more Asian such an emerging, start-up company, can be listed in Taiwan, and then form another unique new industrial cluster of our capital market.

I think this is a very important source in the whole sector, which will be separated from other sectors in the future." Lin Shuming hopes that the future will encourage artificial intelligence, robotics, drones and other emerging industry companies to enter the capital market early, focusing on technology and innovation, and encouraging high-quality enterprises.

Here are the rescheduled paragraph transcripts: Hello everyone, welcome to the Taiwan science and technology guided theme hosted by the Stock Exchange, is a performance lookup. Yes, please. Congratulations, the competition begins. Computex group race to pick the 25th event scene, I am the extraordinary TV broadcaster Zhu Sihan, so happy that you all join us today to participate in such an event, and today comes to the afternoon session, there are four companies, namely the giant industry, material KY, Solomon and still still bright in the afternoon, these four companies will carry their company briefings, and the financial situation introduction, and there is a time for feedback, each company will have 30 minutes at the back.

Next, we would like to invite you to join us for a presentation about 20 minutes in the morning, and then we would like to have a Q&A session about 10 minutes in the afternoon. Then, we would like to invite you to join us today and introduce you to our guests, and we would like to invite you to come up with some of our live audience friends to say hello. First of all, we would like to invite you to Mr. Huang Zhongjie, and then we would like to invite you to join us after the presentation. We would like to present the presentation to you, Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin, and thank you.

We are the first manufacturer of clothing that focuses on the whole process of garment manufacturing. We are also the first one in Taiwan to focus on the development of a whole process of garment manufacturing in the south, and now we are a garment manufacturer of corporate headquarters in Southeast Asia. 95% of the production capacity is mainly mainly in these places, so our main customers are basically serving some international brands such as Europe and Asia, such as Japan, etc. Therefore, it is only a matter of time to focus, the ocean's focus is also to provide a so-called multi-flexible speed response, so in addition to manufacturing fast, we provide many of the existing customers to help them deal with some inventory management, or a design research and development of long-term international outlook, some of the whole process services.

We believe that is the future of a garment manufacturing, in fact, in addition to the global layout, that is, of course, the bigger the trend, because it is the fact that the customer is now demanding some of the services are getting wider, which also greatly increases the overall entrance to this industry of a threshold, so it is not as if you just said that you can buy a clothing you can provide some design and R&D capabilities even good, but now you have to do a lot of data analysis or some material development or even some future forward thinking technology, or some information sharing or ESG, etc. Some of the technology can be long-term attract customers to work with the service. So because the threshold is getting higher and higher, so the supplier is actually more than the threshold of his services in the last few years, which is why many Taiwanese peers in the world can be very bright because it is actually a cooperative cooperation in this field.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how to make a reasonable segmentation, while keeping the sequence and content of the sentences intact.

For example, the first part of the discussion is about the status quo of fast fashion, followed by the importance of turning to ESG, then about the business structure and market distribution of the giant sheep company, and finally about the change in financial performance and market demand in the first quarter. Each topic may need to be segmented, but pay attention to the consistency between sentences. Next, I need to check if there is a repeating sentence or content between sentences.

However, users may not specify whether they need to keep timestamps, so they may need to confirm. However, according to the treatment in the example, users may want to remove timestamps and only retain text content. During segmentation, make sure each paragraph is carried around a topic. For example, the importance of ESG can be combined into one segment, another segment of the business structure and market distribution, financial performance and market demand changes as follow-up paragraphs.

At the same time, pay attention to the logical connection between sentences, making the paragraph smoother, but not to change the original or added content. There is also need to deal with some oral expressions, such as "for", "that's a little wait", etc., which need to be retained during the conversion, but may need to adjust the punctuation symbols, such as the use of dashes or ellipses to indicate a pause or turning point. In addition, pay attention to the words of the sentence, such as "so", "and then", etc., to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. Finally, check if there are missing sentences or formatting errors, make sure that all content is converted correctly, and there is no missing any part.

This is why we feel that we have always felt that we have seen very good performance in the industry, and the customer also appreciate this piece. So we think that this long-term good operation, must be very helpful for the future development of Taiwan. That is a little bit. That said, the current operation, you can see that is said that the category of giant sheep clothing, about half of the basic energy services, such as sports categories, or some high-end basal clothing, etc., or you can say that this is a thing of the giant fiber, and half of the so-called fast fashion, there are some more traditional clothing, which is more like cotton.

So, that's half of what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. That's why we're not exactly one focus on this, we're not entirely focused on a particular product, but what we're asking for is that the market needs. From a revenue perspective, we can see that we really value the U.S. market, and even after more than three decades of hard work, the U.S. brand still accounts for more than 70% of our company's characteristics.

So, this part is also because the Japanese brand in the years of development, there is also a global layout, and they also look at the global layout, so they also want to rely on the global layout ability, especially in Europe and the United States market experience some of the suppliers to cooperate with him. So, this is why we say that our Japanese customers here growth, probably every year is very stable, can not tell the depth of the water, so it should be a thriving market. So we think of it for a long time, so first of all, first of all, we can actually see our revenue, as well as the performance of the whole gross profit margin, is a bit better than expected.

This is the first time that we have seen a lot of things happening this year, but we have a lot of problems, but we have a lot of problems, but we have a lot of problems, a lot of many uncertainties. But after all, one thing we see now is that the global inventory is relatively healthy compared to the previous year. So as long as there is a basic need for things, the focus is to say that what you want to sell is now, rather than probably not like it.

But like some outings seem to be more like going to work, because it may not feel like going to work, but in the past two or two years, many home workers in the United States have been accustomed to this way, they actually have returned to their company since this year to go to work, so they also need some work-related clothing. So this year, in fact, a way to promote the whole demand is in addition to the restocking, is some because they have been staying at home for too long, now to go back to work, so always buy something new to wear.

This is not the absolute amount of this is called a sportswear, the sports wear of the same level of things relative to the value of CP, which may buy relatively better, but the discount in the relatively low discount may also be slightly cheaper to sell a little better. On this side is a current capacity one planning, that is, of course, this year's uncertainty is very large, but you can also see that the last few years, most of the time the relative growth and demand of the giant sheep is stable.

The following is a re-routing paragraph verbatim: His relative performance is worth a few things compared to his guests. For that matter, there is a lot of past things or talk about the outlook for this year's future. We feel that the biggest challenge this year is the so-called uncertainty of tariffs and so on. Of course, one of the conclusions we have all communicated with our guests is that we don't know what the entire tariff will look like at the end of the year.

We also believe that the advantage of the goat is that it is one of the major silver producers produced in Southeast Asia. His advantage is that it is fast and produced in a relatively stable area relative to Europe and America. So guests also value this kind of supplier to talk to him in the future. So we also think that the impact of this tariff is a big development.

It's just because we don't know when this can be passed on to end consumers. Everyone is also thinking about a better way to deal with one of the effects of this current tariff. So we are currently at a stage in this rule that the so-called old rules have been broken. For this uncertainty, of course, we must show that it's a better fit and toughness. Because you can't do anything because of course. But once a situation that breaks that habit, it must be a bit more difficult time.

However, this benefit may be a better opportunity to develop in a situation where new rules are built. But this year may take a quarter to two quarters to really understand what countries need and what the future looks like. If we plan to build a future that everyone can agree on, we will provide some of the services they need at various vendors. So we think it is, of course, that this kind of adjustment we have experienced many times in the past.

But the fact is that after the company is ready to adapt to the environment, it can be slowly or even quickly reflected, the last performance is very bright. So we think that is to cultivate a current understanding of the customer's depth of cooperation with him, etc., we are very confident that in the future, although there will be some tariff uncertainty and some policy uncertainty. However, after that, we think that with a current capacity and a grasp of all aspects, should be in some of the suppliers of the customer's expectations, there can be some outstanding performance.

We can go to the next link thank you. Well that's a very good question and a question that everyone wants to know. So the second answer is that once the price rises, it means that a lot of tariffs are an additional cost.

Of course, this is going to lead to a social problem more than we can see. So most brands are not easy to talk about this. Because this effect is not just about the brand image, but the consumption of the whole country, etc., the future of economic development. The overall level will have some impact. In short, if the price is really going up, this pressure on suppliers and brands should be slowed down.

But it is more complex than this. Because one of the negative effects of your bucks is also straightforward. Unless you are an irreplaceable one, it is not you. There may be a uniqueness like some high-end chip, etc. So from the point of view of the eleven living these clothing categories, unless the brand has an advantage that is very superior to other brands.

This is the most pragmatic question. We interact with our guests, and they still think that the impact of the entire tariff lasts, how do we really know? Because we still think that the brand is socially responsible or very important.

So from their comparison or from a point of view. Taking care of the brand image and the consumer's point of view is that since he does not know how to do so, 90 days after tariffs are. You can't pass this pressure to consumers at this point in time.

These consumers go to his store to buy because they believe he will provide one. An environment relative to what he wants. For this reason we believe that we are at least listening to it this year. Brand tendencies or he thinks he really can't afford this. Tariffs lead him to don't make money for what he might have ordered.

It's either temporary or not. Most things are still present. I don't want to raise the price this year. But if you really need to raise the price, the current consensus is, if not, if not. The global economy of the United States economy does not affect one of them.

There is a possibility that there will be a price increase in the next year. At some point in the next year, this is probably a general consensus that the client is currently communicating with. There is no better place to invest in advanced things to ask questions. We have gathered some questions before and we have to ask that first. The main question may still be related to tariffs and exchange rates just mentioned.

There is no way to do a reaction in advance, or if it is, or if it is. There is still uncertainty about this situation. There is nothing we can do, such as production.

There is no way we can make some adjustments ourselves more proactively. First of all, in this section of the clothing category, we do not actually see a condition of any pre-loaded goods. As we just said, it is true that for years.

What is called a rapid response is that if there is a market demand we may be able to. Within two weeks. Ship within two weeks. Because I believe we've heard a fast fashion icon before. ZARA may have said something in two weeks before. But now.

The same conditions can be achieved in various brands. So, it means that if the terminal is very demanding, it is enough to do these preparations two weeks before the end. The other thing is that the clothes are not suitable to prepare in advance and do a lot of preparation.

It's better to wear short sleeves than long sleeves when they're sold in the summer than when they're not sold in the winter. The shoes may not be bought all the time. The difference is not too much. They have sneakers behind them. But the clothes have thick and thin. So that's it.

We believe that whether you ask us or any of our peers, we think it is. The market needs the climate. What needs to be provided. In fact, many brands don't do much of this.

One scheduling in advance is much more expensive than you think. When you are involved in the so-called ocean freight and air freight. We think you see it. It's good to sell clothes. It's either great on climate change. Or, it's really good on demand.

It is said that some adjustments are made in the production base, or the customer adjusts to it. To minimize this part of the tariff is feasible. Is this part of our advice or we say that an interaction with the customer and trust is a business of trust for many years.

And they said to him, 'We have sinned, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery, and we have committed adultery.'

Profits are actually much higher than that of many industries. A lot of them come from this so-called mutual trust. That's why even now people are worried about U.S. tariffs and so on.

But we have to look at it with peace. Even if there is such a uncertainty in the United States or a very good market, there is no place to really replace him.

So we think it's a negotiable communication. A partner or a friend. A partner is a friend. Of course, everyone can protect one for their own interests. It's not a problem with country. But you need to find a good partner to replace it with a friend.

So, of course, to think that. You see the United States making a lot of changes, but he needs more to support one of his partner ally. We want to talk about taking advantage of one big shuffling around the world this time.

There are questions to be asked about investing in advanced doors, because time relations should be the last question. There are related questions, whether they are media friends or legal people. Is there a relevant question to ask? Well, that's what we're talking about today.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and convert it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that I fully understand the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and kept the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice the sentences that follow after each timestamp. My task is to reorganize these timestamps and sentences into a coherent paragraph while retaining all the original information. It is important to note that some sentences may have overlap or interval in the timestamp, which may affect the coherence of the paragraph, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep them all. Next, I need to determine how to segment.

However, if these duplicate titles are programme names, they may need to be merged, but the user does not have a description, so keep them as they are. Then, processing the product introduction, such as the application of silk, plastic grade sheet, etc., may need to be segmented, but the order of the original sentence must be maintained. Similarly, it is necessary to include all the parts of factory distribution, staff size, ESG certification, customer structure, carbon emissions data, etc., but it is necessary to ensure that all the sentences are included.

When handling carbon emissions data, it is important to pay attention to the accuracy of numbers and units, such as "5.18" and "4.817", etc., to ensure that these data have not been modified during the conversion process. At the same time, attention should be paid to the consistency of sentences, such as "Carbon emissions is 4.817" after the supplement, but the original text may not be provided, so keep it as it is. In addition, the "Salt frying company" mentioned by the user may be mistaken for "smokers", but according to the context, may refer to tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, BAT, Japan Tobacco International, JTI and Imperial Tobacco.

At the same time, make sure that there are no explanations or summaries added, just reorganize the original content into paragraph form. In conclusion, I need to process the sentence, by logic, keep all the original content, without any modification or deletion, to ensure that the final output meets the user's requirements. </think>

The silk is mainly applied to the fabric of clothing. It is like everyone includes the host just that. Wear the suit jacket inside it. In the pocket comparison. The gloss is very good and then the softness is very good. The raw material is used the so-called acetate fiber filament.

To produce. Another big category of products is this plastic-grade sheet of our company. The application of that sheet is wider, including frames.

A pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses, or a pair of glasses.

Yes. This plastic grade sheet made by our company. The whole group has a total of six. You can see that Jinan Nature is our first factory. It contains Jinan Nature's second factory.

All in Jinan City, Shandong. It is a factory that produces silk. The number of employees is about. About 240 people. The one astek below it is mainly made of silk. The number of employees is nearly 200.

The one on the left is the one on the right, and the one on the right is the one on the left, and the one on the right is the one on the left, and the one on the right is the one on the left.

Crude acid and dried. That is the bottom of our March. It was just built and started. This milk raw core material was put into production. It is a new factory of materials. It contains the coarse piece of textile machine that can produce plastic machines.

There is also a thick sourdough. So far. The number of employees is about 125. We have some advantage over the entire group and I'll be talking to you soon. The first one.

We are in the middle of a downstream, downstream, downstream, downstream, downstream, and we want to make sure that our raw materials are stable.

That's right. It gives us an advantage in terms of cost. So you can see this in our company. Profits or gross profit margins. I think it's better than the industry. That's what we get at our factory.

This is part of local or municipal certifications. Our factory belongs to a green factory. The product features. We are crude acid fiber, so it is a raw material of a biomachine. It can be biodegradable, so it is compared to the raw material of a conventional petrochemical machine.

We have a lower carbon footprint. With this. Sustainability. On top of sustainability. In 2024, we got the part of this business week focused on ESG. We got the one of the top 100 low-carbon companies in China.

We are the company. We will continue. We will continue to strengthen this environmental sustainability. We are above the performance of our operations. Recently, we have an event in CommonWealth Magazine. It is a survey of 2000 companies.

We have been together for 23 years and 20 years. We have won this for 2 consecutive years. The best operating performance is number one. On top of the customer's structure.

The four major international salt frying companies contain what includes Philip Morrison. The British American salt frying company BAT. It is also Japan JTI.

And last but not least. German imperial salt frying company Impero. We have probably been working with them since 2022, so we have been working with them for a long time. It also ensures the quality of our products.

Our peers are even better than our peers. That was the last thing we continued to develop. Some biodegradable products. Included just said this.

The materials for the AI glasses are now included. We also actively want to do the raw materials to go up and down again. Do HEC and MC, etc. of this raw materials. This is just a matter. Just say it. We are the best operating performance.

In 2000. This is the first and the first of its kind. This is our company for the certification of this ESG carbon footprint. Every year. From this securities authority. All listed cabinets are required.

Before the company started. We searched for two years to get started. Greenhouse gas inventory. And we. We. The independent third party.

This is the message of our Lord Jesus Christ to us, and it is the message of the gospel that we have received from Him, that we may be saved from the wrath of God.

This is the word of God, the word of God, the word of God, the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God, and the word of God.

This third-party certification is completed. This is calculated. The number of producers. Each ton of carbon emissions is 4.817. This is also shown here.

This is above the factory. Energy consumption, or power consumption, etc. This carbon emission is less than one-in-one of the main sales customers. This value.

Of course, we will continue to do our best. Strengthen this. This is carbon reduction. Or the net leader's goal. In ESG, we talk about this part of the sustainable environment.

Our environmental spending is estimated to be about 87.6%. The treatment of this waste water is followed by the environmental spending. We are constantly adding new changes to this environmental protection equipment every year. This is an increase of 40.91% compared to 2023.

So, we have always shown that our group has a focus on this environmental management. What is above water and wastewater treatment?

The total water density of our 24 years decreased by 12 percent from 2023, and the total water volume of the entire collection reached 59 million tonnes, which accounted for nearly 50% of the total water usage throughout the year. What is the focus? In 2024, of course, we did not have any super-targets in our plant in 2023. The management of raw materials and recycling above, we, this stroke chemistry, he produced more than 30 percent of the fine acids during the production of this piece, and then through some special process, he can restore to this 99.95% acid, which can continue to be used, which is what has been said before, whether it is biodegradable products or our production process has been recycled. The energy consumption intensity in 2024 is also reduced by around 20% in 2023.

The third part of the operation outlook is here to introduce you to the previous mention of heating non-burning smoke, that does not burn his smoke smoke smoke cigarettes in this filter is the raw material of acetate fiber wetty, then our company's products are also provided to our customers to do this so-called smoke filter raw material. In the heating non-burning smoke section, we can see that some data this year, he is more than 25% to 30%, and that especially in Japan, this heating non-burning tobacco products in this market has more than 30% in the market, that is now Asia is Japan and South Korea and even Indonesia, which is the highest acceptance for this heating non-burning smoke.

In addition, there are many developed countries, including the United States, including Brazil, etc., and even mainland China, which may be open to this kind of products, which Taiwan believes will be reviewed by the competent authority for some time. These are some of the current in Taipei, including in the streets of the Taipei City, including Xinxing District, this so-called Philip Morrison iQOOS, the Gallebra smoking store, because he has not been approved so far, so he is currently operating in the way of repairing the station. The operating outlook is to talk about another topic is just mentioned in front of the AI glasses, the market of the AI glasses, 2024 has passed the 152 million rich, which is estimated to be more than 90 million times in 2030, so the load growth rate is more than 70%.

[18090. 40-18091. 94] Acetate cellulose. [18096. 80-18100. 90] The last mention of another product of our company is acetate cellulose. [18101. 42-18106. 54] This cellulose cellulose is also done with diacetate cellulose. [18106. 80-18109. 36] The name of the forest we call him. [18109. 60-18110. 64] What is the name of the forest?

[18110. 94-18111. 44] Forest. [18111. 70-18112. 48] In short, one of the raw materials of acetate cellulose is wood pulp. [18112. 98-18113. 76] Acetate cellulose, one of its raw materials is wood pulp. [18114. 00-18117. 34] Acetate cellulose, one of its raw materials is wood pulp, and one of its raw materials is wood pulp. [18117. 60-18119. 90] That wood pulp is Eucalyptus. [18120. 16-18121. 68] Every five years, it is cut down to make wood pulp.

[18122. 72-18125. 02] Which cut it down to make wood pulp. [18126. 04-18127. 32] This wood pulp is why we say that he is a bio-based raw material and how he has a scouting machine is a copy concept. [18127. 58-18128. 60] This wood pulp is why we say that he is a bio-based raw material and how he has a copying machine is a concept. [18128. 86-18130. 64] Why we say that he is a bio-based raw material and how he has a copying machine is a concept. [18130. 90-18133. 20] Bio-based raw material and how he has a copying machine. [18133. 46-18136. 02] How the scouting machine is a copying machine is a concept.

[18136. 28-18137. 04] Because he may do this when the trees grow, we call it carbon dioxide. [18137. 56-18140. 64] The tree may do this when he grows, we call it carbon dioxide. [18140. 94-18142. 98] Do this when we call it carbon dioxide. [18143. 24-18144. 26] We call it carbon dioxide that absorbs the atmosphere. [18144. 52-18146. 32] It is a carbon dioxide that absorbs the atmosphere. [18146. 56-18147. 84] The probe is copied.

[18148. 36-18149. 38] Copy it. [18155. 78-18159. 88] Well, this is a market prospect for the acetate cell death of the forest. [18160. 14-18161. 42] The prospect of the market is very good. [18161. 92-18165. 52] The current demand in China is about a year of 25000 tons. [18165. 76-18168. 08] About a year is 25000 tons. [18168. 32-18170. 64] It is mainly based on our industry-owned Isman supply.

[18170. 94-18171. 44] Isman supplies. [18171. 70-18172. 48] About 10,000 tonnes of imports every year. [18172. 72-18174. 78] This last part of this period of the Sino-US trade war. [18178. 88-18182. 20] This period of the previous period of the Sino-US trade war. [1818182.2 46-18183. 74] We are certain to think that in the case of tariff increases in Isman imports to mainland China. [18184. 00-18185. 78]

[18186. 04-18187. 84] Imports to mainland China are subject to an increase in tariffs. [18188. 08-18190. 14] In the case of an increase in tariffs. [18191. 16-18195. 52] There must be some kind of conversion effect for our group. [18199. 60-18200. 64] Well, our group will probably set a few goals every year. [18200. 94-18202. 48] We will set a few goals every year. [18202. 72-18205. 04] Of course, we still want the market to expand and then seize the market share can be more than 10%.

[18205. 54-18210. 16] We want to see this market at a slow speed that we will be actively or rapidly expanding this plant. [18210. 66-18214. 76] We will also continue to develop biodegradable products. [18214. 78-18218. 86] It also takes advantage of the opportunity for the entire circular economy to develop. [18218. 88-18222. 96] Finally, we want to maintain a return on the equity of more than 20%. [18222. 98-18226. 28] This is the strengthening and implementation of some commitments and practices to implement this environmental sustainability. [18226. 30-18230. 64] The above is a brief presentation with advanced investment here.

[18230. 94-18231. 44] We hope that we will always excel in maintaining a return on shareholders' equity above 20%. [18231. 70-18232. 22] We hope that we will always excel in maintaining a return on shareholders' equity above 20%. [18232. 48-18236. 82] We will always excel in maintaining a return on shareholders' equity above 20%. [18237. 08-18238. 36] Finally, we will strengthen and implement some commitments and practices to implement this environmental sustainability. [18238. 62-18239. 64] Strengthen and implement some commitments and practices to implement this environmental sustainability. [18239. 90-18242. 20]

[18242. 46-18244. 50] The above is a brief presentation with advanced investment here. [18244. 76-18246. 04] The investment in advanced here is a brief presentation. [18246. 56-18249. 36] Well, we are very grateful for the wonderful sharing of the Chief Financial Officer. [18249. 38-18253. 72] Next, we will also ask the Chairman to come to us first, because it is part of Q&A. [18253. 98-18260. 38] Later in this Q&A session we want to ask questions whether they are legal persons or media friends or we raise our hands. [18260. 94-18263. 76]

[18264. 26-18268. 10] If you want to ask questions, whether legal or media friends, we will raise your hand. [18268. 36-18271. 44] Then the staff will give you the microphone. [18271. 68-18275. 02] Then our scene can hear your voice clearly. [18275. 78-18281. 92] Now the Q&A section to ask if there are any investment advanced or media friends who want to ask questions first. [18282. 18-18283. 72] We can raise your hand to ask questions. [18284. 24-18284. 74]

[18287. 04-18287. 56] Hello. [18288. 08-18290. 64] I would like to ask you who I have seen in the first quarter only to know. [18290. 94-18295. 28] The parts of our inventory are actually about twice the amount of the remanufactured product in the fourth quarter last year. [18295. 80-18297. 08] I would like to double the amount of the fourth quarter last year. [18297. 34-18298. 36] I would like to ask why. [18300. 92-18309. 12] I think the first quarter has always been this traditional spring.

[18309. 36-18311. 16] This China's customs are no longer working. [18311. 42-18314. 74] Then this will only begin seriously until the Lantern Festival. [18315. 52-1831. 30] So I think this is a very normal phenomenon. [18318. 56-18318. 58] This is a very normal phenomenon. [18318. 84-18320. 64] This is the first quarter of the year. [18320. 94-18321. 44]

[18321. 70-18325. 28] There are almost a month's time for customs to stop working. [18325. 54-18327. 84] This will allow the goods to go out in the second quarter. [18328. 10-18328. 88] The goods will go out in the second quarter. [18337. 32-18341. 92] Okay, there are no media friends on our site or investment advanced questions to ask. [18346. 54-18347. 82] The Chairman is very nice. [18351. 44-18359. 64] Please forgive me about the main reasons why the gross interest rate is likely to drop by about 3-4% in the first quarter.

[18360. 16-18365. 02] There is no such thing as a thank you to the mayor who has benefited from the large effect of the tariff transfer. [18365. 28-18365. 78] OK. [18366. 04-18368. 34] So you can see that our first quarter revenue is about 10% higher than the first quarter of the same quarter of the same year. [18371. 42-18374. 48] That means that we have some differences in our entire product portfolio. [18374. 74-18376. 54] This is because the first quarter of our first film sales is much higher than last quarter of the year. [18376. 80-18379. 36] It is generally said that the first film has no gross profit margin.

[18380. 94-18384. 26] So in such a case for a long period of time this view may be due to the fact that we are going to make this investment in Luzsen this year. [18384. 52-18386. 56] So that will give this gross profit rate a balance of this difference. [18388. 36-18389. 12] So in such a case for a long time this view may be due to the fact that we are going to make this investment in Luzsen this year. [18390. 16-18393. 48] So that will make this gross profit rate a balance of this difference. [18393. 74-18397. 06] Maybe we are due to this investment in Luzsen this year.

[18397. 32-18397. 84] This output. [18400. 40-18402. 18] This gross profit margin has a balance of this difference. [18402. 44-18405. 76] This balance of this difference. [18406. 02-18408. 58] This may be due to the reasons for this portfolio. [18409. 36-18410. 64] So I think this is the most important. [18410. 94-1842. 72] The most important.

[18415. 28-18415. 80] OK. [18416. 06-18418. 36] I think this is very obvious. [18419. 38-18420. 16] I emphasize this. [18420. 66-18422. 96] This is not only the textile industry in Taiwan that I want to see the world. [18428. 60-18430. 40] This is the phenomenon. [18430. 6418432. 44] This is all liquid.

[18432. 70-18435. 00] So regardless of Polyester Nylon or Acrylic. [18435. 26-18438. 58] Then this kind of petrochemical machine textile industry. [18439. 10-18439. 86] basically speaking. [18440. 12-18443. 96] is subject to a bottleneck. [18444. 22-18447. 54] Now many of this European and American customers ask you to do this with Polyester or Nylon. [18447. 80-18449. 84]

[18450. 10-18451. 90] You have to prove that everything is recycled from the bottle. [1845. 14-1845. 66] Used. [18453. 18-18454. 20] So he will give him a limit. [18454. 46-18456. 50] So the reason is to say that the whole trend is a green product. [18464. 44-18464. 94] This trend is a product that is trending toward a green. [18465. 46-18466. 22] Trending a green product.

[18466. 48-18468. 78] Trending to a green product. [18469. 30-18469. 82] This cellulose is something that can be degraded in a day. [18470. 12-18471. 90] and can be regenerated. [18472. 16-18475. 50] A special mention of our chief financial officer was that the five-year regeneration of Eugarius. [18475. 74-18477. 28] He has a FIC certification. [18477. 54-18479. 84] He wants to plant 10 trees every time he chops a tree.

[18480. 10-18482. 66] So what area of the mountain he has a number. [18482. 88-18486. 48] So when you use the raw material, you know that it is a substitute for each other. [18490. 74-18490. 04] These are used in conjunction with light in this board when he absorbs carbon dioxide. [18490. 30-18492. 58] So he is congenial and can be regenerated.

It is a green color, so it is basically the beginning of the cellulose, and it is actually the beginning of the second world war. This is the beginning of Bayer.

At the same time, this wife of Stalin was his wife after this time in Russia, and he did not know whether he was killed or killed.

It has a long history, for the whole human race is not the same as nature, it is very important, materials.

This is the reason why we often use capsule coffee, which is why we often use capsule coffee, which may be on the head of the house, so we don't have that kind of work to do.

A capsule coffee. You see. After drinking a cup of coffee, you lose that plastic case. In fact, it will also burden the earth. There are many capsule coffees now. It is also a film with cellulose.

"This is the life of this world," he said, "and this is the life of this world, and this is the life to come, and this is the life to come.

When you are in the middle of a meal, you are in the middle of a meal, and when you are in the middle of a meal, you are in the middle of a meal, and when you are in the middle of a meal, you are in the middle of a meal.

The fruit of the tree of life is like the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is like the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

So we called the company Nature. So basically, I believe. Cellulose is the application of this textile industry. Not only the current quantity, but also the question of the turntable you mentioned.

This is because the Islamic State is mainland China. We are familiar with the largest amount of jade. I think it is because of the relationship between customs and customs, which caused us to replace it.

"We are not going to be able to do this every day," he said, "but we are going to do it every day, and we are going to do it every day.

We are like, why would it be replaced by so many of these textiles now? He has this pattern. He has this. Cash in design waits for him to receive a single one. He then calls Isman again from the United States.

We will be there for you for two months, and then we will be there for you, and you will be there for two months.

And the day of the Lord shall come, and the day of the Lord shall come, and the day of the Lord shall be, and the day of the Lord shall be, and the day of the Lord shall be, and the day of the Lord shall be, and the day of the Lord shall be.

There are eight thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them, and one thousand of them.

There is a great deal of good and evil in the world, and there is a lot of good and evil in the world, and there is a lot of good and evil in the world.

This kind of thing is often the case, but the cost of this kind of thing can be reduced a lot, so I think this kind of cellulite is long.

Yes, for the future. Development of the industry. It will create a lot of this output space. Good time relationship has the last question behind this Mr... The chairman wants to ask because the need for this part of the filament is mentioned here in China.

A year 25000 tonnes. But then. The supply of 148 tonnes there is a year 1 million tonnes. The gap in the middle of that is the past.

Or, if you are afraid of a third party, you may be afraid of a third party, but you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, and you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party, or you are afraid of a third party.

Manufacturer We can supply a year from 4000 to 5000 tons. There is also a Lithuania in the three Nordic countries. Lithuania is an old production line in the old Soviet region. So, when Lithuania was passing through the sealand and the central European railway. Yes.

But this is because it is a very old production line originally designed by Italians, so the quality is actually very poor.

It's not really this competition, because after all, he has a large amount of Isman, Isman, so I think, in quality.

We are thankful to the President for sharing with the Chief Financial Officer today.

It will start at 3:20pm, and we'll be looking forward to seeing you again.

[19217. 66-19247. 66] [19247. 66-19277. 66] [19277. 66-19337. 66] [19337. 66-19367. 66] [19367. 66-19397. 66] [19397. 66-1947. 64] Mirror and Dot column. [19457. 66-19457. 64] Mirror and Dot column. [19457. 66-19487. 64] Mirror and Dot column. [19457. 66-1947. 64] Mirror and Dot column. [19157. 66-19547. 64] Mirror and Dot column. [19157. 66-19547. 64] Mirror and Dot column.

[19547. 66-19555. 50] Mirror and Dot column. [19555. 50-19559. 82] Mirror and Dot column. [19559. 82-19563. 56] Mirror and Dot column. [19563. 60-19574. 62] Mirror and Dot column. [19574. 62-19576. 76] Mirror and Dot column. [19576. 76-19577. 48] Mirror and Dot column.

[19577. 48-19577. 54] Also everything. [19577. 54-19577. 56] has audioredana Hong base and then me. [19577. 56-19577. 60] is what I think. [19577. 60-19577. 64] Your stenticiedangna l MPSD. [19577. 64-19579. 08] A small difference. [19577. 44-19582. 76] Let's look at the entire operating expenses section.

[19583. 02-19584. 04] 2.1.6 billion. [19584. 30-19586. 08] This part is probably more than last year. [19586. 34-19589. 42] The same period is probably an increase of 1.8 million in that part mainly in our. [19589. 68-19590. 96] R&D costs. [19591. 20-19594. 02] An increase in our sales costs. [19594. 80-19597. 36] The part of the industry we profit.

[19597. 60-19601. 44] 1800 million compared to 23 million lost last year. [19601. 70-19606. 06] Approximately an increase of 41 million of profit from the business. [19606. 06-19608. 62] We will then look at it. [19609. 14-19609. 64] Outside. [19610. 42-1912. 20] Outside revenue portion. [19612. 46-19614. 00] is 261 million.

[19614. 50-19617. 84] The word here is about 67 million less than the same period last year. [19618. 34-19621. 68] The word here is mainly what we look at there. [19621. 94-19622. 96] Other. [19626. 80-19628. 08] This is mainly here. [19629. 62-19631. 14] Other.

[19633. 70-19634. 22] Yes. [19634. 48-19636. 02] Loss of 31 million. [19636. 32-19638. 10] It is mainly held by our company. [19638. 36-19642. 46] Some of the stocks invested in were at the time of March. [196432. 72-19646. 04] The entire market is not good enough for us to lose a general estimate. [19646. 30-19647. 06] There is a loss.

[19647. 32-19649. 12] One of 71 million. [19649. 38-19650. 14] Impact. [19650. 66-19651. 42] So this book. [19651. 68-19655. 52] One gold coin after tax is 13.10 million. [19656. 02-19658. 08] That EPS is at 0.07 yuan. [19658. 34-19659. 36] It is here.

[19669. 62-19661. 40] A portion of the entire merger. [19661. 92-19663. 20] Next we look at the following. [19661. 74-19666. 02] In the part of the asset representation. [19666. 32-19668. 10] We look at the total assets at [19668. 62-19669. 38] 10 billion. [19669. 64196706. 66] 71 million.

[19670. 92-19674. 26] increased by about 1.3 billion compared to last year. [19674. 50-19678. 10] was mainly an increase of about 2.4 billion followed in the receivables section. [19678. 34-19680. 90] The reduction of 100 million in stock here also echoed us. [19681. 16-1968.2. 70] See the whole of the first quarter of one. [19682. 96-19684. 24] The performance was a growth. [19685. 26-19687. 56] The total debt was 39 billion.

[19687. 82-19689. 62] It was an increase of about 3 billion than last year. [19690. 12-19692. 18] It was an increase of 6 in the paid-up portion. [19692. 42-19692. 94] 6 million. [19693. 46-19695. 76] The other part was the paid-up portion. [19696. 06-19696. 82] Because we are going to this year. [19698. 10-19698. 62]

[19698. 88-19701. 94] The distribution of dividends is about 1 piece of money, so there is about a dividend here. [19702. 20-19704. 50] 1.700 million of a debt payable. [19705. 28-19707. 32] The total debt ratio is about 40%. [19708. 10-19711. 16] The shareholders' equity is about 600 million. [19711. 42-19715. 00] The portion of the shareholders' interest is about 700 million.

[19717. 56-19720. 12] The net worth per share is $35.4 per share. [19722. 18-1972. 94] We look at the next page. [19723. 70-19725. 76] This is our history. [19726. 06-19728. 10] EPS is a distribution of dividends. [19728. 36-1972. 14] We look at. [19729. 38-19732. 98] Last year overall, our EPS was 0. 84 for 2024.

[19733. 22-19735. 02] The expected dividend is 1 dollar. [19736. 56-19738. 10] Next, we will target. [19738. 86-19739. 88] Part of the business face we ask. [19748. 58-19750. 90] I would like to target you all investment friends. [19751. 40-19754. 48] Looking forward to. [19754. 98-19755. 50]

[19756. 06-19758. 10] More concerned about us. [19758. 62-19760. 66] AI also has a robot-related business. [19760. 92-19762. 72] So today I'm also more focused on this section. [19762. 98-19763. 74] That's what I'm talking about first. [197664. 76-19766. 56] That's what I'm talking about first. [19767. 06-19768. 86] It's all about us.

[19769. 38-19770. 14] This. [19770. 40-19775. 00] part of the AI robot does not include this part of our agent now we have over the world. [19775. 78-19776. 80] 500 customers. [19777. 82-19781. 40] Almost one-third of the 500 customers already have. [19781. 92-19784. 22] Repurchase is repeat customer. [19785. 24-19785. 76]

[19786 06-19787. 60] This cross-industry as well. [19788. 10-19788. 88] But many. [19789. 14-19789. 64] I am here. [19789. 90-19791. 18] Two-page explanations. [19791. 44-19793. 22] This first page is for our 3D. [19793. 74-19796. 56] This part of the robot vision.

[19797. 06-1978. 34] This part can be seen. [19798. 86-19801. 42] A semiconductor from the semiconductor equipment. [19802. 18-19805. 26] This FAB a wafer factory, Aye Logistics, a variety of industries. [19805. 52-19806. 80] This industry is very much. [19807 56-19808. 58] It is used. [19809. 10-19811. 66] There are many different applications.

[1981. 92-19814. 74] The RUN of 3D dismantled the pick-up. [19815. 24-19815. 76] To. [19816. 06-19818. 10] Some like the grinding of shoes. [19818. 62-19819. 14] This. [19819. 64-19822. 98] Car coating sprays and many other applications. [19823. 22-19825. 54] Will be applied to 3D vision applications.

[19825. 78-19826. 82] Yes. [19827. 32-19830. 40] And this customer is also distributed worldwide. [19830. 66-19831. 16] For example. [19831. 68-19837. 30] Here we have the United States and the semiconductor equipment of this European system as ours. [19837. 56-193838. 58] Is a big customer. [19838. 84-198393. 36] Next.

[19848. 62-19841. 40] Yes. [19846. 66-198445. 50] Another one is more unrelated to the robot, such as the appearance test. [19846. 06-19848. 36] This test is actually ours. [19848. 62-198451. 94] This is a larger source of business. [19852. 46-19845. 78] This includes faulty detection and counting technology. [19856. 04-198460. 40] OC scan code and many other different applications like us put.

[19866. 28-19867. 06] and so on. [19867. 56-19871. 92] There are more industries used here because all walks of life need to be tested from there. [19872. 42-19874. 98] For example, this is the case.

[19876. 06-19877. 86] Like some fine industries such as Chanel. [19878. 10-19879. 14] to semiconductor. [19879. 38-19880. 42] to agricultural products. [19880. 66-19881. 70] All walks of life are available. [19881. 94-198832. 46] So this part of [19882. 72-198864. 26] is also true.

[19884. 50-19888. 10] Now we are more concerned about the fact that we are here in ROBA. [19889. 38-19890. 66] This team begins to meet. [19890. 90-19892. 96] This Full solution is provided. [19893. 46-19896. 28] That's what we've been up to lately. [19896. 54-198983. 34] Answer and NVIDIA and follow the industry. [19898. 58-19901. 40] Together, we've released a solution.

[19901. 92-19904. 48] These three companies have released this press release. [19904. 98-19906. 02] We put a paragraph. [19906. 32-19907. 08] Video. [19907. 34-19908. 88] This is one of the solutions. [19909. 38-19913. 48] This is what is used in the SERVER AI SERVER defect check above it. [19913. 74-19914. 76] ROBA followed.

[19915. 02-19918. 34] Flaw detection works with this one that is useful in the application of Heida. [19918. 60-19921. 42] Motion Planning path control plus our own. [19921. 68-19922. 96] Detection of AI flaw. [19923. 22-19923. 72] Integration. [19924. 50-19926. 80] What difference this would have in the past could be a set.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will analyze the verbatim provided by the verbatim. Each sentence has a timestamp, and I need to sort these sentences in logical order to form a consistent paragraph.

For example, the first sentence refers to the price of the defect detection software, and then the concept of increasing the average price through the solution and then turning to the physical agent. These content may belong to different paragraphs and need to be grouped according to the theme. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sequence of sentences is correct. During the process, I will check if there is a duplicate or need to adjust the order. For example, in the physical agent section, users mention different aspects, such as visual, hand movements, platform integration, etc., which need to be reasonably segmented to make the content more readable.

In addition, the user mentions the use of Parables, such as Parables for Symphony Orchestra, this section needs to maintain the order of the original sentences to ensure the consistency of the Parables. At the same time, pay attention to the correct use of technical terms, such as "physical agent" and "VOA Vision Language Action Model", to ensure the accuracy of the professional terms. Finally, I will read the passage-based transcription of the entire transition to ensure that no sentences are missing and that the logic is smooth to meet the user's requirements.

So we want to say that by providing more solutions like this, we can increase our average selling price. This is not only the solution we will have a lot of such solutions. Back to the first page, the second, this is the mid-to-long but now is done, that is, Jensen this time in fact, not only this time from CES to GTC to this Computex, there is always the idea of promoting this physiotherapist.

In fact, a physical agent is a physical agent that is different from the agent that we have been talking about for a long time. The agent within the AI definition is that you need to use AI to help the person with the command to do the job. From this point of view of the robot, the agent must have at least a few elements. The first one needs a very clever vision because a good visual look can quickly learn a variety of new objects.

OK. Here in the upper right corner, you'll want to say that this robot not only needs his hands fast, but also the top right corner, is to talk about how his legs can be precise and efficient. That's what we've done with NVIDIA, and we use a lot of his ISAC QMotion, so that the arm can quickly find the optimal path.

So we have to be able to connect with a lot of different robots, such as the traditional robotic robotic robotic dog AMR drone. So in the last eight years, we have this AI in the past eight years, the various robotic robotic robotic robotic robotic robotic dog, and the various kinds of AI neural network motion, these strings together on one platform. That would be what it would look like if each engineer said this to be a string of good time, so we built a platform bottom page.

That said, when you're an engineer to customize some automation applications, you don't need to program anything else, you just need to know what we're doing to pull the box to complete a custom application. That makes it easier for agents to do this, but he hasn't done exactly the level that Janson is talking about. OK. Then we want to say that the future is the LOM Large Language Commands, which we all know now is the LOM Large Language Model, but there is actually a fundamental step that VOM Vision Language Model is even now for robots.

In the future, we can imagine that if only one of the blocks is able to be put into Prompt, this will automatically assign your tasks to different blocks and let the blocks be combined automatically. The future automation will be very easy, which means that you don't need to program yourself anymore. Just give him the natural language, he can do that together, that's the direction we're working on. So you can use a metaphor to say that this agent is like a violin player in this symphony, that's the big agent below it is the small agent who assigns the work to the small agent.



What are some of the other investment questions you would like to ask? Today we have some time to say, welcome to ask. Today is a rare opportunity for the chairman to come to the scene to ask some questions about the future development of AI robots. Want to ask the management team, which of our current operating costs will remain at the Q1 level for the next quarter this year? And then say, where do we spend our operating costs this year?

It is possible that there will be a slight increase in the number of people who are still in the process of expanding because we are still human and RD. Marketing should also be a little more marketing should not be a big increase, and human resources may also add some more. Is there anything else on our site that you would like to ask?

OK, RD's investment of course, software is basically yours, so there will be more software engineers in my just talking about this agent, and of course, we want to speed up the creation of this agent, we can go at least in physical agent, other than the world's leading manufacturers won't fall behind them, so we will have a positive investment on it. Well, if there are no other problems on the site, today's so-called sales outlook will come here to give a paragraph, let's take a warm applause to the chairman and the chief financial officer's share today.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript:. The revenue portion is probably flat, about 309 billion. The stock portion is 380 million. The stock portion is slightly increased, mainly because of the growth of our revenue, this part of the stock here is a little more. However, if we look at the number of days in stock, our stock weekly shows have been maintained for about three months, and compared to the industry, it is also an average.

As you can see, we have also been increasing our real estate and equipment here. Mainly because we began to have some automated equipment related to the parts organs, so at the end of March 31, our real estate facilities reached 563 million. The total assets until the end of March, our total assets were 30.63 billion, and the liability part was 5.41, accounting for 18%. The shareholders' equity part was 25.23 billion, accounting for 80%.

The final part of the cash is 14.05 billion. That is, if free cash flow is seen, because free cash flow is a negative 74 million, which means that we actually have a higher demand for capital in this development process. So when we are in finance doing strategy, we will also move forward to do some financing related to some of our financing and some planning to run the future needs of the company.

The portion of the package of CiFa and the CPO is 5%. The other portion is 16%. If we look at the absolute amount, the portion of our pagecode is a slight decline of 7%. The portion of the OpticalCAM is 29% growth. The portion of the CiFa is a decline of 47%.

But in terms of year-on-year, this year, our performance is pretty good, whether it is part of PageCode Optical and CiFa and CPO and the Ather part. Overall, we grew by 53%. In terms of difference, our main customers are still in the United States. So our US share is about 81%. The Asian portion is 12%. That China portion is 3%.

That part of the EURO is 10%. If we look at the distribution of the amount, the US part is 19% lower. The Asian and China part is showing a recession because the number of days it has worked on the second page in the year is relatively short. The EURO part is 100% higher.

The first is the part of technology. The third is also the part of automation that we have been improving. The part of the AWARD comes from ESG to Semiconductor review, which we have promulgated for us this year with this innovative development plan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and this year with this innovative development plan that we have received this year, and we have also received a corporate award from Telecom Business Review for one of the best photovoltaic originals in the Asia region.

Now, we have been working on a development for the next phase. That is, in the parts of the equipment, from Cable Assembling to NPO Assembling to last year's LPO production line. At present, the company's development is building a mass production line and this supplier of the equipment is also working with the equipment to mass-produce this equipment in a few specifications.

In the current part of the product, the part of our use of jumpers and light junctions in the data center is mainly due to the current large data center is a major professional structure. The demand for light junctions under such a structure will become more and more. Also, for some special light junctions, especially high numbers, so the adoption will be increased because of the need for junction density.

So this part will support some good performance in this business this year. Then the most important thing is the road map of CiFAR. This is the road map of CiFAR that is revealed by the square chrysanthemum. The road map will slowly go from 1. 6T plugable to the PPO with switch. The bandwidth portion will also go from 1. 6T 3. 2T to 6. 4T to 100.

12.8T direction to advance. The application will also move from the CPU with XPU to the CPU with switch to the CPU with XPU in one direction. We have been following this step of the customer to improve our product development. The most important thing for legal entities is the development of this advanced technology, how do we do a layout.

This year's 4Q will produce a mass production of a product. It will also provide back-end system factory to do a system authentication. That in the CPU and assembly, our production line can also do a production line of the CPU contains two lines, one is FAU and the other is assembly. It is expected that in this year's 4Q to next year's 4Q will build our mass production line.

With 4. 6. 4T is the fiber array of 2Dimension's refarcam.

The RMT's main part of the RMT's MMC cable will be placed in the fiber array units. The RMT's connector will be placed in the middle of the system board and the fiber array units will be connected. Therefore, we have already completed the shipment verification for this product and can also use the fiber array units in the refarcam.

The first part is the fiber array units, which is also a very important core. It is also a very important connector in the middle of the silicon optical paper that the current layout is in two directions one is in the standard part, one is in the customization part. The standard platform is mainly to follow the cone factory platform will do the docking and then provide the guest, and the customer can shorten the process of development when doing the development.

The technology of this optical package is to precisely package the FAU in the PIC. This is the COOPER has a division of PIC and PIC, so we have to do a precise docking package. The other part is the 3 part, the 3 part because the fiber array is placed directly in the PIC, so in the middle of the PIC to the system board need to be connected to the board light, so we also made a design in this 3 part, a design that the RMT connector can be connected to the E Fiber array RMT connector, the other part of the MMC connector with our cable will do the docking.

That's what I'm talking about here. First of all, I'd like to thank the Chief Financial Officer for the wonderful sharing, and then the Q&A. It's two levels, I've said that the PIC won't go directly with that, and it's two levels. I've said that the PIC won't go directly with that, and it's going to go directly with the PIC. No, I said that it's going to go directly with the PIC.

So the 2D part is right, because when our Fiber Array Unit is small and very small, so its space is limited, so when your light is in the row when it is very tight, it will have a light flux, a light width limit. We are going to develop it in the direction of 2D. At this point we are developing this part, the Fiber Array Unit of 2D is larger than 6. 4T, so from just this point of view, the future use of more than 6.4T will be placed in the Switch or put in the XPU of this part of the client's design. OK. The LPU, the next one, is this one of the LPU on the right side of the 1.6T is the CPU, is the same thing, is the difference is where it is.

This is the part of the CPU, he will be this light, here longer the light, the whole will be shortened very short, that is very short, he will be directly with our lens with our light with our connection, RMT's connection here, so the development of his development is a little bit different. From the LPU we can see him up, in fact, there is a PCB board and a plugable part, then he to the CPU part, his entire PCB board and plugable part will be completely converted into one, where will not exist, will be completely assembled into the PIC. Because last November the company said, we will not develop the LPU, we are really not the main force, but LPU is a development in the process of the CPU, we now have a lot of resources in the CPU, but with the customer's needs, so that LPU there is also a lot of the LPU is also a customer's, or just the needs.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will analyze the verbatim provided by the verbatim.

I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or conversational rotation in order to make a reasonable segmentation. For example, about capital expenditure, from the beginning of the first quarter of the year, to the end of the year when we actually had a projected growth of working capital, these sentences should be linked together to form a paragraph. In addition, regarding the eraseable and detachable parts, users mentioned a number of technical details, need to ensure that these technical terms and explanations are presented consistently. For example, from the industry has always said the eraseable FAU, I want to clarify whether the phrase "assembly to PIC", these sentences may need to be divided into several paragraphs, but must keep the order of the original sentences.

Therefore, I need to delete the timestamp part and keep only the sentence itself. During the processing process, I also pay attention to the expression and duplicate parts of the spoken language, such as the "to-do", "to-do", "to-do", etc., all of which need to be retained to maintain the authenticity of the dialogue. In addition, the user mentioned "suggestions" may be a typographical error, should confirm whether it is "budget" or other correct vocabulary, but according to the user's request, can not modify the original text, so keep it as it is. Finally, check whether the entire paragraph is smooth, make sure that there is no missing any sentences, and the position of each sentence is correct.

</think> Invest in advanced things to ask questions. Whether it's in the CPO. Maybe some of the developments above the online production schedule or some of the technologies above in the future. Want to ask a few more questions. Well, we're having trouble with the microphone. Thank you.

It was just the first quarter of that year's capital expenditure. The expenditure was 90 million, but I remember. That was last year's follow-up.

Then there is the. he. he. he. ready is the third quarter of the first quarter seems to be a hundred thousand seven. 100 million seven hundred eighty.

Right now, it only cost nine million dollars. Because he currently has some in our working capital because of our current revenue. Also, growth. So we have a lot of demand for working capital here.

That's why when we first saw this feature, we actually included a working capital. This is the expected growth inside. This year, the 5, 200 million is sure to light it up this year. This year, it's going to be.

There is no other way to do this, but there is no other way to do it, and there is no other way to do it, and there is no other way to do it, and there is no other way to do it.

The industry has been talking about rubble FAU I would like to clarify whether the so-called rubble is not. The third part. It should be said that the rubble now is the part. There is this form of existence. Compare the first way. He is.

A scrub-like. The way it exists. That should be what you're asking for. The scrub-like comparison is similar to the one we've used before. This app is just saying that we have a lot of light on the PCB board when we're on the previous transceiver. Now the plug-able is going to be.

The components of the optic component are integrated into the OIC. Then the optic component will be connected to the COOPER here. We in this plugable part will not see all the optic components like the previous PCB on the PCB board. The other part you talk about should be detachable detachable.

When you put it in the PIC, you didn't put it in the exact assembling method, so he could do one. Pull it up one. If he has adamage, you can pull it up and put it up one more time. That way, assembling means that we have packaged the FAU directly in this process. PIC. The design of the upper layer is a little different and we are divided into two sections.

This paragraph is to ensure that the accuracy of light is incidental to the accuracy and usability of the future. So this piece of FAU is precisely packaged in this PIC. But in this part of the back end. This part is what we are talking about. This part of 3 we put 3 and 1 in this part. This part becomes detachable.

He uses it. The opposite of this is that we transfer the optical fiber behind it. To do this in the form of detachable1, we do this directly in this precise package. assembly to the PIC. This is fixed on the top. The right is fixed on the inside.

He is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One Who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is the One who is

"This is the way of the Lord, and this is the way of the world; walk ye in it, and I will show you the way of the Lord, and the truth shall set you free, and the truth shall set you free, and the truth shall set you free, and the truth shall set you free."

What do we want to offer? So this part of the investment is in advance here. There is a lot of light. There is a good behind us to ask. I would like to ask the LPO and the CPO.

From the point of view of cost or yield. That is to say that guests are willing to choose LPO first, not directly to the main key of the CPO is what is to say. I believe that there will be a year is a key. price cost is also a key.

But why 1. 6T has two solutions. Then it is the guest choice in this regard is what I want to say is that I want to confirm that this LPO is probably more likely than we would be. I imagine that for a long time because I see a gap in the middle of it for at least a year.

The connector. The complexity of his design will be more complex than the complexity of the CO design. Simple and many. The CPO is a model of a design that compares the level of the weaver.

The way the CPO does it is a package. Packaged to the whole. The whole subtrade of Switch Edition or XPU goes up with Coop. Then he does it here. So, although technically difficult, we see it as 1. 6T.

However, the development process of the CPO goes from 1. 6T to 3. 2T to 6. 4T to even higher bandwidth. He will be higher bandwidth is base on the weaver level. A requirement for semiconductors to be designed and developed. That is, from the development point of view to the future AI and high performance community. computing if this product can be developed.

It's here. Mass production verification and system validation can also be evaluated. The development of the whole AI for the future follows high performance. computing will have a big impact when doing this light interlinks. Performance is a space that grows with the whole. That comes from cost because you just ask the question about cost.

The part of the cost is actually the part of the CPO because he is more complex than the LPO, so he really is. His value will be higher than the LPO. The LPO will be higher than the LPO. A range. Because I think that the adoption of switch vendors is actually the same as if I were 1. 6T like you to drive the highway. I

I'm 500 km/h. That's it. Suppose that I have two million cars and five million cars can drive 500 km/h of course I mean. In terms of cost, if the LPO is 1 then the CPO is about to jump at the level of 1. 6T. The part of cost is from 1. 6T. Let's see.

It feels like the LPO of 1. 6T is more economical. But the bandwidth requirement of our AI and high performance has become big. We. If we are using 1. 6T plugable or CPU. 1. 6T is the way to put the peripherals of our switch IC or the peripherals of XPU.

Multicouple followed. A lot of fiber array units. That is to say, his entire system version. The whole plan with him will become larger. So, there will be some use and development of the whole performance.

bottlenecks. So from this perspective in the future. If we look at some of the leading companies in the market. This is the one of the bandwidth of some of the switches that are connected to the market. Development will come from.

102. 4T then runs up. Then he runs up all the time. And when you use only 1. 6T, his entire cost increase will become very large. Then he will be able to follow the performance. This part of his latency will face a relatively large one.

That's why we've been developing this CPO for a long time. The main thing is to solve it. It's one of the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and the speed of future data transmission. It can meet AI and high performance computing. So in the short term, you'll feel like it. 1. The 6T pluggable has the advantage, but if you want to find a solution for a long time.

Are there any investment advances to ask questions? Because of our time relationship, we may only accept the last question. That's what we have to do with the current relationship.

A client or a particular supplier makes a statement about how we compare. From a company point of view, we can compare one direction that we can provide as a whole.

Thank you to the Chief Financial Officer. A warm applause. We were there today. The performance outlook is also here to tell you a very big thank you for your participation today, and today we are also on this Taiwan Smart Technology Island. The theme is that the performance outlook is 25 successful and thank you very much. Whether it is on-site or online investment friends along the way.

Thank you all for your next visit, and thank you all.
