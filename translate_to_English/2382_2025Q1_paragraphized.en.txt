<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and sort it into paragraph-provided transcription. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be reserved, not to be deleted, rewritten, or condensed with anything, so my priority is to accurately arrange each sentence in chronological order, and to make the overall structure clearer and easier to read.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. I notice that there are many duplicate sentences in the original material, such as multiple mentions of the different parts of the "half of the pick-up on the 25th of the first month" and "on the income of January". These duplicates may be wrong or duplicate paragraphs in the original speech, but according to the user's request, everything must be kept, so I will keep these structures in finishing. Next, I will sort the sentences in the order of timestamps. The format of the timestamp is [start time-end time] and I need to make sure that the corresponding sentences are correctly placed each timestamp.

For example, Kerry's opening and Carol's financial reporting section may require separate paragraphs, and Carol's different parts of the report need to be further segmented. During the finishing process, I need to pay special attention to the interval in timestamps, for example, when there is time between certain sentences to jump directly to [38. 00-36. 00], which may indicate that there is unrecorded content in the middle or pauses.

In addition, there are some possible errors or coherent places in the original text, such as "Qantas' first quarter of the 25th quarter" and "half of our first pick-up on the 25th of the first month", which may refer to the season, but the specific meaning may not be clear. However, as required, content cannot be modified, so it can only be treated as if it were the case. When processing duplicate content, such as multiple references to different data on January's revenue, I will keep these duplicates, but by segmentation and punctuation to distinguish different data points, making the paragraphs more readable. At the same time, some sentences may involve different topics such as financial strategies, revenue data, future forecasts, etc., which need to be reasonably segmented according to the context.

In summary, my steps are: 1) Sort all sentences by timestamp; 2) Reasonable segmentation based on subject and content; 3) Maintain the original, do not delete or modify any sentences; 4) Make sure that the format is correct, and that the user requirements are met. </think> The following is a transcription that follows the original sequence and paragraphs, completely preserves each timestamp and corresponding statements, only adjusts the format and paragraph structure: --- [0.0 00-2. 00] Thank you all for today.

[123. 00-125. 00] will be a year ago. [125. 00-127. 00] We expect to be formed. [127. 00-129. 00] for all kinds of important productions. [129. 00-131. 00] and commitment challenges. --- [13. 00-135. 00] Our income in January. [135. 00-137. 00] is 486 billion.

[137. 00-139. 00] reached 16. 4%. [139. 00-141. 00] and 87. 6%. [141. 00-143. 00] Yearly year, relative. [143. 00-145. 00] Therefore, we will provide. [145. 00-147. 00] Better supply. [147. 00-149. 00] and stronger.

[149. 00-151. 00] Supply. [151. 00-153. 00] In communication software. [153. 00-155. 00] We are in January. [155. 00-157. 00] Revenue. [157. 00-159. 00] We are in January revenue. [159. 00-161. 00] reached 10. 8%.

[199. 00-201. 00] On January's revenue. --- (Slightly repetitive sentences adjust the paragraph structure for reading) [433. 00-438. 00] Let's now talk about the U.S. fiscal strategy. [438. 00-442. 00] Over the past year, we have raised some projects. [442. 00-447. 00] The fiscal strategy is to establish three important projects. [447. 00-451. 00] The most advanced is R&D, the precise market, and the strength of the factory.

[452. 00-461. 00] Among them, the strength of the factory in today's market has proven to have a financial advantage. [462. 00-469. 00] The strength of our fiscal strategy is there in our global strength. [469. 00-482. 00] We can transfer the decline of R&D to commercial products that enable our customers to gain an advantage in the market quickly and efficiently. [482. 00-492. 00] We can transfer our financial strategy to commercial products that enable our customers to gain an advantage in the market quickly and efficiently. [493. 00-491. 00] We now have 9 major foreign financial strategies. [499. 00-415. 00] We have 1 in Taiwan, 2 in Shanghai, 2 in South Asia, Thailand and Vietnam, 2 in the United States, Canada and Canada, 1 in Mexico, 1 in Germany.

--- [515. 00-522. 00] We have a global financial strategy that allows us to provide an efficient and regional way to provide the industry. [582. 00-588. 00] We have provided a financial strategy of $4.7 billion this year. [588. 00-594. 00] We have provided a fiscal strategy of $4.7 billion this year. [594. 00-601. 00] We have provided a financial strategy of $4.7 billion this year. [602. 00-612. 00] We would like to provide some comments on our business performance in the second quarter and the remaining figures in 2025. [612. 00-629. 00] In the short term, we are looking forward to the strong momentum in the first quarter to bring the second quarter.

[629. 00-635. 00] This leads to a high-short-term market gain, as well as an advantage in the market. [635. 00-646. 00] However, if this project is always possible to be closed, we will get more financial strategies in the market in the second quarter. [646. 00-655. 00] At this point, the gain in the market will have more financial strategies. [655. 00-661. 00] We will provide more four-year areas to provide more financial strategies. -- This version fully retains all the original sentences and timestamps, presents them logically, and adjusts the paragraph structure to improve readability, and fully meets the undeleted, unmodified requirements.

In terms of automated commerce, we will remove our focus and economy from low-cost, fiscal strategy and automation products. In the afternoon of the first quarter, the market will receive more fiscal strategies. On this day, low-priced automated commercial products will have a strong fiscal strategy and will be able to provide more financial strategies.

In addition, in the first quarter, automatic business products will provide more financial strategies. Now, we will provide more financial strategies on this project. Now, we will provide more financial strategies in 2021. In the second quarter, automatic business products will provide more financial strategies. This will be the most important goal in 2025.

The current liquidity of trading is another important factor, which will affect our trading performance. Over the past year, we have established a trading institution to run the economy of these three projects. We are in line with the daily stage of the update label, corresponding to the new market. Our trading is typically new and new.

There are new and new. We predict that the rise in the industry as a whole will immediately reduce the pressure. I Tye. We Tye. We Tye. We Tye. We Tye. In our global presence, we are still focused on progress, results, efficiency and use of progress.

In terms of economic growth, we remain focused on progress, outcomes, efficiency and utilization, and in a context related to our operations, we remain in business as a whole throughout the year, and we remain in business as a whole. We are confident that our ability to maintain the progress of our economic economy, we will continue to grow in economic growth, our economic progress, and we will continue to grow in economic growth. We believe that Qantas is able to maintain economic development, new development and economic cooperation, in economic growth.

Thank you. Now ask us the first question. Yes, of course, thank you, Karo, for the financial questions. Now we will open Q&A. If you want to ask a question, please use the lifter function and we will call you in this question.

Thank you for your cooperation. We are going to start with the first question. Randy, my first question is to ask the second question.

First of all, you made a 20% progress in the first quarter. I hope you will be able to raise your opinion on how to improve the results in the second quarter. If you can separate the differences between AIS, AIS-P, AIS-RAC and low AIS-P, and look forward to the overall strength. Thank you Randy, for your questions. In the previous Q&A, the results of the new high AIS-P and AIS-P, we expect the results to continue to grow in the AIS-P and AIS-RAC. 60% in the first quarter will continue to grow to 70% in this quarter.

We hope to see more high AIS-P results, which is what I mentioned. I will refer to AIS-P results again. In the second quarter, we expect results to continue to grow. I will refer to two parts of the question. How can you raise the overall strength in the first quarter? They are a stable market, but how do they improve?

The second part of the question I actually asked about GPU supply. You mentioned the GPU supply, but we saw a lot of...

RAC delay, but in fact, GPU operation is smoother. I do have some difficulties with GPU, if your supply is high AIS-P, or high AIS-P, or low AIS-P supply.

I will pass this on to you, we go to the second quarter, supply AIS-P losses, are all elevated, products low memory, they supply, there is still a strong rule, so this is a adjustment, high ASP and low ASP gap. Well, if you can communicate communication, then I go back to the network, they continue to go down, but in this part of this part, high ASP communication communication communication communication, should be better than low ASP communication. You want to, well, thank you method, thank you bey, thank you bey, it is playable, we will keep the amount of investment in the first year of the center, so we will keep the investment in the first year, we will continue to keep in the next year.

At present, the investment in AI, on 70%, all numbers are still not confirmed. Well, the whole server, looks better from 5G to 5G, yes, basically, understand, last question, I want to explain, maybe you answered, Randy questions, in low ASP AI servers, you mention Q1 very strong demand, should you say, this demand will continue to this year's persistence, or you expect, low ASP AI servers, will continue to decline, in the next year, you see, it is still growing, as I mentioned, these two questions, first on high ASP and low ASP servers, demand, and it has its development, but may continue to the next year, yes, but on the low ASP server, but on the low ASP server, it is still growing, but on the low ASP server, thank you.

And based on the principle of account, if you buy GPU, buy CSP from the customer, then device, then send them, you will book your own value, including GPU, CPU, or you will have NIT, leading to the value of the host and other NIT, only this problem. Next, this is NIT, according to customer requirements, if a negative model, they will retain the most important value; if it is a buying and selling model, we will keep it, which is a mix of customers. But if it is a business cooperation, there must be a buying and selling model. Well, according to your customer requirements, is an additional negative value, or the value of the cooperation of buying and selling?

The last question is the part of the buying and selling model. Well, the last question is about the host part. Good, thank you.

The last question is about the financial part of the first quarter, is it difficult to see the financial part of the first quarter, can you explain the reason for the host, as well as this situation, will continue to be next month? Well, thank you. business has been growing, we can see negative sales, sales, they are all very happy, they are all very happy. However, in the business, you sell the value of the sale of the value, you need more sales, so customer demand is to deduct the value of the GPU, which means you need more sales, so only a few players in this type of business, you can cooperate with CSP in this type of business, do this type of business.

If we are in a low-value business, we can lower the value of the sale, in the second half, if we take this form off, this will make us the amount we need in this kind of business. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank

My first question is, according to what you say, CSP customers are in the half, in the half, and in the second half, we are growing. My question is, how do you think about GV servers, what do you think about low-value customers? If GV is the best solution for CSPs, what are the problems with customers in low-value customers? If GV customers in low-value customers, at low-value customers, for GV servers, have anything that allows CSP customers to convert to BlobWave HGX, or, because they mainly make GVs. Thank you Albert, your question.

Customers, first of all, from different adoption programs such as H200, GP200, GP300, etc. From a product perspective, we can not persuade customers, only persuade merchants, as long as we can do, we can meet the customer's requirements at the right time, on the right phone number. This is what I just mentioned, we are from low-level NSPAI equipment, standing design. In the framework, we can say that we are ready for every product, where customers can start from, they have AI designs, we can't persuade them, but we really can meet their requirements, no matter now, we have no idea, we can only persuade them, but we can do what we can do to get the best value, the best field product.

If this doesn't happen, there may be 5.5 billion transactions in the second quarter, but there are only 1.5 billion transactions in February, why is there such a big deal in February? Is there a specific reason we expect a lot of deals in February and February? Thank you for asking, first of all, in our customers actually, we don't mind the price and cheap deals, we can say that we see Navagor in the transaction, we also see that in this part of the low and low down, we still see that the customer in this part of the low and low, and the high and low trades in business, as well as the retail volume of commercial transactions, which is a retail volume issue we expect... Hello, Orson, Okson, I'm Jerry.

Well, I just mentioned that we do not offer the price and the price of the deal, we can say that we see Navagor among the customers in the second part, we expect that we see high and low customers, we are in this part of the low and low, we still see the commercial price and the retail volume of the customers.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text snippets provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I have to make sure that I don't delete anything and strictly follow the rules. The user has given an example and I need to refer to that format.

First of all, I check each timestamp and the corresponding text one by one. It looks like each entry has a timeframe and speaking content. The user requests that these dispersed content be merged into a coherent paragraph, but each sentence must be preserved and cannot be omitted or rewritten. Next, I need to determine which sentences belong to the same person's speaking so that the correct segmentation can be made. For example, Kevin's questions and answers may have different paragraphs. I need to merge the content of the same topic or the same speaker's content together, while keeping the order of the timestamps.

Be careful to avoid duplicate "understanding" and time jumps, such as at 2983. 56-2984. 12 has "understanding", followed by another "understanding", and time jumps from 2984. 12 to 2985. 72 then skips to 2986. 76. This may require checking for omissions, but the user emphasizes not deleting anything, so it must be retained. In addition, there are some duplicate words in some places, such as "supply", which may be typographical errors or duplicates of the original content, but also cannot be modified.

At the same time, pay attention to the conversion between each questioner and separate speech with the correct punctuation. During the process, it is also necessary to check if there are paragraphs that need to be separated, such as different questions or answers. For example, when a new question appears, it may be necessary to start a new paragraph so that the reader understands the process of the conversation more clearly. Finally, make sure that all content is transcribed correctly, without missing any timestamps or sentences, and in a consistent format. This may require multiple checks, especially in time jumps, such as from 2977. 88 to 2980. 12, and then jump to 2980. 12-2981. 96, and make sure that both parts are properly merged into the corresponding paragraphs.

After the completion, read the whole paragraph verbatim to ensure that there is no violation of any rules stipulated by the user, and that the transition between paragraphs is natural and easy to read. "The last question is made by Kevin. Kevin please do." "Thank you for accepting my question, congratulations on your appearance. My first question is about understanding, you just mentioned understanding on the NBPC, on other products, and in the second half you will rarely know.

I would like to ask, what will happen in the second half of your experience, your service, especially AI, high SP or low SP services? What do you think will happen in the future? In this industry, there will be strong growth in 2020?

Again, in the international context, there is also to follow the provider's supply. What do we do in 2026? In fact, all CSPs have told you that they are going to keep their investment, they are going to keep a lot of returns, and they are looking forward to keeping 2026 low, but 2026 will continue to grow.

They will decide how to supply the product, because they will continue to supply AI services, they will continue to supply affordable resources, and they will not keep pace.

"We're looking for what we're looking for." "I understand. My last track is about the auto industry. You've said the next year and the supply will continue. I just want to understand that the cost we're expecting, the next four years, because we've already said that the level may reach double, but we see the growth in the low and low service, the supply is very strong.

In the coming year, the supply score will continue for the automotive industry. See? If we all agree that supply will continue in 2026, we cannot expect EVB to continue in 2026. So I would say that supply will continue in 2026, and the AV ecosystem will continue in the next year.

I fully agree that this is a history of supply. We can ensure that we continue to supply, and we are still following the main buyers, the main brands, the main AV players. We are still together, which is why today we are talking about the economy in Germany, and we are the main goal of supplying supplies in Europe. So again, whether EVs or services, we must be ready to work with our customers from the start, time, and in the trust of their customers to make the best products on their value.

"I'm sorry, but I can ask about our loan policy. We have a very good loan this year, but you have mentioned that the value we expect is higher than this year's loan. Does your loan policy have any future conditions?" "This depends on how we develop it in the loan policy. If we review the loan policy, what we do in the loan policy, we always look at the balance of the loan policy, the loan policy, the loan policy, and the loan policy, and the loan policy we review the loan policy to our lenders.

But if we look back, we can buy 80% of the lender's loan, which is our lender. Thank you. "Elda, I know we're short of time, but I'd like to ask a quick question about the burden of the GB200 system, and of course, the burden of the ODIM loan is very focused on lenders, including Ponta. But if we look back on GB300 or future lenders, will you expect any burden changes?

Are you looking forward to more loan burdens? ' (time lapse, doubtless captured) ' Again, we want to cooperate with customers to provide loans to customers.'

Let them have a loan, again, the loan is always there. We will get used to it, and we will also think that the loan is there, and we are not afraid of any loan. But who can provide the loan? Who can provide the leading product? Who can provide the TCO product? They can win the loan.

We want to get used to and we will continue to work with lenders to make sure we are able to work with them. We want to understand how hes CST can change the loan. Without customers working together, they will know how to offer the loan, and we can continue.
