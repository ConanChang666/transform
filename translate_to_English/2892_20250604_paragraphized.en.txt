<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcripts provided by the user and convert them into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all the original sentences must be retained. This means that I need to check the transcripts one by one to make sure that there are no omissions or modifications. Next, I will look at the transcripts provided.

Each entry has timestamps and content, and I need to organize this content in logical order, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. First, I will identify the subject of each paragraph. For example, the first part discusses the reduction of net reserves and the increase in operating costs, and the next part is the annual and quarterly growth of loan data, and then the loan-to-deposit ratio, spreads, deposit-to-deposit situation, and the details of the loan concentration and mortgage business.

In addition, timestamps may help me understand the order of the content, but the user requests not to delete anything, so timestamps also need to be kept in the final paragraph. During the processing process, I will check it every step of the way to ensure that each sentence is placed correctly and the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, when moving from an annual data to a quarterly data, a new paragraph may be required to start. At the same time, note the accuracy of the numbers and percentages to avoid errors during the conversion process. Finally, I will read the paragraph-based script after the entire conversion, confirming that all the original sentences have been included, no omissions or errors, and the format conforms to the user's requirements.

For the 2024 dividends, total payouts were about 66.3%, with cash paid at 52. 5%, subject to June AGM's approval. Now, to Keith for Q&A session. As the U.S. cryptocurrency revenues may not be sufficient, this also helps us to grow on FX trading and also helps us to grow on FX trading as well as the overall investment size and the original forecast. Thank you Amy for the current U.S. cryptocurrencies timeline we think and we also anticipate our first four months of trading earnings so we anticipate our four months trading gains up to 1.03 to 1.04 Eric also want to know that our management team has set up our budget, such as the additional income and income parts of the investment economy, that we have made some comprehensive investment compositions, the form of balloons, our income is low, so we have our annual income from around 7% to 5% of revenue, and other parts of our income businesses, including SMB, FX accounts, we still maintain similar growth as the first half, while our FX accounts remain strong in the company's supply market revenue and re-growing to 10%, so our FX accounts are still up to 15% as well as we are expected to 15% as well as well as well as well as we are expected to the next year's, and we are expected to 10% of our earnings in our earnings in the year.

At present, some people are concerned about the needs of U.S. investors and are worried that they will transfer their investment objectives to U.S. investors. These investors will help us to make better investments in the future. We still see U.S. investors investing in domestic companies, as we say, companies, we actually see our company investments grow from young people to young people, which will help us to make better investments in these companies.

It will definitely be slightly slightly, but it will remain around 7%. It will certainly be slightly, but growth will grow in the second half. So I think it is important that the growth of growth investments in domestic markets and in the region. We will grow investments in the second half. We will grow investments in the second half. We will grow investments in the second half.

We will grow the investment in the second half. Because Eric also, because Eric, on our 20 pages, on our 20 pages, our fees, because we, our fees, have grown. He knows that because of our fees, we have Taiwan high-speed line, Taiwan high-speed line, US$5.6 billion, so this is our fees, why our fees are growing.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript:. I can explain these results more. Currently our lives are in foreign investment stocks, the value of 1.1Bit is a relatively small value. They are actually 80% of foreign investment, which means that 20% of the value is still open. These are foreign investment stocks of 1Bit, and the reduction in value of each 1Bit is a result of a 20 billion dollar trade reduction, as it is added to the position of about $20 billion.

To date, our lives have been invested almost $18 billion in FX. Almost $18 billion in FX. Almost $18 billion in FX investment. However, these funds have a $3, or a 2-5 dollar amount. $3 is from $30.5 to $30. To date, this represents a 8% reduction in US debt.

So we have covered the most Fx storage items in this pandemic. So two months ago, we had a lot of failures. The level of failure is even more profound. But frankly, because our goods are worth more than two billion dollars, the emergence of U.S. currencies. So I guess the decline in U.S. currency can be slightly slower, as it has already reduced by nearly 8% to 10%.

So, these reductions can be considered feasible because its growth position is only $20 billion. So if the U.S. currency continues to decrease, to $28, the reduction of each dollar will produce a $20 billion reduction. So, the reduction of each dollar will result in a $20 billion reduction. To that end, as well as the reduction of the U.S. dollar, OK, so, 200 million NT dollars, every one dollar US depreciation OK, every one dollar US depreciation, it cost 200 million NT dollars loss. OK, And Annie answered another Eric's question that we will apply to new FX reserves,right?

Yes. And so far is no more question coming in, so maybe if you have any questions, you can type your questions at the button box of the webcast. And in the meantime, maybe Annie tells us about the difference. Because everyone knows that in April and May, the world is changing a lot. So, maybe our projections for the 2020 and 2021 2025 may change a little bit. And maybe Annie concludes some of our strategies for the quarters for this year.

Well, as we are still in the ongoing mode to see how the tech impact and the tightened regulation in US investment How will that impact the real world? Yeah. So, I think we have to think about the future. Yeah. I think the future is not the real world. But for banks and our team, we will face any potential impact.

We have very small exposures to U.S. government bonds, which accounts for less than 6% of our overall overseas portfolio. Therefore, risk can be considered controllable. In terms of exposure to corporate departments, we should be more cautious about how it affects, not from tariffs, but actually the exchange rate.

So, I think we need to keep an eye on this. But so far, the quality of assets remains good. So, we should see how this develops and we will continue to see how we treat this very dynamic and changing world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
