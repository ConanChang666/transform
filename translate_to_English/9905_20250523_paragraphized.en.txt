The first part is financial information, including the 2025 business focus, the first quarter's financial report, the first quarter's revenue, the first quarter's revenue, and so on. The first quarter's financial report shows that the first quarter's revenue in 2025 was $19,65246,000 yuan, an increase of 1.8% from the same quarter last year, up 10. 93% from the previous quarter.

The main reason for the growth in the first quarter is that Taiwan's revenue increased by 547 million and the growth rate was 11.5%. China is a small recession, which is 10.93% higher than the same period last year because the fourth quarter is usually the low period of the industry, so the customer's orders will be more conservative, so the first quarter of this year's revenue will increase from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter.

Part of Taiwan rose from 24% in the first quarter to 27%, mainly because Taiwan's revenue grew in the first quarter, while China's revenue declined. Next, look at the quarterly gross profit and consolidated gross profit margin. The first quarter of gross profit was 11.7 billion:193,000 dollars, a decrease of 13. 86% from the same quarter last year, a decrease of 11.3% from the previous quarter.

Gross profit margin is 8. 66%, which is also a new low in the quarter. The first quarter of the operating fee is 11.18 million yuan, which is 6.25% higher than the same quarter last year, and 2.79% lower than the previous quarter. The cost rate is maintained at 5. 66%, which is probably our normal level, probably between 4.5 and 6.5. Net profit margin is 3%, which is a decrease of 36.5% and 23.85 per cent, respectively, from the same quarter last year and the fourth quarter respectively. The main reason for a significant reduction in net profit is the decrease in gross profit margin.

The net profit after tax, net profit after tax, and net profit after tax, and 40,000, are the net interest rates for the same period of the year, which are 17,000 yuan, a decrease of 29. 14% and 21. 79% respectively, compared with the same period and the fourth quarter of the year. Net interest rate is 3. 67%.

The total asset has increased by 58.39 million, the total liability has decreased by 5971 million, and the equity of shareholders increased by 1.1 billion. Mainly, the reserve surplus has increased by 74.5 million, as well as the evaluation adjustment of exchange rates. With the significant appreciation of Taiwan Dollar in the second quarter and the significant volatility in the financial markets, the adjusted portion of this assessment may be partially destroyed.

The main reason is because we have increased the share of large customers from the second quarter of last year compared to the same period last year by about 3%, and the total revenue revenue revenue is increased from the same period last year. The actual customer's payment status is normal, and there is no abnormal error period. Next is the part of the inventory weekly rate, also from last year's 4.17 to 4.6, indicating that our inventory is in good control. The above is the first quarter of the financial report.

In 2024, the overall demand for travel increased by a high number compared to 2023.

## Script finishing. **High-level management talk**. Above the overall growth rate of the economy. Growth of the economy itself leads to growth in consumption. The inertia rate of breweries continues to increase. Change in consumption habits.

A step up to environmental awareness. Expect the entire industry in the future. Every year it will still be slightly higher than the growth of the overall growth rate of the economy. The price competition in the industry is still ongoing.

We estimate that the price of our products will continue to be in this low profile. Next is the focus of our operations in 2025. Part of Taiwan will continue to diversify our products. Buy customer needs. Taiwan market is mature and stable. Through the diversification of our products.

There are currently 250 330 Slicks and 330 Slicks available. 350 500 base tanks. There are then 200 and 250M molded wheels, as well as a variety of aluminum lids and DRD iron cans.

In addition, we will continue to promote the energy saving and carbon reduction part. We have set up an orderly development committee. We have continued to promote the energy saving and carbon reduction part. We have also started to replace some energy-saving equipment. Then, we switched to high-energy generators, etc., and to reduce the energy consumption of the unit.

We continue to strengthen the management within the company. Maintain market competitiveness. And continue to improve the process of production. Increase the ability to profit. The mainland part is due to the large market.

Then it is still in the stage of growth. But because the competition is too intense. The competition in price is too intense. So we have to maintain our internal management. Increase our production capacity. Then increase our realistic rate of our customers.

There is only one place in this market. Maintaining our ability to continue to expand in mainland China. The second is the part of the process of improvement. We hope through the development of various technologies. That increases our shield than the amount of production. And then lowers our costs.

We will increase our profitability, like a key point in 2025. Next, we will proceed with QA. **Q&A** There is a problem here. A problem is mentioned.

The exchange rate of Taiwan Dollar is affected by the company. Currently, it is because of the wave of May. The exchange rate of that Taiwan Dollar is actually very volatile. It has a certain impact on all walks of life.

So basically our raw materials are imported. So basically our raw materials are imported. So basically it is imported. So basically, if the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar is a direction of appreciation.

So our import costs will be reduced. That import costs will be reduced. Relatively speaking, because the raw material is our entire cost structure. Or the relatively high portion. So if the Taiwan dollar exchange rate rises.

We are more favorable to this part of our industry. That is, because we have some of that. That is, some of the parts of the US dollar. Some parts of the US dollar. There may be some losses.

In addition, it is part of the continent. If the yuan is weaker than the Taiwan dollar, it is possible for us to adjust some of the exchange rates. The cumulative variable adjustment portion will also have some effect.

Another question to ask is whether the U.S. implements an equivalent tariff measure has an impact on the operation of your company. Regarding this part of the U.S. to raise tariffs. We can say from several perspectives. That is, the direct impact is in fact due to the fact that our company's current main focus customers.

Most of them are local. Also, there may be a small part of Taiwan China. Exports from Southeast Asia. That for the United States. That percentage is probably less than one percent of revenue. At present, there are only two customers.

There may be several perspectives. The first one is if the economy as a whole is. Because this Trump implements this peer duty. This is for example, Taiwan's growth rate. Or the mainland China's growth rate.

This part may affect the attitude of everyone to consume. It may have some effect on this demand, that is, we are the other customers. They may have some terminal products. For example, drink. This juice.

These are the things that are sold to the U.S.A. This is also the part that may be affected by tariffs. This is because beer and juices are the things that are not picked up by the people.

And it may be for. That is, the price is more sensitive. If it causes demand for it. That is because of adjusting tariffs. If the price increases in the middle of the price, it is possible that consumers will choose brands within the United States.

That or that. If we ask our customers to absorb these tariffs, it may be that their profits are too poor. They may also affect the hospitals they continue to export to the United States. This section will also reduce some production. But these parts are probably not very high proportions.

So I don't think the impact on us should be too serious. Yes, that's the last one. The impact of China's CO2 packaging and Orijin's merger on the market. That part I can ask the overseas manager to answer.

That's why we know that the COFCO merger with Orikini is the first and third largest after the merger. Their market share is nearly 40% what we know now. That's how they impact and react more than five. That's what we're paying attention to on the market.

So we see this question now. So the focus is on it. And that's what we're paying attention to. And that's what they're talking about, even though the market has a big impact on the market.

Then there is the relative customer. For example, some big beer companies or Hanxi companies that sell drinks. They have a certain influence on the size of the market. So that won't make it. The first big changeover companies do some negative effects. I think that part will continue to observe.

This is our analysis. Thank you. There is no further problem at this time. Our law today will continue. Our program is over. Thank you.
