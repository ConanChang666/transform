Well, that's great to hear from you today. We attended the original Vice President's Spring Forum. The first one we had today was the invitation. Gorgeous Lin Zhenquan IR. And the zodiac sign of life.

Thank you so much for your support. We will be back in the future. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your support.

Advanced Legislature. Come and listen to the presentation of our gorgeous company. I don't have to wait any longer. Let's start today's presentation. The first few pages will be ours. Some of the company's basic profile.

Introduction to basic information about the company. Then we have some of the major product portfolios. That's because there are still some possibilities today. First time to listen to our company briefings on the advanced. Finally the possible part of the product. I'll still be advanced.

I will make further explanations. Then I will proceed to the next stage. These are some reports on financial figures. There are also shareholder returns, etc. Some important indicators of the company. Good.

As I have just reported to you, I'd like to introduce some basic information about our company. It's been 57 years since its inception. So it's all about the listed industry, or some of the information in the currency industry.

The first question that so many investors may think of is, why should we have a channel. Why should we have a role as a gorgeous channel. I'll have a slide later. I'll introduce you to some of the added value of our main gorgeous.

Our so-called value proposition. To bring value propositions to suppliers and customers. What exactly are our value-added services? Let's take a look at a few more. That's basically our company now. Share capital if you have long-term follow-up.

It should be understood that our share capital had slightly expanded a little bit last year. It was probably less than 10% of the expansion. That's because it was about 4 years ago. It should now count as 4 years ago. We have issued a $2 billion CD. The CD issued a $2 billion CD last year in 2024.

That CD issued a $2 billion CD last year in 2024. The entire conversion was completed. So the capital was followed by more than $23 billion. It was now grown to $2.5 billion. Of course, the share capital increased.

In fact, as the stock price slowly rises, our market capitalization is also slowly growing. So you can see that portion of the Nautica market capitalization is nearly $1 billion. It is a billion USD. We have some movement in the stock price right now.

So it may be around 920 million right now. It's about USD 912. This is our market value. In fact, we think of a billion. A market value of 1 billion dollars is a good size for a market cap. Because it's an investment in a lot of foreign capital.

In short, it is a threshold for basic investment. We hope to continue to maintain the market value of the company. It can not be more than a billion dollars, so we can introduce more foreign investors to come in. Our stock price is more growth and stability.

There is also liquidity that can be increased. Then there is our company. In the future, there are several major drivers of growth. The object on this page should be here. So I think everyone already knows this AI. This is the one that drives all the technology products in the technology industry.

I think it's a huge growth. I want to see some products in our gorgeous place. Of course, the first thing I want to think about is that AI sells the egg industry directly. I think of Taiwan's account Shenshan. The whole egg conductor supply chain requires the upstream raw materials.

We can say that gorgeous is the most complete total solution provider. Therefore, the continuous evolution of high-end egg conductors here is very helpful for gorgeous. Because not only the advanced process products will be mentioned, but the amount will also rise in the continuous direction.

This is the introduction of the egg conductor that I would like to make further progress. It is probably a basic introduction of some of our growth function sources. The first is, of course, the high-end egg conductor. Of course, it has been said a lot. And then there are some materials in PCB IC Taiwan.

Yes. Japanese imports. Some so-called ballistic PCB printed circuit boards or the supplies of motherboards. We are gorgeous here also have a corresponding import agent for some of the products of rubber removal. Of course, AI has just talked about it. There is also a so-called next-generation electronics.

We have a large amount of revenue now. Basically, this is what you are talking about. This is basically what you are talking about. This is basically what you are talking about. This is what you are talking about. This is basically what you are talking about. This is what you are talking about. This is basically what you are talking about.

This is the word of God, which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God, and which is the word of God.

The amount of revenue is relatively large. There is also a certain amount of growth contribution to the growth of our revenue. Also like 5G. I want everyone to know. I don't mention it anymore. Then like.

This is the future of electric vehicles. Material for electric vehicles. We also have a lot of corresponding materials in the supply. Then proceed the following. This is one of the revenue contributions above the region.

I updated to January 2025. It was just a picture of the whole year last year. Because of the previous one. Maybe it was an introduction to the whole year last year. But I don't think it's much different. That's the part of the picture in the bottom right corner.

I'm here first to show us a January. A break down in Geographical. You can see this one in the lower right corner. Taiwan is probably still a major revenue contributor. About 55% of our revenue is there.

There are still a lot of industries that are still growing. So about 40% of them are still growing. And then about 10% of the rest comes from what we call it. East Asia is Asia. Southeast Asia is the country of ASEAN. Including all of this Vietnam.

Thailand Singapore Malaysia. Philippines. We've all been there for a long time. Then there's sales. That's because of geopolitical relations. So there's the so-called transportation.

This is called a production wind. The production line is a phenomenon of dispersion of risks, so the growth of the southeast is getting better and better.

We have sales offices in the north and south. Then we also plan to go to Kaohsiung. It is already in progress. Then it is about to complete a Southern Logistics Center. It is also to meet the needs of our customers. We expand our capacity in the south.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. In fact, we are not a manufacturing company. So our capacity can be one way to explain this so-called storage logistics ability.

Another important point is that there is something about how big customers like us go to Japan, Japan and the United States. There are also some packages that we can provide to our customers. Customers can already get shopping and start using it. This is a simple introduction to the area at the moment. So I just mentioned that a lot of investors may be seeing our so-called gorgeous cargo dealer for the first time will ask why.

By clicking on the “OK” button, you agree to the use of cookies on this website. For additional information, please see our privacy policy.

The first thing you can see is that there are three small heads on our logo on the screen. This is what we call it MV1 engineers. In fact, these MV1 engineers are our gorgeous sales engineers. Fortunately, our gorgeous sales staff are some specialists with technical background knowledge.

So whenever we have new materials from our Japanese suppliers who want to quit and want to introduce them to the Taiwan market or this big Donghua market, then our sales engineers will go to Japan to do the erotic products or some of the corresponding erotic parameters of the raw materials, or how to adjust the yield and formula, as well as the IP knowledge, etc. After the training is complete, our erotic sales engineers can help our customers to do this on behalf of erotic products. Because we all know that when the raw materials are to be imported from the upstream, you may need to add a lot of parameters to his knowledge and his entire so-called IP intelligence.

This is why the role of the erotic supplier and the customer is such a gorgeous middleman is valuable to him. Because after all, erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic

This is the first thing we do that is that we create this so-called warehouse warehouse and warehouse system in Taiwan. We have the corresponding warehouse warehouse and warehouse warehouse in the main location of all our customers, then this warehouse salesman and inventory are close to the customer's production location. So we can do this service called newry, then this is another thing to say that the supplier in Taiwan does not have to set up their own warehouse or logistics system for their own products, because if a supplier himself came here to sell the products he wanted to create this warehouse, the unit cost must be relatively high, because he only sells his own products, but it corresponds to the cost of the same if we focus all of the products in our warehouse, whether the warehouse or the unit of the logistics. This is a simple economic concept.

There is another benefit to being a supplier is that the supplier only targets a gorgeous customer, then our door-to-door approach will be better than the direct customer can turn into a door-to-door approach. We may also introduce our at-a-glance account payable until about 45 days. For example, if the supplier wants to face the customer directly, some customers may need to be in a hurry for 90 days or even 120 days.

This is also the need to rely on the lens, we import such optical-grade plastic from Japan, then a lot of supply to customers from Taiwan and the mainland, I think you should also know that there is a large optical-lens module factory in the mainland, which is one of our top five customers, we sold them a lot of this optical-grade plastic, so that they can do a variety of lens modules, such as TVs, mobile phones, some cameras in the car, some lenses in the environment test lenses, etc., this application is more and more, so we have another driver in the high-end engineering plastic. Because of the demand of PCDE, the number of layers of PCDE is also more and more, whether going to the HDI version or Any Layer or Multi Layer, the number of layers of PCDE boards has arrived, I remember that it has reached more than thirty-four layers of such high-end boards. The requirements of each board, its Servitude, the line width of the line, are getting more and more detailed, so you need to use our high-end ink in the exposure process, you can use this fine circuit diagram, take this photosortial, exposure process to the Inframe to this printed circuit board, so we need to use our Asahi Nashieh high-level ink to achieve this purpose, so the application of Driving here is the revenue is increasing with the day, this first product, the second, the second, the Holypoint of the high-level board, that is basically called CCL, and we all know that Taiwan.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to see if there are any obvious formatting problems or discrepancies in timestamps. For example, some timestamps may be duplicated or incorrect, for example, in [2473. 06-2474. 06] and [2474. 06-2475. 06], the "learning materials" are repeated four times, which may be duplicated in the original recording, which needs to be kept as it should be. Next, I need to reorganize the phrases that are phrased in sequence.

For example, from [1971. 06-1974. 06] to [2490. 06], the timestamp of each sentence must correspond correctly and cannot be interrupted in order. In addition, the user refers to "do not delete any sentence", so even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant, it must be retained. For example, when introducing a light barrier, the JSR supply is repeated several times, which must be retained in paragraphs.

In addition, check if there are typographical or syntax errors, but the user requests do not change, so even if there are errors must be retained. During the process, you may encounter a connection problem between sentences, such as time stamp jumps large, but must be strictly arranged according to the time stamp. For example, there is a time interval between [2073. 06-2079] and [2080. 06-2085. 06], but according to the time stamp, you must keep the original order. Finally, after the initial draft, you need to read the whole paragraph typed text to ensure that all sentences are correctly classified, no omissions or misplaced, and that all the user's requirements are clearly separated.

Ensure that the final output meets the user's needs and maintains the integrity and accuracy of the original content. </think> The following is a paragraph-by-slip transcription following a re-arrangement of the original transcription (completely retains all original sentences, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed): --- [1971. 06-1974. 06] Panasonic is a Japanese medium-sized Mashita. [1978. 06-1980. 06] This high-end currency substrate. [1980. 06-1982. 06]

[1982. 06-1987. 06] It has the so-called above text also mentions the so-called low-intermediate electrons. [1987. 06-1991. 06] There is another feature called low-impedance. [1991. 06-1992. 06] English is called Low Detail. [1992. 06-1994. 06] Low Detail followed Low Df. [1994. 06-2000. 06] These characteristics of the flux substrates can only be applied to high-end servers. [2000. 06-2003. 06] or high-end communication equipment.

[2003. 06-2009. 06] Because these high-end applications require very low dielectricity. [2009. 06-2012. 06] Low dielectricity and low impedance. [2012. 06-2015. 06] This is how it is done when the data is transmitted. [2015. 06-2018. 06] There is no data loss. [2018. 06-2020. 06] or high heat is generated. [2020. 06-2021. 06] These materials have these.

[2021. 06-2026. 06] Our material can provide such a high-quality feature. [2026. 06-2032. 06] We do not have this data loss. [2032. 06-2034. 06] Rate is also low. [2034. 06-2040. 06] Then this so-called high-temperature phenomenon will also be lower. [2040. 06-2049. 06] This is why our Panasonic CCL is also a high-end printed circuit board. [2049. 06-2050. 06] In the production of AI Server.

[2050. 06-2055. 06] or this high-end communication equipment required for the flux substrate. [2055. 06-2064. 06] The PCB manufacturers on the market have adopted almost all of our flux substrates. [2064. 06-2068. 06] To do their high-end PCB. [2068. 06-2073. 06] This is the introduction of PCB. [2073. 06-2079. 06] The second block is red here is our semiconductor factory. [2080. 06-2085. 06] I think this may be an application area that everyone is interested in.

[2085. 06-2090. 06] We can actually say that we are a so-called supplier of a full range of services for the upstream raw materials of semiconductors. [2090. 06-209. 06] All the raw materials of the upstream customers. [2103. 06-2105. 06] Whether chemical or gas. [2105. 06-210. 06]

[2110. 06-2112. 06] All are available. [2112. 06-2114. 06] The chemical part. [2114. 06-2120. 06] There are several major chemicals that can be seen inside the head. [2120. 06-2122. 06] Includes optical resistance. [2122. 06-2124. 06] Here is the third Bluepoint. [2124. 06-2126. 06] There is a so-called optical resistance.

[2126. 06-2128. 06] Chemicals of the electronic machine. [2128. 06-2130. 06] Then virtual light resistance. [2130. 06-2130. 06] Then CMP grinding fluid. [2132. 06-2135. 06] Mainly applied to grinding fluids in the same process. [2135. 06-2139. 06] In addition, we also supply this special device. [2139. 06-2144. 06] Then there are components of this component.

[2144. 06-2153. 06] The demand for this advanced packaging material of our customers in the near future is increasing. [2153. 06-2157. 06] So we also supply advanced packaging materials. [2157. 06-2116. 06] I briefly introduce our photoresist liquid. [2161. 06-2116. 06] There is also a grinding liquid. [2162.0 06-2165. 06] And this advanced packaging material. [2165. 06-2168. 06] These are from Japan.

[2169. 06-2172. 06] is the process of JSR. [2172. 06-2178. 06] So we are JSR's Focal Resist optical impedance. [2178. 06-2182. 06] is the customer may reach 3nm. [2184. 06-2186. 06] These advanced optical impedances [2184. 06-2186. 06] include Legacy optical impedance.

[2188. 06-2192. 06] is a relatively old process of maturing photoresist liquid. [2192. 06-2195. 06] All of our products are also available here. [2195. 06-2198. 06] Our photoresist liquid comes from JSR. [2198. 06-2202. 06] The JSR also provides a heavy product is a grinding liquid. [2202. 06-2206] The grinding liquid is also a very important product. [2206. 06-2212. 06] This is an advanced packaging material that I just reported to you.

[2212. 06-2215. 06] Advanced packaging materials last year. [2215. 06-2220. 06] It was only last year that this single product advanced packaging material itself. [2220. 06-2223. 06] It was almost 100% growth. [2223. 06-2227. 06] This is why it is visible to customers on advanced packaging materials. [2228. 06-2232. 06] The relatively low growth rate of demand is very high. [2232. 06-2236. 06]

[2236. 06-2243. 06] The JSR is basically the three main products that I just mentioned. [2243. 06-2246. 06] The other is like the chemicals of electronics. [2246. 06-2251. 06] This we are in Mitsubishi Chemical, Japan. [2251. 06-2255. 06] Some of the chemicals of electronics of Sanyin Chemical, Japan. [2255. 06-2257. 06] Contains something about acid and alkaline. [2258. 06-2261. 06]

[2261. 06-2266. 06] It is also an indispensable raw material in the first half of life. [2266. 06-2268. 06] It is like a special gas. [2268. 06-2270. 06] I just talked to you. [2270. 06-2275. 06] Special gas we except in Taiwan. [2275. 06-2282. 06]

[2288. 06-2292. 06] Special gas parts are already available. [2292. 06-2296. 06] For Japanese customers, Japan and the United States products. [2296. 06-2303. 06] The semiconductor I want its growth. [2303. 06-2305. 06] I don't need to explain it anymore. [2305. 06-2308. 06] Everyone should have enough information. [2308. 06-2312. 06]

[2312. 06-2315. 06] or even this 6G in the future. [2315. 06-2318. 06] Everyone is ready to talk about 6G. [2318. 06-2320. 06] This semiconductor demand. [2320. 06-2322. 06] This semiconductor chip. [2322. 06-2326. 06] Whether it is Logic IC graphics chip GPU. [2326. 06-2331. 06] or later this may require an ASIC.

[2334. 06-2333. 06] This ASIC IC. [2333. 06-2339. 06] These will shock the demand for some outputs in this semiconductor. [2339. 06-2343. 06] So gorgeous this side of the supply of a full range of raw materials. [2343. 06-2345. 06] The raw materials for the semiconductor. [2345. 06-2347. 06] This release of the materials. [2347. 06-2353. 06] We will benefit from a growth in this technology.

[2353. 06-2359. 06] The other is on this column chart. [2359. 06-2361. 06] The green block on the top. [2361. 06-2364. 06] I write here is AptoElectronics. [2364. 06-2365. 06] Photoelectric products. [2365. 06-2368. 06] It is basically a flat-panel display product. [2368. 06-2371. 06] The flat-panel display product.

[2371. 06-2376. 06] We are here mainly to provide a flat-screen display. [2376. 06-2378. 06] Upstream to downstream all products. [2378. 06-2380. 06] We are all available. [2380. 06-2381. 06] Includes upstream this panel. [2384. 06-2387. 06]

[2387. 06-2389. 06] This article. [2389. 06-2391. 06] We also offer. [2391. 06-2393. 06] Includes like colored beams. [2393. 06-2395. 06] Includes like this. [2395. 06-2393. 06] Some packets Panel. [2397. 06-2399. 06] Acid-based stuff.

[2399. 06-2402. 06] We also have this supply. [2402. 06-2405. 06] The other way we are in the panel class. [2405. 06-2408. 06] From the way to the midstream to the downstream. [2408. 06-2411. 06] The midstream.

So, we want to build another big logistics center in the south of Tainan. We can build up the next big logistics center in Tainan. We can move the materials to the local customers, to the southern ones, and to the Southern ones, we are going to expand the production of the customers. The project includes, above this area, we will cover 7 warehouses, and even there are warehouses, because we know some of the chemicals of this electronic machine, they need to be stored in a refrigerated storage environment, so there are 7 of them, one of them will be a refrigerated warehouse, and there are some other ones.

In fact, this is our logistics center, in the southern part of the logistics center, in addition to the can move to work, service to us, the original customers, in fact, we have also done market research, in the southern part of the factory, they do not correspond, warehousing and logistics, this system, so we have set up such a very professional, because we are in the logistics, warehouse experience here, the accumulation of very deep, so we can also provide corresponding services to the third party, is actually our customers, except our customers, if they need storage, storage or logistics system, he can also use, can outsource to us, this southern part of the logistics center. So this Southern logistics center, his strategy, we can not only consolidate our original, customer relationship with us, we can do, other third parties, this business.

In the next week, we should announce the year, the revenue, the number of the year's earnings, please wait a bit. This page refers to our several, the main outside income, the equity law are the source of the income, which includes, everyone should also be very, very can be detailed this Changhua material, and then, we with Japan Nagase, a joint venture specializing in the sale of strange engineering plastics, which is also targeted by, very unique market, because the strange engineering plastic, is a lot of 3C products.

One of the specifications of a binding is that it must not be used. This strange engineering plastic should not be used. So this is also a very stable one. Profitable common source.

This parent Hua plastic. There is another one. There is also a Huahong new technology on the exchange. This is also our. equity law investment company. That is basically.

We have been given the gift of life every year, and we have been given the gift of life, and we have been given the gift of life, and we have been given the gift of life.

Long-term E-Less Income This is what we do every year. This is stable. It comes from these transfer companies. EY earnings.

It's all about financial reporting. I think everyone. I want to look at the report myself. Everyone should be able to see more clearly than I am.

That's pretty obvious. That's basically what I'm talking about. I don't have much to say anymore.

As you can see, by the third quarter of last year, our stock is about $4.9 billion, in fact, less than a month.

The amount of revenue, because last year's revenue, the amount is about $6.7 billion a month.

Revenue: NT$67 billion in revenue. Our inventory is close to 5 billion. Maybe it's because of the relationship at the end of the quarter.

The customer just picked up the goods. So so called a little bit. It doesn't fit our normal. Our stock should still be in stock for more than a month. The amount of sales to a month.

Stocks. That's probably the case. That's another thing to mention, so-called debt ratios. Our debt ratios have also decreased since 2023.

Our total debt ratio is 53% in 2024. Less than 54%. 3. 8% is our financial structure.

It is the year of our Lord's birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth, the year of our birth.

The following is a paragraph-by-word transcription after re-routing:. Our operating expenses are actually trendy, because our operating expenses are basically human cost, which is the part of the salary and the remuneration of the Raymong. The corresponding part is relatively fixed, that is, each of us, each of our sales staff and the members of this Sales Team, each of his per capita revenue can gradually increase, but the user's expenses do not need to synchronize with the amount of revenue to increase. So we will enjoy a so-called fine-scale benefit in the operating expenses, so OPEX is the operating expenses can have a trend downward, this is likely.

That's probably here, today is more of a briefing for me, thank you all for your investment.
