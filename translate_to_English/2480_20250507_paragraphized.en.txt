All investors are welcome to join us today. The first session of the 114th year of the company.

First, introduce the company's management team today. Vice President of Huang Xinqi, and agent spokesperson Yu Chun-chun vice president. Welcome vice president and vice president. Next time. Vice President.

The next time, we asked the Deputy General Manager for a briefing of the company. The second half was open for everyone to ask. There is the Deputy General Manager. Thank you. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you for the invitation.

Also, thank you for investing in advanced equipment. Attended the corporate briefing session in the first quarter of 114. I am Huang Xinqi. Our original spokesperson was Mr. Chu Ruihua. He retired because of his age.

So the son took up the position. The former vice-president's position was due to the vice-president's appointment. Today, we are going to report to you both.

First of all, I will focus on some of the company's comparison strategies and business direction. Let's do some brief reports. As for the numbers of financial and some sales performance. I will ask the deputy to report to you. Well, let's get started. This is a disclaimer.

Please take a look at the troubles. The focus is on all the data that is the most up to date. Or please invest in advance to visit. Public Information Observation Post System announcement. Because technology has been improving.

So there will be some changes. The division has been over 32 years. Since its inception, it has been more than 32 years. So it is a very long company. It has always been focused on system integration. We have an average of more than 1600activates a year.

It is active. In trading, the customer is about an average of this number. All fields. For example, the field is actually composed of something like. What professional high-tech manufacturing telecommunications.

We have more than 40 agents. The whole Worldwide is probably the top three solution. All of this also makes us. We run the result of the past 30 years. Let all the originals.

They are looking for partners in the region of Taiwan. They think of us first. Our company vision is to help our customers. Usually our customers are also the information department of the customer unit.

Help them become like us. Target their customers. They are also generally used to provide IT services. This is a corporate governance evaluation. Please refer to it. Probably our 11th year in 113.

We're probably down from 21% to 35%, it's been a few years, it's probably been that way, we've got it.

Whether it's our customers, or our many awards, our suppliers. First of all, report to you. Some of the awards that a few of our customers have given us.

Most are following. ESG-related. The company also has taken a lot of effort. Some of the ESG categories that are required for ESG and comply customers are working on.

It is as if I have forgotten the name of the Lord, but I have not seen the name of the Lord, nor the name of the Lord, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts, nor the name of the Lord of hosts.

We've split up a few categories. First of all, it's related to the system. These providers are mainly related to the sales system in Taiwan. This is probably HP, or Cisco. Dell IBM, these manufacturers.

As long as it is with these original suppliers, there is a partnership. Usually, our sales results are the first, so there are many.

This is the system product. And this is the comparison. Data management. The so-called data management is done as a backup. The storage of data.

There are also external sources of data, etc. That comes from many houses. This is the manufacturer of data management software as the main character of Vim. Other companies like this are more biased.

I'm talking about this networking mainly refers to data networking. Data networking is our general campus or enterprise. This data network is used inside. It's not a telecommunications network. Another thing about telecommunications network.

These vendors are most likely to be the key player on the data network right now. Luba, like HP. Cisco, of course, has been around for years. It's standing in the leader's position. There are also other switches like HP16.

There is a lot of safety in my message. I have been in it for a long time. From the past to the future, I believe. He will be an unstoppable industry.

This is done by artificial intelligence. Whether good or bad will be better or worse. This is inevitable. So between the studios. Will. Continue to make this information security industry flourish.

That's what many of our agents do with security-related products. These are some of the originals that we have. Some of them are clever. Included are Cisco, Paloto Growthstripe Citrix, and so on. Next is also security-related stuff.

F5 Checkpoint Cisco OpenTex 4DNet Cyborg contains a wide range of security features. Firewalls include web firewalls. These are also included.

That's it. Network related can be transparent. Control. And many others. And that's probably what we do like. Hyperconverged all-in-one.

That's the storage it contains. Including computer is what we calculate. Including the network. etc. Integration of some related products.

I don't know why. It's a company. It's a company I can't remember the price right now is USD. It's a blue screen for USD440-450 a while ago.

This is a very strong company, and when they had a small package, they caused this machine to crash.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. That's actually their device or their system is still running. [487. 88-491. 46]. But Microsoft is gone. [491. 72-493. 00].

[493. 78-497. 36]. The company is now very strong in this endpoint service is not the first place or the second place. [497. 62-500. 18]. They have so many partners abroad in the world these international vendors. [503. 54-506. 10]. The only one listed here is our correspondence.

You can see the bottom right corner. [508. 66-511. 48]. We are one of the largest partners he sells in Taiwan. [516. 60-519. 42].

[524. 28-530. 48]. Our technical aspects of things have been perfected. [535. 34-536. 36]. But we have to do something to manage the face. What we have to do with the face is, of course, to pass ISO27001. [538. 14-541. 48].

ISO27001 is part of the international standard, then CNS27001 is a public sector version of Taiwan that some departments will require. [546. 86-551. 22]. In fact, basically he is similar to ISO27001. SMS specification is not much different. [553. 26-557. 62]. Both of us have passed.

We also passed the last year through 27001. [559. 14-563. 02]. Personal data protection, as we may be exposed to the customer's personal information, such as certain services we do with voice services. It may be necessary to monitor the customer's computer for his security monitoring. [565. 60-573. 28].

[576. 34-579. 68]. So we are also in the position of something besides the technical aspects of things management. [581. 46-583. 26]. This is our service base in Taiwan about the entire support network from Taipei to Kaohsiung in Vietnam. [588. 90-589. 92]. There are about 8 locations.

Overseas China is Ningbo on Suzhou. [595. 86-600. 72] We started in Vietnam because of the construction of the Vietnam steel plant. So we sent a lot of engineers to help build there. [605. 06-610. 70] Later, we had to finish there.

By the way, we also do some other things that can be done there. [611. 98-618. 12]. There is a Depot Center in the United States to provide Depot Service. [618. 90-623. 50]. This is Tang Yankee's Service Network. Please refer to it.

[623. 50-626. 06]. Marketing organizations can be divided into 6 business clusters. These are marketing units. [626. 06-631. 70]. That can be said to be regionally divided. [636. 30-640. 92].

The first business cluster is mainly in Hsinchu and Central Taiwan. The second business cluster is probably in Hsinchu and Central Taiwan and South Taiwan. [640. 92-648. 90]. However, some of the focus solutions are different. [648. 90-653. 00]. For example, the first business cluster has compared their focus in IBM solutions in the past.

The second business cluster is now compared to Sun Micro. But it is not so now. [654. 02-663. 24]. In fact, a lot of things have been mixed. All are based on the customer. Then the sixth business cluster.

[665. 02-669. 38]. The sixth business cluster is probably based in Taipei. Financial insurance telemedicine and public sector. The eighth business cluster is private telecommunications. [672. 96-679. 92]. Telecommunications and television media energy, etc.

[679. 92-683. 26]. He is mainly looking at Chunghwa Telecom's very large. The fifth business cluster is probably based on information security. He was originally a professional service team. I brought him.

[684. 54-690. 02]. Then, due to the continued expansion of this security demand, it was simply transformed into a property center. That is, the main security focus. [690. 02-704. 30]. Then we serve all products in Taiwan.

[705. 26-707. 82]. Well. Next, we're comparing what we're doing. [712. 44-416. 28]. This picture is probably the role of Dunyangke. We help our guests to generate architecture in the middle of this cloud.

[716. 28-720. 62]. We are all mentioned in the various services. In the past, it is possible for our customers or help us to carry out a variety of ICT services together with our customers. [720. 62-737. 32] The so-called big data is probably speaking now.

All of this depends on the AI. [740. 14-751. 40]. It includes a wide range of remote medical factory automations, etc. [751. 40-756. 00]. That is to say, all these services rely on what is delivered to where we have done through the bottom internet. [756. 78-767. 82].

To do or provide our telecommunications company with these cable page-related solutions. Let them be able to use a telecom network or this broadband screen of Cable. [768. 02-780. 38]. Let him provide a data network. This data network can be done with data or speech. [780. 38-784. 72].

That's where they deliver it. Right there are some of these that include business PC families. [784. 72-796. 14]. Then OT etc. In fact, the various compositions of this bunch ultimately rely on business actions to drive these things to happen. [796. 14-808. 58].

So Dunyangke also works with these so-called purchasing sponsors for content providers. To do this better in the middle of these services, you must have this driver. [810. 10-823. 94]. This can enable a variety of services to flourish. [823. 94-826. 52]. Anyone who wants to buy will have to sell.

To sell something is to think about the need to use a variety of areas of people to play Primetuming. [827. 04-840. 90]. Then providing a variety of content may be possible to build up one of so many voices. [840. 90-849. 28] This figure probably means this.

[850. 06-857. 28]. Object division is probably from the middle of the middle of this middleware is that the information infrastructure contains just mentioned data management. [859. 32-871. 14]. Information security system platform and resource management. The resource management of the data management architecture in the system platform is determined to manage him in the end. [873. 92-883. 90].

The system is either busy or he is too busy or he is not at all busy. [883. 90-889. 26] Is it possible for other applications to use it to be related to resource management? We all know that NVIDIA's GPUs are now sold very well. [892. 34-898. 74]

One of the computing power is provided, not all the computing power is on the GPU, but also on the CPU. Our company in addition to the CPU GPU, but also on the virtual machine, which is usually down to the CPU. At the bottom is the network we just mentioned, the network of course to do management, online is a variety of applications. By vertical manufacturing applications include ERP, CRM, SCM, MES, and so on.

What is better than that? Like some of our FPC solutions are all fiber-optic, that kind of fiber-optic thing it doesn't need electricity, and it doesn't have a displacement problem. It only needs one fiber-optic, so all of it can be monitored, whether it is extrusion or pulling or hardening, so this part of us has some input. Also, the financial services industry's AML anti-money laundering, high-frequency trading, etc. The left is our dunyangke, whether from software development, infrastructure development, and project management, to our guests, from the right side of this bunch of professional models to execute.

So the user is the customer we talk about, the opportunity to import, not as in the past, just to make a model is even if you open source like some of the Lama3 open source, the model is hundreds of billions, that is not a general computer can support, are tens of millions of computers can do it. Well, so what are we doing? We provide our guest AI infrastructure, which contains his container docker construction, as well as his data governance, how to manage this data, how to manage his container, how to manage it, so that he can be highly portable from different places, such as you can put at home, the environment at home, the execution environment, or move it to the cloud, there are a lot of clouds, you can migrate to Amazon, to Google, or to other places, so long as we can use Docker such architecture can migrate.

If you want to do something with your existing Inference or Model is the same, you can directly use it and quickly import it. If you can't do it yourself, then AI Foundry and Ivian WatsonX is the same thing. If you can't do it yourself, then AI Foundry and IvianWatsonX are the same thing. That's why we use Open Source and Open Source, and they do it together. That's why we can do it like Open Source and Open Source.

In addition to our sales of AI, our company has already used a lot of overseas tools, and in many areas we have already used AI. We have some loadings like our sourcing, whether it is like our MDR Team, we use AI to automate it, which can reduce the manual, which can make all the tasks performed more efficient.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription fragments, sorting them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that the user does not delete, does not rewrite, does not condensate any original sentences. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained and arranged in the order of timestamps, but it may need to adjust the order of the sentences in order to form a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I will check each timestamp the corresponding sentence to see if there is a clear paragraph separation. For example, the user mentioned "industry cooperation" can be the beginning of a topic, and the next few sentences may start around this topic. Similarly, "information security" and "cloud service" can be the other two main parts. I need to classify these relevant content into their respective paragraphs. Next, I will pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp. For example, [1269. 50-1270. 26] is "industry cooperation", and the next few timestamps may be related to the discussion of industry cooperation until the beginning of another topic.

For example, [1305. 90-1308. 46] began to mention "the second thing I want to focus on is information security," which may mark the beginning of the second topic. Similarly, [1634. 02-1636. 84] mentioned "third", which may mark the beginning of the third topic. In the process, I need to make sure that the sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order, while maintaining logical coherence.

The content needs to be segmented, each sub-theme forms a paragraph, such as the characteristics of a white hat hacker, the configuration of a security device, the penetration testing service, etc. The cloud services section involves the status quo of cloud merchants, the needs of hybrid cloud architecture, and the niche of Dunyangke. These content also requires segmentation to ensure that each sub-theme is clear. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that there are no omissions or misplacements. For example, [1401. 02-1403. 58] The MDR service, the next timestamp continues to discuss the specific content of the MDR until another topic begins.

In addition, users may have repeated or transitioned sentences in certain places, such as "good this is our main three security services," which may mark the end of a paragraph and need to be segmented correctly. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph verbatim, check if all the sentences are correctly categorized, no omissions or errors, and maintain the order and content of the original text. Make sure that each paragraph is logically coherent, with a clear theme, and not any deletion or rewriting of the user's requirements.

We sell a lot of security-related devices and software, which are compatible with these hardware and software, and they provide us or to our customers, and they have some set-up procedures. This is a certain set-up procedure you know, and black hat hackers know, so it's usually not too much to keep them. These white hat hackers are not the way to set up these things.

This is why we set these rules to be different from other people, and the security will be higher than the home. Well, there are about three or three things, the top right is just I mentioned the custom rules, the method is different from others. Like the top left, we do these security devices, including hardware software planning settings, we will help our customers to do a scan for his application before it goes live, we can also help him do penetration testing, and this security collection of his code, we all provide such services.

We are now seeing a lot of attacks here, if you do not install, do not do EDR I talk about this endpoint protection, even if you are not a copy of the endpoint protection system, recently many companies, you know that I am not here to explain, are all blackmail, they all do endpoint protection, but they are not the two main products of Dunyangke sales, one is CrossFrag, one is Pilato XDR Pro, these two are very strong, but many of them are called endpoints, in fact, it is not really blocked, but not useful, this is important.

This is a very important part of the security of security, which I have to say, this is what we provide to our customers, mainly three things, I divide it into three, PS, Network Security and Content Security, so-called internal security, content security contains application and data, this part is the threshold is relatively high, the network security is a more biased infrastructure, such as anti-virus Ah firewall endpoint detection, network detection, cloud detection response, etc. Professional services have just mentioned that contains vulnerability scanning penetration test, etc. This is our main three security services.

In fact, there are probably more than 1500 600 of us. Instabase also has more than 1500. More than 2000. The 2000 services are just customers who have reported TA1 in all areas.

They are all ours, and they are ours, and they are ours, and they are ours, and they are ours, and they are ours, and they are ours, and we are yours, and we are yours.

We have done a lot of government cases with companies at the moment. It seems that the government has the plan for me to do so, so I have nothing to worry about.

Whether he is willing or because of some kind. This demand is driven by, for example, carbon footprint. Carbon footprint is a very large one. The European Union will require that you provide these information about your carbon footprint.

So this is a cloud business. You can do it because you don't need your electricity to save energy. That cloud will say a lot of green electricity. So they can do this in a more detailed way.

Cost. This is the cost to calculate this. I am at home. I put these work loads in my own home. Move to the cloud I can save how much electricity. So if it saves energy.

My carbon footprint can be attributed to the EU. So this is probably the situation. But it is true that there is a need for cloud computing. The more we see, the faster we move is the public sector. OK.

I've been talking about these things for a long time now. It's definitely something that's really going to get bigger and hotter right now. We can see that's what we're saying. Applications we're talking about contain a lot of applications. Sit in front of your desk.

"This is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours, this is yours.

This app performs a lot of things that may be related to the public service. Pastries related. May be related to entertainment. All. That's why. This is what this needs after this office.

Not only does it become more and more children, it echoes the various services just mentioned above in the cloud. How can I deliver.

Watch. Smart watch. Or our self-driving car. Or we can see this surveillance monitoring system. etc. Or this AR game with VR.

They will be delivered through a framework like this. This will take advantage of more and more AI. AI can run up and down. This can be done down. Reasoning.

Here is a reference to AgeRain. Here we are in this radio access network is our telecommunications company. This base station is called a small machine room. It is the closest to the base station.

Put some directly. We talk about this MEC. Multi-access edge computing. It's just some. Some machines can withstand high temperature. Also can withstand low temperature.

That is, it can continue to run this machine in such a bad environment. Give me just the front of this. The endpoint is either a tablet phone or a laptop. Self-driving watch. That monitor system, etc.

These are the signs of the end of the world, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, and the wonders of the times.

For some representative of Dunyangke, this solution. Just as the little boy mentioned it all around the world. The first three, most of them first. The first three in that field, or the first one.

A wide variety of products. We can see this software development tool we will use for AWS. This software solution. Or use it to compare things that are related to this M-CAD and PLM. IBM Turnkey's solution includes its AI. Some of these specific areas.

That's exactly what Lazarus is all about. This is a piece of Defense. It's a great piece of military and defense. It also includes a wide range of Microsoft solutions, including development environments, and so on. I'll take this example first. Of course, it includes security.

Data networks and telecommunications networks. We only have Nokia. Nokia is not the largest telecommunications network in the world.

They are the people of the land, the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land; they are the people of the land.

There are a lot of data lines for Nokia. Good. It's safe to mention a lot of Crossfax. C6 etc. I don't explain it. Good.

I'm sorry. Next, I'm going to do this. I'm going to report to the deputy and report to you about my earnings. Hello everyone, I'm in good hands. Let me report to you my earnings. Here is the balance sheet and we look at the balance sheet as the main increase is the stock.

Our stock. From 41% to 43%, the amount is quite large. This is mainly because of ours. The lot order has become more clear then. More than 95% of the stock is in stock and then we will place the order with our Supplier. Then put it in the stock.

Then we look at the current debt here. From Q4 51% to 59%, the amount is also much more.

Encouragement is passed in February. After the board of directors. Then he will raise up the one responsible for the encouragement is put in the other. The other in the payable will result in the current liabilities.

We have seen the signs of the times, the signs of the times, the signs of the times, and the signs of the times, and the signs of the times.

Maori remains about 25% the same. Finally look at the pre-tax EPS. After tax EPS. The first quarter is. 2. 24 It is a new high in the last few seasons. Take a look at each.

The number above the principal watch. Comparison of quarters. The revenue is 2 billion, which is already more than last year's Q1. 3 billion. That is a little less than last year's Q4 because each year's Q4 is basically our revenue. The highest season.

So, Q1 is a little less. But it's normal. Let's look at the gross profit margin as if it remained around 25%. Let's look at the operating expenses. Operating costs are about 12%.

So our business profit is about. 2 billion 6. Operating profit is 12. 7%. The same is true. It is almost the same in this range. Then look at the net profit after tax.

2003. That is also the new high in recent years, which echoes that EPS is the highest single quarter. The net interest rate after tax is 11.5%. We look at EPS 2.24. The net revenue is 2 billion, the whole year last year was $7.5 billion, and we have 2 billion in the first quarter of this year.

That's right. It's supposed to be better than last year. I hope this year will be a whole year. Revenue is OK. There's growth. And then I just said that it's the highest in a single season because our share capital hasn't changed.

So, this is us, this year, this year, work hard, hope to grow, and then look at this in the hand order in the first quarter of this year.

70.7 76% is expected to be completed this year. It is a travel obligation and then converted into revenue. Then take a look at our other revenue products, and we consulted for repair services, which accounted for 28%. Storage accounts for 20% of network products. Computer software 16% of workstation server servers have 13% of the computer peripherals 4%.

Look at the comparison with all levels. Our consulting repair service has a slight reduction. That's mainly because we have a product. He was a subscription system that we had before.

But we now because. The subscription system has a requirement to put it. The margins are all converted into computer software. So there is a heavy classification. Reclassification leads to the Q1. The consultation repair service has a slight drop.

The increase in storage is mainly due to the fact that some customers have a lot of large pieces. Some big customers are buying storage. Let's look at it again. 19% of that actually remains about 18%19%. The software.

Computer software. 16% at work. Workstations and servers have some increase. 13% increase. Take a look at the values for each product.

The largest growth this year is storage. Then look at the industry. Industry. Electronics-related industries. 46% of the semiconductor industry. 14% of government education.

Telecom industry 12%. Transportation and traditional manufacturing 8% financial insurance 8%. The other 6% of biomedical industry is other industries. Look at the comparison at all levels. Each industry is probably between 1 and 2% so there is no.

Particularly less. Electronics. Electronic-related industries are the same as staying at 40%. That's just how good it is to perform. Then look at the area.

Our local revenue in Taiwan has increased to 98.5%. That's China. The remaining 1% has become. Very few. See next three quarters of revenue. That's the quarter.

In addition to last year's Q. Single-quarter high. Second only to last year's Q. Sales of products accounted for 72% of the labor provided by 28%. Above.

Question. Thank you to Vice President Huang for following the briefing. Next, we will have a Q&A session. Welcome online customers to ask questions directly on the microphone. You can also leave your questions in the chat room with text and questions.

Hi, I'm a researcher at Meta. I'm a researcher at Meta. It's easy to ask. It's convenient for you. Hello, I'm asking about storage.

In the first quarter, we saw strong growth that we could do more. Give us a detailed description of what it is. Customer, or what application it is. This led to an increase in demand. And we expect that the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of this year will not be relevant for continuity. Thank you.

We do not have any tags for The Lord of the Rings lyrics. and the Lord of the Rings lyrics. and the Lord of the Rings lyrics. and the Lord of the Rings lyrics.

He also wants to make extra investments in storage equipment otherwise we've been pretty average in the past as usual. It's not going to happen all of a sudden. These are the reasons for the increase that are more relevant to the new application. Answer you. Thank you. Check again for what we're seeing.

This is the season of the year in which the rest of the quarters can be maintained. We have no way to answer, we have no way to answer, we have no way to answer.

I can see that we are in this industry, in fact, very good, but the part of the telecommunications industry growth is very large. This amount of revenue to talk about this season is what I want to ask, because electronics in the telecommunications industry, 2024 is actually a recession, from about 11 billion to about 8 million. As such, the first quarter of this year is not good, I wonder if he has no continuity, that is the first question, the second question is whether he wants to ask whether capital expenditure or we have a relative correlation.

The second is that I think this external factor is a lot, I think you should be more sensitive in this area of investment. What we see now is that it was supposed to be so far, we heard that with our customers and our business reaction is on the topic of AI is really glowing. The solution we can provide can also be varied, so we also got a lot of cases customers are willing to invest now, because the entry threshold is not so high, you can do a little bit bigger first, compared to the past is completely different. So if we do not see this situation of geopolitics or some bullying this country, it is basically good, especially our industry is really good.

This is the customer relationship between Chunghwa Telecom and their relationship with the industry, which is very good. But I see that the part of the computer software is in fact a few years of growth, the first quarter of the year there is a small decline, so I can expect this is just a heat cup, and this year will continue to grow.

The G-Bone network has been around for a few years, and that is the problem with the continuity of the battery. The more the computer software is relatively small, the more I think it is likely that the company will buy a little more of his other devices will decrease, because it seems to be a bit of an increase in the customer is overlap. So the whole budget may also do some removal, but the computer I would rather ask is that if we can easily talk about the Gross Margin, because we will publish every month will have a lot of profits in our business, especially in our own business interests.

That bad telecom industry like a plan to say that we will reply to a better one this year, for example, a year with more than a billion numbers like this, he will drag to our Gross Margin, is it possible to expect it. Usually telecom this large monopoly his Gross Margin is relatively low, the government units because of the government unit in the first quarter of this year is also in good condition, so this is not possible to say that their comparison is a little different is that Margin is not a good thing.

We usually look at the first quarter of the year, and that is the lowest revenue. I can still use it this year because we are all stable, can I use the past pattern to think about a situation this year? I think not much, because each quarter will determine which cases are really not fixed, he actually finished the case we decided.

The fourth quarter is usually the most likely to change at the end of the year, but there is no fixed pattern that says the first quarter is the lowest, and then there is no such pattern in the second quarter. I understand that, so the fourth quarter is the highest, but it may not be the lowest in the third quarter.

As I see that we just jump to a quarter to increase a lot of people, then we are embarrassed to let others news, but it is our efforts last year, thank you, thank you. Vice President here have a text question in the chat room, and then trouble you. Just a few questions? The opportunity to double-digit growth which industry? This is no way to answer, say which industry will have a double-digit growth 16%, this may ask Yuan yuan, they expect that we are YY 16%, we do not make such a prediction, we want to grow to this goal forward, as long as those external factors do not really give this industry to it, we see very positive.

We have a credit risk risk analysis in our earnings report that if the dollar fell by 1%, we can influence the number of 80,80,000, so it is very small. Income tax rate, income tax is the government's creation, we are not the same thing is the sales cost is the human, that is everyone's salary, that entrepreneurship is still a strict we have to increase, but we also have to increase revenue, so he is actually following the growth of revenue in addition to increase, so I think that you should increase a lot, so I think the business cost is still about 12% or so. AI related revenue this year also accounted for many of our investment friends to ask questions such problems, one is how much you did in consultation security or how much AI did, in fact we have no way to do this investment.

The second question is, if we look at the whole brake down, there is a investor and repair I can ask investors to repair this part of the margin and the average of the company to talk about what the difference is, these two questions, thank you. I answered the second, the investor and repair is of course the margin is higher, it is a more professional service, is a part of my service, but it is not very relevant to the insolation, it is why some of them will be said that the insolation base is higher.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim texts provided in a sentence, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

At the same time, pay attention to the Q&A section in the conversation, such as the discussion about the Quantum safe framework, and the comparison of gross profit margins between different products, which may require segmentation to maintain the consistency of the conversation. In addition, thanks and ending words at the end of the meeting also need to be segmented separately. During the process, I will make sure that the sequence of sentences in each paragraph is consistent with the original, without any adjustments.

In addition, pay attention to the processing of timestamps, users may not need to display timestamps in the final paragraph, so it is necessary to remove these timestamps and keep only the conversation content. Finally, I will read the whole converted paragraph verbatim, check if any sentences are missing, make sure that all the content is correctly classified, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, logically. At the same time, make sure that no additional content or modification of the original intention is performed exactly as the user requests. </div> Since this may have been a long time before, more and more investment friends asked all the companies he would not be able to spend a day or night with the same set of equipment for his lifetime is not enough to change it? He said that he did not change the service he did not believe that he did not continue to work with us is going to fall. So investors and maintenance of this part of Gross Margin can have an idea because it is very high proportion of us, so it is not a good way to answer bad questions.
