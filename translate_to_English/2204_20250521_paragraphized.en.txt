Mr. Chen Jinwu, the Vice President of China Automobile Industry Corporation, attended the presentation of the report on the results of the operation, and then followed the QA time. First of all, please ask the Vice President for a briefing. We will present the results of the operation of Q1 and Q2 in the first quarter of 2025. This year, we will first explain the results of the operation of Q1 and Q2, and will also explain the results of the promotion of ESG in the fourth quarter.

First of all, the Q1 sales performance. The total sales volume of Taiwan's total car market in 2025, and the same period last year compared to the same period last year, showed a relatively significant decline of 11.2%. The total sales volume of domestic cars was 50,000 units, compared to the same period last year, which was 15.5%, which would be a little more noticeable. The part of the company, compared with the first quarter of last year, our multi-brand sales volume response policy, which is a relatively large decrease in national policy, so the number of sales units declined 31.8% compared to the same period last year.

In the first quarter of this year, our newly launched J-Space showed excellent product power and customer feedback, which included a feature of our urban and commercial double-market fees, to achieve this direction of commercial vehicle use, to expand the counterbalance of the new business market. After the listing of a stable growth, the total sales of the total market in April 2025, and the license plate reached 1686, which is the second in the total market. The most important feature of this vehicle is that the whole car is developed by China Automotive autonomous technology, so it is fully mastered in our own hands. The same period is also the only advanced driving assist system with Level 2 in Taiwan's light-duty commercial vehicles, which also reaches more than 60%, but is based on domestic supply chain highly cooperative models.

In 2025, as part of the Q2, we continue to deepen the technological innovation and supply chain resources in Taiwan, and hope to enhance the competitiveness of Taiwan's automobile industry as a whole. That is, we will continue to deepen the technological innovation and the overall capacity of the automobile industry. The first part of this section is to deepen technology capabilities, which we now cooperate with R&D units and suppliers to develop innovative research and development, and strengthen internal talent cultivation to deepen the core technology capabilities.

The last one is about an international exhibition, a purpose of participation in the international exhibition, to improve the visibility of the industry, then you see the company's newly developed ET35 such a shuffle car, hope to participate, in the last quarter has participated in the ET35 international smart mobile exhibition, attracting a lot of attention from many corporate customers, these cars are expected to be marketed this year as well. The newly mentioned new chapter of smart transportation, this part of this part of the Chinese self-driving car and national industry policy integration, we are in fact a well-known domestic industry, including LITERATURE, LIGHT, LIGHT, COFY, and other domestic manufacturers, the key components of the experimental car, which include the photo is the photography system, the radar and the three-in-in-one motor, are our domestic systems.

The ET35 is the first commercial vehicle to be developed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan in 2025. It is expected to be mass-marketed in the third quarter of this year. The highly localized technology is highly localized, and the nationalization rate of the vehicle can reach more than 90%, which includes chassis powertrains and even battery cores and modules.

That goal is to build a national team of electric vehicles. At the same time, in the development of the chassis process. At the same time, in the development of the chassis process. It is also co-developed with the Institute of Mechanical Research.

There are systems that include battery-controlled motors. There are key components such as IOT and fast-charging controllers, which are all part of the country. The above is the Q2 outlook and some of the progress of some of our technology research and development.

It has been announced that the top 5% of the corporate governance assessment we have lived in for the 11th consecutive year. In fact, this assessment started in 2014. The company has achieved the top 5% since the first one. So far, it has not been interrupted at all.

That's all. There are only 7 companies in Taiwan. That's a total of 976 listed companies after the election. Only 49 listed companies with the top 5%. This year, there are 16 new listed companies. The competition is getting more and more intense.

But there are only 7 companies that have been maintaining this success for 11 years in a row. That's what we've been talking about this year, and we're also promoting a future workplace newcomer. That's what we're talking about this year, and we're talking about a future workplace newcomer.

Part of the public welfare. China Motors wants to read the program. It started reading miles. At present, we firmly believe in the power of reading to make a difference. So in line with CommonWealth Magazine Education Foundation. Since 2004, we have donated mobile bookscars.

Join the Hope Reading Program. So far. This time we donated the seventh mobile bookscar. The cumulative miles of these bookscars in Taiwan. It has reached 260,000 km. To Taiwan is equivalent to 242 laps around Taiwan.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the structure and content of each part. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, so the original text must be kept intact.

First of all, I will examine the original transcription by a sentence, paying attention to the timestamps and the corresponding sentences. The user's example, some sentences have obvious logical connections, while others may belong to the same topic. For example, on the gross profit margin section, these sentences discuss the gross profit margin situation of different models, and should be merged into a paragraph. Similarly, on the market outlook of Taiwan, from [1438. 32-1442. 80] to [1486. 74-1491. 92], these sentences can be merged into a paragraph, as they are all discussing the same topic. Next, I need to identify which sentences are the same topic or answer to the same question. For example, on the effects of Taiwan currency appreciation, from [1535.32-1540. 26] to [1603.16.76], these sentences are discussed in the same discussion and should be merged.

Similarly, about the proportion of independent brands, from [1615. 56-1618. 66] to [1634. 54], these sentences can be composed of a paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may be separated due to the interval of timestamp, but the content is continuous. For example, about the portion of Mercedes Fujian, from [1511. 34-1516. 58] to [1529. 28-1531. 20], these sentences, although timestamps have interval, are discussed in the case of the same brand and should be combined.

In addition, some sentences may contain erroneous or coherent content, such as [1559. 66-1561. 44] and [1563. 60-1565. 92], "There is also a section to see our exchange rate appreciation," which may need to be retained as it is, but may need to adjust the punctuation or spaces to improve readability, but the user requests do not change, so it can only remain as it is. In the process of processing, also pay attention to the order of the timestamp is correct to ensure that the logical order of the paragraphs. For example, on the distribution policy, from [1719. 70-1730. 12 to [1758. 12-1774. 80], these sentences should be arranged in chronological order to merge into a paragraph.

At the same time, pay attention to the correct mapping of timestamps to ensure that the position of each sentence is accurate. During the processing process, there may be some difficult to judge sentences, such as [1886. 86-1888. 20] to [1897. 80-1898. 44], these sentences appear to be polite at the end of the meeting, but the content is more confusing and may need to be kept as natural as possible, but as far as possible, the whole paragraphs need to be carefully analyzed in order to ensure that each sentence is correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the original text.

The J Space is a self-developed car, so the gross profit margin is much higher than the MG. There is an advanced look in Taiwan's automobile market, which is very clear in the first quarter, is that the entire car market has lost about one-tenth, one-tenth of the 1%. The future is that 2025 is a whole car market situation, and most of the brands in fact are not too good compared to last year.

This is the impact of advanced to the value of Taiwan Dollar on the operation of the company, it should be said first, the impact of Taiwan Dollar appreciation on the operation of the company, it should be said that the value of Taiwan Dollar appreciation on the company's operation, our company now in principle, because the export part is the U.S. dollar machine price, because the proportion of exports is relatively low, so we do not evaluate the impact, but because in fact, we have more than is the proportion of some of the raw materials purchased overseas, so the value of Taiwan Dollar appreciation for our company, attracted them, that we have to them, and then look at the exchange rate appreciation, and then dances, a little bit, the company also busy, we, we, we, we, the relationship of the RMB because of the global hang, so the composition of the ratio is also higher, so we look at the exchange rate of the exchange rate, the impact of the next year. In fact, at the time of the last corporate briefing, it was mentioned that this year's new car model promotion, in addition to the self-owned brand ET35, we will also have a new car promotion, which part of the Mitsubishi brand, is expected to have a small closover by the end of the year, this model should be this year, the end of this year's time to complete the mass production preparation, the market may be between the end of this year and the beginning of next year, so it will not only have ET35.

If you want to grow or manage, especially need to pay for dodob listing, or the process of the new car or more, more granular, now is even bigger, so take a look, we are good to check again in advance if there is any need to ask again, hope Iyla schedule progress, no matter which one,än our operation, it is 006TV specific, that will be, badass, waiting for you. The meeting today is not here, thank you, good, thank you very much, today is the vice president here is very complete explanation, today we will talk about this paragraph, thank you all, thank you for your participation, thank you.
