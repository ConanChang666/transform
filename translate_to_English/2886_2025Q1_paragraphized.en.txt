Therefore, while the number of homebuyers is 8.4% year-on-year, the quality on quarter performance is a bit flat. If you look at the trend of different lending industries, the current domestic demand for financing is still relatively obvious in the semiconductor industry, green energy and 5G equipment. The overall manufacturing quality on quarter growth rate for the first quarter of this year is 6.4%, and the service industry is 9.5% of the quality on quarter growth rate is more prominent.

In the first quarter of this year, the demand for loans in domestic branches is relatively stable, with annual growth rate of 8% and quality on quarter growth rate of 3%. Quality on quarter growth rate of overseas branches is 1.2%, while OBU's loans in the first quarter of this year is 2.2%. At present, we see the demand for funds from overseas business clients, including some investments in the Philippines, Australia, and Japan, and the demand for continuous expansion in Vietnam.

In the future, as Taiwan's customers continue to promote the global layout, expanding the plant and purchasing equipment and working capital demand, is expected to drive new growth momentum for overall overseas loans. If the growth rate for the first quarter of this year is relatively obvious, YOY growth rate has reached 8.5%, Quality on quarter growth rate has reached 2.1%. The demand for Taiwan loans is mainly due to several factors: the first is because the domestic technology industry is obviously warm; the real estate is because the central bank's credit pipe is actually relatively high growth momentum before September last year; and the basis for the same period last year is low, so there are some advantages, so it is seen that the domestic lending demand for the first quarter of this year is relatively obvious.

The current bank subsidiary is continuing to roll out some of the most competitive deposit projects in the market, and we see that the first quarter of this year has increased by 1.17 percentage points compared to the previous quarter, reaching 46.2%. That if we see the deposit ratio, the bank's deposit ratio is 74. 53%, a significant increase of 3.21 percentage points compared to the previous quarter, which is also superior to the average industry level of 72. 12%. The USD deposit ratio is currently maintained at 39. 24%. The deposit spread, which is mainly due to the changes in the global interest rate environment, we have some good performance, which of course reflects the changes in the global market, we have moderately reduced some of the high yield, but high-risk proportions, hoping to optimize the deposit structure, to maintain a competitive margin.

In the first quarter of the nutrition subsidiary, the financial management business performance was quite good, with total revenue of 13.26 billion yuan, and the six quarters reached a new high, with an increase of 7.37%, which increased by 27.99%. At present, we have seen a good growth in various product lines, which is the first-quarter increase of 97.7%, which is a relatively good product line, and also reflects the bank's positive expansion of the relevant business, optimize the product structure, and deepening the customer relationship at the beginning of the first quarter due to the peak of insurance demand. The trend in the lower-left corner, let's take a look at the first quarter: the net revenue of 2.2.21 billion yuan in the first quarter of the bank's first quarter of the 10.4 billion yuan, which is actually a good increase in the year.

The NPL's volatility is mainly because we are looking at the high profit-making period last year, and we are actively looking at the first portfolio, see some of the potentially risky customers, and have added some withdrawals, which is only reflected in the NPL accounts, but this year's account balance is actually not increased. We see that the current Q&A in the first quarter has dropped significantly to $3.6 billion, compared to the previous quarter's $43.6 billion is a significant decrease.

In the face of the recent increase in tariffs by the Trump administration, the global economic growth will continue. In the face of the recent economic situation in the country, the good employment market supports the consumption of civilians, as well as the development of AI technology to maintain a solid and sustainable investment momentum. In the face of differences, tariff negotiations in the first half of the year will lead to import and export growth, but economic growth will slow down in the second half of the year.

Taiwan's economic growth rate in the first half of the first half, according to the latest economic forecast from the President's Office yesterday.

The following is a re-arranged transcription of the transcription content into paragraph-based transcription: ** About economic growth**. It is expected to reach a high growth of 5.35%, with a growth rate of only 1% in the second half of the year.

In the short term, Trump's policy is still highly unpredictable. So in response to the challenges, Mega Group is heavily indebted to credit risk to avoid over-concentration and strengthen market risk management of valuable documents. **On the exchange rate**. This month's appreciation of U.S. dollars, but since the Group's uninsured business and the assets held by banks have been denominated, the U.S. dollar positions have been evacuated, so the exchange rate fluctuations have a limited impact on the profitability of Mega Group as a whole.

**About business strategy**. In terms of business strategy, Mega Financial Group will take a prudent and robust approach to agriculture and fisheries, BHC, consumer electronics, shipping and small and medium-sized enterprises, and provide assistance to other small and medium-sized enterprises in the supply chain transfer financing. In addition, when it comes to capital planning and expanding business opportunities, Mega Financial Group will continue to take the risk control as its mission, prudently expand A5 and actively protect new business opportunities. **On capital adequacy**.

In addition to the expansion of business opportunities, Mega Group will actively strive for the business opportunities arising from tariff policies, including furnaces, TSMC, M&A, supply chain mobility, AI servers, manufacturing mechanisms, and AI industry investments. **Regarding the policy**. The Company's 113-year incentive policy is formulated after our Board of Directors comprehensively prudent financial performance throughout the Group, encouraging continuity of flowering and stability as well as the operation of cash flows of the Group.

This is why we look at a report of the outbreak of central banks, mainly due to the exchange of foreign exchange trading negotiations and the import of legal entities. Recently, our government has a considerable concern about the issue, so we can see that the exchange rate has been stable recently after an enhanced review of a scrambled action. Short-term NT dollars against the US dollar, or a period of volatility, the medium-to-long-term trend will be the progress of tariff negotiations and the entire international economic situation. **On the central bank interest rate policy** Inflation in Taiwan in the first quarter of 2025, inflation is probably 2.8%, inflation is not slow, mainly due to the rise in the imports, and the effect of the rise in prices.

The Bank of Taiwan (Taiwan) has recently been regulating yellow words with seven potential credit controls launched last year and a two-time increase in preparedness, due to the impact of domestic inflation and U.S. tariffs, which could be slightly reduced by the end of the year by 2025.** Policy on the Fed's policy**. I think that the Fed's FOMC meeting on May 7 has kept the Fed's benchmark rate unchanged three times in a row, and President Bowl acknowledges that tariffs impact has been more than one, but emphasized that there is no need to adjust its monetary policy, and it does not take any measures to degrade the yellowish rate.

This is how I think of the year when the tariff policy under Trump's rule is now full of uncertainty, and companies generally take a conservative and optimistic attitude. This year, we set a target growth rate of 4.6%, which is a domestic bond of 4.62%, but we pay particular attention to SMEs, so the growth rate of SMEs is set to a higher target of 4.83%. The consumption base is 4.76%, and OBU and overseas branches are 4.37%, although we aim to set this, but due to the uncertainty in the face of tariff negotiations and trade competition, the economic growth rate may be reduced, so the estimated growth rate of distribution may be affected.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user request, reorganize the provided verbatim transcripts into paragraph format while ensuring no sentences are deleted. First, I want to read everything provided by the user, understand each timestamp corresponding sentences, and then group these sentences according to semantic and logical relationships. The user emphasizes that the content cannot be deleted or rewritten, so the order and integrity of the original sentence must be maintained. Next, I need to identify the topic of each paragraph, such as the first part of the cooperation mechanism and business opportunity, the second part of the discussion on the relationship and credit, the third part involves investment strategy adjustments, etc.

In addition, note that there are some missing parts of the timestamp, such as 1792. 60-1795. 60, but there is a vacancy between the user request not to be deleted, so all timestamps and corresponding sentences must be retained. It may be necessary to check if there are typographical or format errors, such as "parts of the FVPL" are correct, but according to the user's instructions, the content cannot be modified, so just keep it as it is.

The second aspect is about marketing, as the tariff policy increases the volatility of the stock market. This increases the demand for short-term funds. On the other hand, consumers may also reduce their expenses due to uncertain economic outlook.

In response to economic uncertainty, this year's focus is on risk control and portfolio optimisation, adopting a more prudent messaging strategy. We will strengthen the assessment of industries affected by tariffs, and the Investment Office will also adjust the strategy for equity investments. Our strategy is to prioritize the addition of investment parts to FVOCI. The original investment position, the original part of FVPL, is that we will cut it down.

In addition, we will strengthen the capacity assessment of economists and develop overseas businesses. In particular, with our experience in assisting semiconductor supply chain companies to set up factories in the United States, we will have a thorough grasp of the opportunities for Taiwanese companies to expand their investments in the United States.

This is why we have developed a comprehensive strategy to maintain competitiveness and restore our profitability. We have also set up a comprehensive strategy to maintain competitiveness and restore our profitability in the face of the increasingly frequent and competitive financial markets in Taiwan.

The first quarter of this year's earnings fell mainly due to a one-time income of high-speed rail interest-bearing shareholders at the beginning of last year, and this year did not have this one-time income. In addition, since the global financial market volatility this year, the difficulty in financial operations has increased. In this regard, the profitability has decreased by 17.31 million. In order to strengthen the competitive advantage, we will adjust the slowdown structure to date, focusing on high-growth industries such as TSMC's supply chain, AI40 devices, biomedical and sustainable areas.

At the same time, we will implement a strategy to optimize our deposit structure to improve our national capital costs. Focusing on the slowdown in high yields to increase net profit margins and expand the required fee income of our treasury. We will also adopt the diversification of funds, establish a risk assessment mechanism, diversify our portfolios, and reduce the risk of market fluctuations, so as to reduce our overall profitability and boost the momentum of our business growth.

This year’s funding is expected to grow at around 4%, but I am afraid it will be affected by Trump’s tariff policy. While Taiwan’s acquisition trade in the first quarter of this year has grown by 17.5% over the same period as last year, it may be weakened by US-China trade lightning and geopolitical conflicts that affect domestic business interests. In terms of the funding strategy, we focus on this green finance project and merger-linked business, developing green energy industry letters, enhancing foreign currency and OPU lending, and driving small and medium-sized business loans to optimize the scene of our small and medium-sized enterprises.

In addition, we will also actively increase the number of cases of multiple hazards. As for the joint case, our first quarter of our bank's BookRun ranking is 4th, with a total of 8 cases in size of $9.2 billion. It is also the fourth in MLA, which is 10 and $7.64 billion. That this year's goal is to rise to the top three in the market, and the bank will continue to strive for joint hosting opportunities, especially in cases involving high yields such as renewable energy, energy storage and circular economy.

In addition, we also look at the AI supply chain, project financing, large public works and work-life-threatening cases. In the future, we will systematically collect information about business opportunities, pay attention to the industry trends to improve our market capture. Here, a number of media friends and legal persons have asked, such as how businesses ask about some of the mortgages this year, or some of the business growth rate, forecast value, and how to manage the relevant risks.

Our new mortgage contribution in the first quarter of this year was $967 billion, which was 142.4 billion compared to the same period last year. However, our new credit contribution amount reached 13.68 billion, which grew by $91.3 billion compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that the annual mortgage balance decline will be 6.5%, but the expected growth rate for small credit will be 29.5%.

At the same time, the liquidity of the market funds can lead to a slowdown in demand for housing or a decline in prices, which increases the risk of your budget. To control the risk, our mortgages are also audited based on the trusted five-pin principle, and we value the person's repayment source and his repayment ability.

We have strengthened our pre-finance assessment mechanism. We have also adjusted the conditions of the nuclear loan. And implemented post-finance management. For borrowers with temporary difficulties, we offer a loan restructuring program.

It is also important to strengthen the management of single packages to ensure that our overall risk is controllable. And again, it is a compilation. Several legal persons and media friends mention about the obligation of payment. For example, our media friend Chu Han-lun mentioned that the current changes in the total amount of money raised and the commitment to this year.

That also drives the long-term proportion of goods paid and increases our revenue. That is because of the fact that there are already 15 peers approved for this high-asset business, the 12 have opened up, the overall competitive environment is very intense, but we have a very good performance. As of the end of March 2025, our high-asset customers have reached 1802 million yuan, the size of the managed assets has also reached NT$2,181 billion, an increase of 342 million yuan, an increase of 23% and 21% respectively.

We will continue to provide tailor-made and customized services for high-asset clients, and in line with the policy opening of the Government Asia Asset Management Centre, we will further plan financial products and financing services for many years, then create a differentiated advantage of the market. It is expected that AUM will grow from 5 to 10% this year, and AUM will increase to 225 billion yuan, and the number of customers will increase to 1956, which will ensure that we continue to solidify the market's leading position.

The stock market in March of that year fell 10.15% from the end of last year, which was a rise of 13.18%, which resulted in a loss of an operation of the Bank's overall equity fund, which was $3.3 billion, and a decrease in earnings compared to the same period last year was $13.7 billion. For Epic Swap's operation, the operating profit for the first quarter of this year was $2.73.6 billion, which was a decrease of $1.1 billion in the same period last year.

In the short-term equity funds adopt a conservative response, and a transaction in Swap takes market liquidity as the main consideration, then a timely increase in the amount of longer-term gains. In the investment part of the bond, the combination of floating rate bonds during the reduction process avoids the risk of a rising market interest rate.

At the same time, due to a detection of tariffs, it may lead to a recession or stagnant inflation, and the volatility of fixed-rate bonds that earn capital gains is more cautious and conservative. It is also counterproductive to say whether our business expenses for the first quarter of this year can be further analyzed, what is the view of this year's business expenses.
