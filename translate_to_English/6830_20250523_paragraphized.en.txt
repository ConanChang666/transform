[0. 00-2. 00] Today, we would like to invite you to join us today. [2. 00-5. 00] Today, it is our pleasure to invite a variety of companies from the company. [5. 00-7. 50] Attend a seminar on the company's operations. [7. 50-10. 00] Explains the company's operations.

This is a picture of a live photo. It's a bit blurry. We should be more clear in the advertised items. But you can see the scope of the logo clearly. The left is a lab logo from the blog. This is the UV of ASMO.

Helm A's equipment. At the beginning of this development, the Helm A UV exposure machine is not really good. So they are the instruments that bring the synchronous radiation of the blog to the university. The spectrum of the analog Helm A. Do such exposure to produce the product.

That's a picture of one of them. That sample came to Taiwan. We helped him do an analysis of the entire materialTM. To see how it's composed of the entire structure. This is in our research and development. We've partnered with this light group.

That is to say, to enter the IMX generation in the future. After some of the hardest black materials or some UV groups go up. In fact, the scope of the right still has the bottom gas to do the most complete analysis. We are also created.

We are very confident in our customers, including R&D. We are also working with them. That's what we do. So we have no problem with this technology in the future.

This is what I'm talking about. We're doing the right thing. It's the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do when you're doing the right thing.

The future rate will slowly drop below 10%. Not that it goes down. But because the overall performance will grow. IC fault work is this. There is growth in the months. But the future we are solitude.

There is currently a failure analysis of IC design company. Previously we used to talk about M modeling. Then there is a L-type. L-type is related to AI. These IC design company. He develops products as long as they are related to AI.

There is an online or direct entry to the AI project. His horizontal bar open. This case will be more and more. But the non-AI class is a little flat. Low visibility. Maybe we want him to be able to pick.

But now we see that it is more flat. So let's treat it as flat first. Silicon photons with AI. Just explained. Silicon photons we are.

It is an exclusive development with our customers. It is an exclusive situation at the moment. Silicon photonics do what we do. The first machine we developed for ourselves. It is already done for our customers to test. It is not just a measurement.

That is to say, we have the ability to help our customers with silicon photonic chip. Path or Fail. Fail's silicon photonic chip. We can help find it. What exactly is the optical wave inside the silicon photonic chip.

Before the light screen. Or where the light goes off. Disconnect. We will do the material analysis after finding the breakpoint. So it is a whole set of analysis. Here you can see the FAL MA.

Of course, there are peers who say he can do it too. Well understood. Because the MA project is not difficult. But the problem is that you need to do FAL. Find a location to do it. So it is a whole set of services.

So now I'm here to be exclusive. The area of AI chips is now exclusive. That's where the AI company in the United States is currently in the range. Our annual work is very high. And we are expanding. So silicon photons and AI can be foreseeable.

After September, there should be a lot of growth. It is currently in progress. So we will actively do some expansion at the end of May. It is also a pleasure to see its growth.

Some of the overseas parts have just been mentioned. Our original overseas. Only Nanjing this area. The US increased in May. Shenzhen increased after July 4th. After July 20th, Kawasaki, Japan.

So the field is overseas. All the sums and achievements. We are very happy here. Happy to see it grow.

The future will be a significant ups and downs. That point is also mentioned in August and September this year. This is just the beginning. It is the operation of each operating site. Our material analysis department and the second factory of Zhubei. Currently, we focus on material analysis of the process below 1. 4nm.

In fact, I've just said it. Amami generation. With the name of the customer has become Amami generation. A14 symbol. Operation headquarters is now focused on the area of Xiguang. Zhubei Factory is after entering Taiwan.

You will find a Starbucks on the right. The building on the left is the Zhubei Plant. The whole first floor is our factory. Most of the plant slowly becomes an AI area.

AI Zone. Then we built a new SAC TM Center. That part will put a very high-end TM. This part is called CS Connector.

So we had to start tailoring a factory for this equipment. This site covers more than 600 pings. There is a front and back building. The front building is a house. The back building will put a general cut of the equipment in Dubing. The back building will put a ball difference TMCS Glitter.

Then we can expect to put up to 8 units. If there are some modifications to the front of the building, we can put up to 10 units. The equipment is very expensive. We will buy one to two in about a year.

It will be completed in late 2026 or 2027. This is the answer to the customer. This part of the investment will not be too much, because it is with the customer.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like a report about the company's operating costs, financial situation, and future outlook. The spokesperson discussed the size of the venue, the high operating costs, depreciation issues, seasonal effects, and manpower situations. Next, I needed to reorganize these phrase-based entries into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the order and integrity of each sentence.

For example, a discussion about venue size can constitute a paragraph, followed by a high operating cost, then depreciation and financial data, then manpower, etc. It is important to note that some sentences may be synonymous with syntax or logic, and should be merged into the same paragraph. For example, a portion of the February performance impact may require combining multiple relevant sentences together to maintain context consistency. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that no sentences are missing, even if some sentences look incomplete or duplicated, such as multiple "good" words at the end.

In addition, it is important to note that the speaker may have some repetitive or stuttering in the speech, such as multiple references to "good", which need to be retained during the transition to reflect the actual oral expression. At the same time, to deal with possible typographical or speech recognition errors, such as "paradigm" may refer to the company name and need to confirm the correctness of the content, but the user requests do not modify the content, so keep it as it is. When organizing paragraphs, there may be logical jumps between some sentences, which need to be judged according to the context. For example, the parts of the portfolio and market changes may require separate paragraphs to distinguish between different topics.

At the same time, confirm that there is no addition or modification of the original intention, fully conform to the user's requirements. </think> [paragraph verbatim transcription]: Because it is a small venue, relative to us, compared to just a few venues, this place should be the smallest. I would like to sum up just when you guys have just listened to these, the operating cost of our current paradigm month is already at the top.

We do not have consumables because we do not have consumables, so the equipment investment is depreciation, 5 years depreciation, personnel come in is a salary, all aspects of personnel costs, so it is flat. This current cost is flat conditions, the first quarter due to the factors in February of the Chinese calendar year, February performance is only 1.2, so the total loss in the first month of the Chinese calendar month is only 4 or 5 million, so the total loss in the first quarter is directly lost, so the first quarter of the year is simply February, because the annual price decreases due to the annual price decrease.
