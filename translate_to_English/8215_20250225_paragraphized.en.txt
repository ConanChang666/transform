First of all, I would like to thank you for your participation in Fair Paper and investment in advanced. First of all, I would like to thank you for your participation in Fair Paper and investment in advanced. I am James, and I would like to introduce you to the financial situation of 2024 this year.

First of all, we look at the consolidated water meter. First of all, we look at the situation in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the portion of sales revenue was 19.19 billion yuan, compared to the previous quarter and the third quarter, compared to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, in comparison to the previous quarter, the portion of YY was increased by 29%.

The net profit of 4Q in 2024 was $53 million and the net profit rate was 1%, the QA part was 77% and the YY part was 20%. Finally, we saw the net profit attributed to the parent company was $45 million, the net interest rate was 1%, the QA part increased by 2% and the YY part increased by 32%. The basic per share of 4Q in 2024 was $0.14.

Let's take a look at the state of the whole year in 2024. The net revenue for the whole year in 2024 was $185.89 billion, and the revenue for the whole year in 2023 was 9% growth. Then the gross profit margin was increased by 12%, the gross profit margin was $3.6 billion, the gross profit margin was 18%, and the YY grew by 6%. The net profit was $3.7 billion, the net profit was 2%, and the YY was reduced by 26%.

The net profit attributed to the parent company is $1.9 billion, the net interest rate is 1%, and the YY part is reduced by 52%. Finally, the basic per share fishing was $0.22 for the whole year of 2024. The following briefings are some important data. As with the advanced investment report of the previous quarter, the gross profit rate was in the 3Q of 2024, which, as mentioned in the previous issue of the clubhouse, we mainly benefited from the appreciation of the Japanese yen, and the value of the stored value of the Japanese yen denominated, so the value added in the accounting and avoidance policy and the expression of the accounting policy, will be related to the external policy, because the loss of foreign exchange exchange rate is offset from each other, so we see that the gross profit rate of 20243Q is 22%.

As we can see, in the part of 2024 and 2023, we can see that the gross profit margin is also slightly decreased, but through the increase in medical sales, we have reached 30% of the total medical sales in 2024, which helps alleviate the adverse impact of display material YOY's ASP decline throughout the year. In addition, we see the OPEX spare part, the increase in the proportion of medical products we have just mentioned, the increase in the proportion of sales, to 30%, under this situation will lead to the YoY comparison, there will be a rise in the marketing costs and the preparation of the part. At the same time we look at the future, we continue to develop high-quality products, with the investment in research and development costs, continue to increase, so that the overall OPEX in the part of 23 years is an increase. This is a presentation on our comprehensive water meter.

We are grateful to the Chief Financial Officer James for explaining the results of our operations in the fourth quarter of the year. We are proud to have been awarded the Silver Award in the English Sustainability Report in 2024, the Silver Award in the Ministry of Economic Affairs Energy Benchmark Award in the Silver Award in the Silver Award in the Gold Award in the Chinese Gold Award in the Gold Award in the Chinese Sustainability Report and the U-RATER Deployment Brand Award in the second quarter of the year.

Then we asked Chairman VC to explain the company's future performance outlook. Mr. Jiang, as well as investment advanced platform, I am VC, so I can probably report on the current overall situation. Because, I think everyone knows that the new U.S. government is in charge, that.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcript:. The uncertainty of the current political economy is increasing, and the broader market is not so clear. The relatively bad expectation is that the tariff war will cause a decline in global demand, which is something we are more worried about.

On the other hand, we see that due to the improvement of AI technology, AGE AI purchasing, PC demand, this year 2025 is the fifth wave of the epidemic, so we think that it is possible that in the next two years, there will also be a significant change in the PC, and then there will be a positive impact on the display. So we understand that from the perspective of the technology of the display, the O-RATER of the client greatly expands the capacity, and the outdoor, automotive, these displays are also increasing age, so it may also lead to the needs of the fate of the country.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the Q&A, we will reply to your first question. First of all, the first problem is the company's progress in OLED and the car display, we ask you to answer, you directors, please answer the progress of our company in OLED and the car display, what impact, because the performance of the car products is relatively long, so it will bring revenue growth will be relative to the direction. At present, our customers in the car in addition to the panel factory, we also have to develop here TL1, I hope that revenue will continue to grow, we hope that in 2025, we will continue to grow in the car revenue.

The next question is what we think of the panel process landscape in 2025, and we would like you to answer. In 2025, we saw the whole market recovery from the market demand, although it was a bit challenging, because we saw the whole competition in this price and stock pressure can exist, I think the next key or consumer market outlook with this currency and this supply chain, so we still have to look at the situation of the market demand. So the next question is what is the new application and trend of the display, how to see how the Micro LED, PoReM and AR are closer, and whether the inorganic materials have corresponding products, we would like to answer.

The next question is why the growth percentage of medical YOY and its growth momentum are derived from which products and regional markets, we asked DC to answer. The first point is 2024 compared to 2020 about twice, so the whole product line should have almost all growth, that in the region, we mainly have the U.S. market and Southeast Asia market contribution to us, and here we have to mention that some of our professional medical services have been included for the growth of a lot last year, so I want to talk about the continued growth of medical care. The next point is that we will continue to grow.

The next question is whether China's e-commerce or channel grids will increase the cost of the company's marketing channels and free of charge, in this age of the channel strategy to know why, we asked DC to answer. We went to China e-commerce this part of the consumer market basically, we did not have so much virus or maintain a growth in the Chinese e-commerce market last year, this is basically or not.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user's user-side to the paragraph type. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into consecutive paragraphs while keeping the sequence and content of the original sentences intact. First, I check each entry one by one to determine which sentences belong to the same paragraph. For example, the section on team interest, the cost of e-commerce channels, and the way of operation may belong to the same topic, and should be merged into a paragraph. Similarly, questions about the promotion of contact lenses in different regions, as well as the impact of ESG and tariffs, also need to be sorted into paragraphs separately. It is important to note that some sentences may be separated due to the interval of timestamps, but are actually semantically consecutive. For example, [1095. 22-1097. 02] and [28-1097. 78] may be a continuation of the same sentences that need to be combined.

In addition, some sentences may be structurally incomplete, such as "that" or "so", and need to be judged based on context to adjust the punctuation or connection. During the processing process, I will make sure that the sentences within each paragraph are logically coherent, while not missing any original sentences. For example, in the Taiwan region, from "now in Taiwan" to "continuous growth" may need to be merged into a paragraph, and there may be multiple sentences that need to be connected.

Also, pay attention to the processing of timestamps. User requests do not delete anything, so timestamps need to be retained at the beginning of each sentence, but may not be displayed in the final paragraph verb. However, the user's example timestamps are retained, so it may be necessary to keep the timestamps, but it may be necessary to merge them with the sentences, such as putting the timestamps at the beginning of the sentence, bracketing them with brackets, and then taking the sentences.

At the same time, check that the punctuation symbols are correct, such as periods, commas, and whether the commas are appropriate, to ensure readability. Challenges that may be encountered include handling incomplete sentences or sudden semantic jumps that require reasonable segmentation according to the context, while maintaining the original intention. For example, when encountering a connection phrase such as "that" or "so", it may be necessary to merge the front and back sentences to form a complete semantic unit.
