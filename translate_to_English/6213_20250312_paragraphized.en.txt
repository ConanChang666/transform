**We will participate in the first quarter investment forum held by Yong Yong Jin Securities. **We are glad to invite Ken of the investor relations of United Trade to talk to you about some of the company's development and prospects. **We will give Ken a thank you.

**I just wanted to share some of the results from last year's fourth quarter with you. **Last year's fourth quarter can be seen clearly that our gross profit margin is back. **Of course, this is our Utilization Rate, which is the capacity utilization rate.

**We continue to produce these high-end materials and high-end materials. **The thing is, AI is another important material, AI is another very important material, and there is a very important material is AI. **Of course, we can also see that our product portfolio is constantly improving.

** Compared to our high-end product, this is the infrastructure part and the car electronics in fact, its share of revenue continues to rise. ** However, despite the fact that consumer electronics, whether they are mobile phones or some other PC, they all have a constant demand for materials. ** Don't say that the specification for materials should be improved.

**So in this section, although we say that our product portfolio is going to be high-end, but in fact, in the consumer electronics part of the PC AI PC, the corresponding materials are also going to go from the previous FR4 M2 to M4 M6 side. **So the linkage in this part is also relatively beneficial. **And then the fourth quarter of our operating costs are slightly higher.

**Of course, there are some management fees for probiotics that are slightly more expensive in the fourth quarter than in the previous three quarters. ** So if you want to put an OPEX Ratio, you may have to put an approximate 8% up or down. ** It should not be more than 8%, but I think the 8% will be slightly conservative.

**That is also lower than the first three quarters of the income in the first quarter. **Because in the fourth quarter there are some mainland factories sales tax we have done a one-time charge. **Because we have more physical strength than before, so we have to do a one-time charge.

**We all know whether we're a member or not. **Because we're going to build this factory in Thailand, the next number in the FINAL MODEL may be about 35% more accurate. **The next step is to see our next encouragement.

**We are a relatively small percentage of the interest rate we maintain in this 80% of the current management should be looking to maintain this higher level of interest rate. **Because we also want to put in our R&D and Thailand factory, we also want to give back to investors and shareholders. **This year's outlook is not just about AI but also cars.

**We are still in the process of continuing to grow. **We will be divided into the following countries of the United States and America. **The United States and America are still in the process of writing.

**In fact, our M7 materials have been successfully imported into their system. **This means that if they have new products for this GB200 or later, GB300 is likely to use our M7 level.

We also benefit from the deep-seq relationship here in China. **Deep-seq is, in fact, a relatively cost-effective way to use this medium- and high-end CCL material. ** The server version of the server

And then there are some new projects that are likely to start in March, and then there are those that will be accelerated. One of the things I saw this year, a Growth Rate, we estimate that I will be a little conservative, and I think it will be 10 to 20% of this level. Then it will appear to be gradually stronger, and the first quarter may be a bit weaker, but it will gradually gradually start to strengthen. In the second half of the year, there will be some growth strives, and I may have to share with you later.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank, thank, thank you, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, good good good good good good no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no problems problems problems problems.

The way we layout at the beginning, of course, will still be based on high-end products, whether it is high-end vehicles, HDI-related, or these, AI Server-related, or multi-level versions of this, the server-related products to layout. Then answer the second question, we this year, the direction of each segment of this year, of course, the strongest is still the infrastructure, because like we just said, there is now found, should not say that there is already been a current observed, or AI Server, AI Data Center demand is the biggest.

The smart phone, for United Trade, it actually accounted for less than five percent of the total revenue, so I think it, changeability, may not have much effect on our overall revenue and gross profit margin. Well, thank you, thank you. Graphics card I put it in the consumer electronics, in the past I put it with the PC, such a function, such as PC this accounting for our consumer electronics, this is about 80% of the revenue, that is, the PC related accounting for our overall revenue, about 10%.

I just mentioned the graphics card, it is actually used material from the past M level to M2 and M3, sorry, used to be M and M2, and then now M4 and M6. Because last quarter should be about 70%, this is about half of M4 and M5, this year's first quarter should be about 70%.

Here is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim:. I should not go back to 70%. But we're looking at it all year round. This year should go back to maybe 75% to 80%. I think it should be.

It's time to start contributing to revenue in the second half of the year. But it really has this revenue. My conservative estimation may or may not be confirmed by next year. Because the current production capacity of UMC itself is about a month or more than 45 million monthly productions. So we can still meet the needs of our customers right now.

Last year's capital expenditure was around 1.7 billion. Last year's capital expenditure was about 1.7 billion. This year should be only a little bit, probably between 1.8 billion and 2 billion. You must know that we have announced on Friday that we are going to do the second phase of Thailand.

But the conversion is pretty much the same. The end of last year was 540 million. The end of last year was 540 million. The end of last year was 540 million. I aggressive draw a little. This year will be 580 million.

But if it doesn't expand so fast, it may still be around 550. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. low M6 ratio.

M6 or more. 15 finger tips. Because it's already 20 points in the whole year. 20 heads out.

By the end of the year, it will be more than 30. By the end of the year, the M6 will include more than 30. So I will be closer to 30. This is about 20. By the end of the year, the M6 will be more than 30.

More than 20 will be more than 30 by the end of the year. More than 20 will be more than 30 by the end of the year. Overall, if you are a bad look, 35 to 40, then you are stret is very Ninja. nourishing.

There are two kinds of ASICs: those which are related to the CSV, and those which are related to the ASIC. Of course, we already have two of them. We also have the middle ASIC. In fact, it is either a beauty system or a middle system.

AI or General Server. We all have a certain share in it. We are only few in the future. Especially from China, whether they use their own ASIC or they use NVIDIA's GPU.

We are all in this supply chain, so let's first look at this human supply chain, and then see what kind of supply chain we use M6. In fact, M6 supply chain is M7.

In fact, the M6 supply chain is for M5. The M5 supply chain is for M5. The M5 supply chain is for M5. It is for M5 supply chain.

It is M5's supply chain. It is M5's supply chain. It is M5's supply chain. It is M5's.

Whether or not it's high-speed transmission or not. Whether it's this high-efficiency is related. One thing I've got here is that PTFE is actually related to it. In fact, it's mainly from Rogers in the United States. That's really able to do PTFE in mass production and has this Mass production track record.

So of course there is a Chinese business. It does. Because it bought the Tephlon technique of calendaring as a daily business in 2017. So it can do it is that it is not apologizing to the previous 5G base station, it is a business specifically for this RF Antenna this CCO Supplier. That market I have also heard that it should be in the future in Switch Tray or what optical module and light transfer this material is that they want to switch to PTFE Tephlon.

Because after all, the market as a whole they want to use this CCO Supplier also may still be limited to Rodgers, of course, because the business in which it operates is the manufacturing process of this PTFE. So it may also benefit. So the contribution to the Taiwanese plant may be less. So I want to talk about this AI ratio now.

It is high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength, high-strength,

"I am the Lord of the harvest, and I am the Lord of the harvest; I am the Lord of the harvest, and I am the Lord of the harvest; I am the Lord of the harvest, and I am the Lord of the harvest."

We accounted for 20 percent of our revenue. Then it was only 10 percent down in 2023. I estimate these products inside. I said so. M7 level of material. In 2023, it was probably low single.

Very low single digit. Last year it accounted for about 4 out of 5 percent. M7 almost all of the guests we put in volume. They were all AI related. So if you talk about M7 alone, it's part of AI.

Part of it. All of it. It basically doubles 3 to 4 times. We have M6 M4 on top of AI too. It's just that most of it is still used on traditional servers. Or some high-end cars.

And on top of high-end laptops. That is to say, our revenue share of AI. Basically, it must be more than twice the year-on-year growth. Yes, 988G and 988GL.

The two above, now looking at M7, must also be more than twice the growth, yes, come back to this.

"I know what I mean," he said, "and I know what I mean, and I know what I mean, and I know what I mean, and I know what I mean, and I know what I mean.

First, of course, it is a traditional year. So it is ours. Out of the car. All products are not very good. But over the course of the month, it is for automotive electronics.

or consumer electronics has grown a lot. Then I don't know if it's going to be affected by tariffs. Maybe it's in advance. Or they already have. Ready to start stocking up.

They are the ones who have seen it, and they are the ones who have seen it, and they are the ones who have seen it, and they are the ones who have seen it, and they are the ones who have seen it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it, and they are the ones who have believed in it.

But we do not know that it will not serve. The transition of effect. [1833. 34-1834. 26]. - [1834. 26-1834. 50], - [1834. 50-1835. 36] - [1835. 50-1851. 60] The seventh team. [1851. 60-1855. 06] All of the paragraphs of Limitation have passed. The previous paragraph is now accelerated.

Speed up. The machine is already. The order is also bought. Now it is to speed up to put it. Opposite. The first stage has a front and back.

Before and after. The process is past. Then you can make at least 300,000 copies. The first phase.

I'm going to rate this year. Precautions are possible. May 14 to 16. This is the case. I know that last year I was going to be able to do 15 to 17.

But I'm pretty sure it's because it's the first quarter of the year now, and there's still a lot of uncertainty about it.

The first estimate is likely to be 14 to 16. Gross margin this year. This is a very conservative gross margin range.

Passing in your account. Or Greno Large 22. This bagie. Left and right. I want to make this quantitative.

Very. This. Put it here. We are Hindu. gu. bois graphics card is 5060 and 5090.

We all have. But actually, how many customers are using it. I'm not sure how many customers are using the PCB version. I don't have a business like that. So I'm not sure how much this market share is.

My graphics card is not M4 or M6. I use this. CCL class is not M4 or M6, unless it is really low. I will continue to use M2. That is M4 and M6.

Basically, H20 is already using the M7 level material. So just another investment advanced when asked, I will tell you that M7, we can still grow more and more this year.
