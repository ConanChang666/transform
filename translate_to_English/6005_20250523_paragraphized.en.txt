<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like a verbatim of a company's report that involves parts such as company profile, shareholder structure, business development, financial data, and sustainability.

First, I need to sort all entries in logical order. For example, the company profile section should first introduce the shareholder structure, then set up the time, capital amount, point of business, etc. Next, the investment business, the organization, then the operation profile, the financial data, the outlook and outlook, and the sustainability section. It should be noted that some articles may belong to the same topic and need to be merged into paragraphs. For example, several articles about the shareholder structure (financial and foreign and government shareholdings, individual shareholders, and other legal entities) should be merged into a paragraph.

In addition, some articles may contain data or specific figures that need to be properly presented in paragraphs. For example, financial data for the first quarter of 2025 need to be presented consistently, including total assets, total equity, prior tax experience, etc. During the processing process, pay special attention to the interval between timestamps and make sure that nothing is missing. For example, there is a longer interval between timestamps that may indicate different themes or sub-themes that need to be properly segmented.

For example, there may be multiple entries about market rankings that need to be integrated into a coherent paragraph. In addition, about sustainability components, including SDGS and awards, need to be properly categorized and organized into paragraphs. Finally, to ensure that the structure of the entire document is clear, each major part (e.g. company profile, operational profile, outlook and outlook, sustainability) has a clear title or separator, but the user does not request to add a title, so it may be necessary to distinguish between different sections through natural segmentation. After preliminary finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim text to check if all the original sentences are correctly preserved, without omissions or errors.

The total shareholding of financial and foreign governments accounted for about 35%, about 22% of individual shareholders, and about 4x3 of other legal entities.
