<think> Ok, now I need to process the script of the user and organize it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, can only adjust the punctuation, line change, and paragraph merge, while keeping the original order and meaning.

In addition, it is necessary to fill in appropriate punctuation marks at the end of the sentence using Chinese whole-form punctuation marks. In the same paragraph, you can only change lines by empty lines, each section recommends 3-6 sentences, and the subject to change. First, I will read the whole transcript to understand the content structure. It looks like it is divided into several sections: the initial appeal support, the discussion of financial data, and the introduction of the company's business and product lines.

Part of the financial data involves revenue, gross profit, EPS, cash flow, etc. These can be combined into several paragraphs. The introduction of the Minister of Wang includes company overview, production base, core technology, etc., and segmentation processing is required. During the processing process, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points:

3. **Company introduction section**: The introduction of Wang's minister involved in the company's profile, production base, core technology, etc., need to switch segmentation according to the theme. 4. **Point symbol**: check the end of each sentence, fill the sentence, commas, etc., to ensure that it meets the Chinese standard of punctuation.

Note that the user requests not to delete anything, so it is necessary to keep all duplicate sentences and end each sentence with a period. **Part II: Financial Data**. This part includes revenue increase, gross profit increase, EPS change, cash flow, etc. It is necessary to combine the relevant sentences into natural segments, such as the merger of revenue and gross profit, EPS separate section, cash flow section again segmentation. Note the accuracy of time data and numbers, such as "15.04 billion to 18.3 billion" etc. **Part III: Introduction of Wang's Minister**.

There are many parts of this section that involve company profile, production base, core technology, etc. It needs to be segmented according to the subject matter, such as company history, production base distribution, core technology, etc. Note that the spoken sentences may need to be adjusted to the punctuation point, such as "Hello everyone, I am the constable, I am the constable, I am the constable, I am Wang An. " During the process, there may be some conspicuous expression or sentence structure in the context, need to fill the punctuation point according to the context, but can not change the original intention. For example, "that in this section of the bottom line" can be adjusted to "that is actually in this part of the bottom line," and the sentence at the end of the end of the sentence.

Finally, check that all paragraphs comply with user requirements: do not delete any content, use the marker correctly, and divide the paragraphs into 3-6 sentences. Make sure that there are no missing original sentences, and the format is correct. </think> [0.0 00-29. 98] Please do not like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots.

[240. 00-269. 98] Subscribe, forward, reward support mirror and dot column. [270. 00-271. 74] Increase in revenue.

[271. 74-273. 66] The increase in gross profit. [273. 66-277. 40] That is, in fact, this part of the bottom line. [277. 40-283. 36] A part of the owner of the shareholder side of the parent company. [283. 36-290. 56] was the 15.04 billion increase to 18.3 billion, [290. 56-291. 60] The EPS statement, [291. 60-295. 96] increased from 1.28 to 1.56, from the previous year.

[295. 96-299. 20] There is a certain increase in the amount of cash flow. [301. 12-304. 20] It is this part of the cash flow. [304. 20-309. 60] That is, the whole company looks relatively healthy cash flow here is relatively healthy. [309. 60-312. 96] If we look at the end of the cash, [312. 96-318. 36] It is an increase from 63. 82 billion at the end of the previous year. [318. 36-322. 46]

[322. 46-325. 94] increased to 71. 03, at the end of last year. [325. 94-328. 50] It is actually included in this section of cash. [328. 50-330. 44] We also continue to accumulate. [330. 44-332. 62] Yes, [332. 62-334. 04] Yes. [334. 04-342. 10] I would like to explain here that this year's 2024 operating activity is 46.1.2 billion.

[342. 10-345. 92] The flow inflow was relatively small compared to the previous year. [345. 92-349. 82] The 22-year-old and 23-year-old flow inflows 6.5 billion. [349. 82-353. 78] The main difference is that it should actually be part of the increase in revenue. [353. 78-355. 94] It caused some additional operational increase. [355. 94-359. 26] This is some of the expenses of this cash in the year. [359. 26-361. 82] This should be considered a natural phenomenon.

[361. 82-364. 14] That is the whole point. [364. 14-366. 44] In the current part of the company, [366. 44-370. 02] relative to the first payment has been improved. [370. 02-374. 12] And then the profit has also increased. [374. 12-381. 28] That is, in the last year, from a revenue segment in the near five quarters. [381. 28-384. 86] I would like to say that about 234Q.

[384. 86-385. 90] The fourth quarter of last year's single-quarter revenue was, [385. 94-387. 48. 112 billion, [387. 48-390. 80] It was a slight decrease from the third quarter, [390. 80-395. 16] It was a seasonal factor, [395. 16-400. 02] It was especially important that last year's revenue should be normal. [400. 02-404. 12] The revenue should be high in the third quarter.

[404. 12-408. 46] That last year, it was actually 234 quarters. [408. 46-411. 82] Relatively speaking, the revenue situation was relatively stable. [412. 82-415. 90] The third quarter of this part of the gross profit margin was probably, [415. 94-422. 08] It was probably a position of about 20% of the gross profit margin. [422. 08-426. 94] It was said by the various business units. [426. 94-428. 74] We can see that,

[428. 74-431. 30] [431. 30-432. 58] Revenue ratio, [432. 58-434. 12], [434. 12-437. 70] In 2024, this part of the special material was in the third and fourth quarters, [441. 80-445. 64] accounted for a total of 27% of the company's revenue.

[445. 94-448. 50] relative to the past is, [448. 50-450. 30] the second largest one, [450. 30-452. 60] a revenue unit, in fact. [452. 60-454. 14] was originally an electronic material, [454. 14-456. 94] was about the fourth quarter of the year. [456. 94-461. 30] the special material is actually continuous because of the capacity or in,

[461. 30-467. 44] This part of production capacity and revenue increase, in fact, continued to be some, [467. 44-470. 52] growth is relatively obvious, [470. 52-473. 08] The last year, in three business units, [473. 08-475. 90] If a growth rate is in quantity and amount, [475. 94-479. 78] Special materials are about 10%, [479. 78-482. 60] This is also the one for today.

[482. 60-489. 00] The Minister of the Special Materials Division came to explain to you one of the reasons why it is important. [489. 00-492. 06] I'm the one here, [492. 06-493. 60] The explanation is probably here, [493. 60-495. 40] Please contact us, [495. 40-505. 38] Our Minister of the Special Materials Division. [505. 94-508. 50]

[508. 50-510. 54] I am the secretary of the special materials division of the product. [510. 54-514. 64] I am Wang Wang Wangyu, [514. 64-516. 18] I am Wang Wangyu, [516. 18-517. 20] Yes, [517. 20-519. 26] Next I will introduce, [519. 26] Our special materials love one of the product lines.

[522. 58-524. 38] It is called luminous material. [524. 38-525. 66] The production area executive, [525. 66-528. 22] Yes. [528. 22-533. 84] First of all, I was referring to our company's profile on the domain and then to the luminous material. [533. 84-535. 90] I am not sure what the luminous material is. [535. 90-537. 44] I explained it.

[537. 44-544. 10] Then there is the market trend and its outlook, [544. 10-546. 40] I will briefly introduce our company, [546. 40-547. 94] It contains six directions, [547. 94-549. 22] Company profile, [549. 22-550. 50] Special distinction, [550. 50-552.2] Core technology,

[552. 02-553. 06] Production base, [553. 06-555. 36] Mediation direction to the international, [555. 36-557. 40] I said a bit faster, [557. 40-559. 20] because it is approximate, [559. 20-561. 24] The whole, [561. 24-563. 04] one of the product materials,

[563. 04-556. 32] A large part, [56. 32-565. 86] One direction of the package, [565. 90-568. 98] We only have 1964, [568. 98-572. 56] So last year we had 60 years of family, [572. 56-576. 66] We produced about 25 countries around the world, [576. 66-578. 44] Of course, we still have more.

[578. 44-579. 22] in mainland China, [579. 22-581. 26] in mainland China, about 14, [581. 26-582. 80] us, [582. 80-584. 58] the year of power is about 5000 people, [584. 58-588. 18] the year of 2020 was total 41.2 billion, [588. 18-589. 96] we are compared.

[589. 96-592. 02] Associated with a medium-sized company,. [592. 02-593. 30] So, we are. [593. 30-595. 86] We are not as high as the whole. [595. 90-597. 70] We are the literary industry of the upstream, [597. 70-600. 00] It is the production type, [600. 00-603. 58] We are a research industry in the downstream of our client.

[603. 58-605. 38] So our research and development stock is relatively high, [605. 38-607]

This is why we classified several industries into the numerical plate, then light curing plate, low color inclusion plate, new energy and photoelectric semiconductor can be carried out, just to say that we want to sell the products to use raw materials or products, non-terrestrial mainstream products to do so. In fact, we mainly do the whole material building, then we have a few directions: a life material that has been put into the period, then there are some quick screening, there are some electronic materials focus on the next generation of high-speed machinery, and there are some special light-sensitive materials.

This technology of curing materials is probably 50 years ago from the Swiss West Bagliden name, then it is the light to light and then can make the body into an object process, then it is widely used in so-called aerosol-free materials, printing ink, adhesives, and later applied on the PCB board, is equal to the whole light to do some application of some materials. Therefore, the curing material itself has some performance economic environmental protection and efficient feature, so that we have some early soil changes from liquid to solid you want to dry, then it may need some drying in the oven to the energy pipeline, then such curing material is probably a bottom hood, but also very characteristic.

This is the reason why some traditional container type or relatively high pollution can be turned to light curing people in the coming years will be going to this turn. So suddenly I am not accurate from 2022, because the year of the epidemic I lost the buyer of the whole customer panic period overbooking, so 2022 will fall, but now it seems to continue to grow in the past two years. Now I have three production parts in Kaohsiung, the mature base development zone of the Yangtze River, and Zhuhai Gaolan Island, where my output here is about 120,000 tons, I can also produce light curing drugs about 7000 tons, so sometimes encounter the problem of the US-China movement, we organize out of the land, in this way to solve the problem of the taxpayers.

The first light curing poison itself has its advantages, that is, in some relatively small layout in the investment too much and then forward the industry to rise, usually the recent trend is that light curing poison because it does not require too much investment and its capacity is not too much, for example, a container type poison incubator it may be 25 meters, light curing it may be enough, the whole performance is very much. The second is because it can be energy-saving and environmental protection, and it does not have it in the whole production regulations.



Our customers are the same as the market they want to attack. In fact, we are a special molecule, so now we have a lot of technology in China, so the market of light and shadow power generation is actually looking at it as if it has been the whole end of the line. The competitiveness of our industry is in our technical team, which is to make a differentiated formula for the entire industry we serve. So we say that we are not selling a so-called material, we are selling a solution, and we are doing this to operate our differences.

Can you share with us what we included in the expansion of the route, say we still have the expansion of this route this year, so this expansion will not be cheap? I think it is for the market in negotiations, what is the difference in guiding the product, so according to the two let us see this expansion, what is what?

This is what we do when we are talking to our customers. There are five hints that formula collaboration can be understood as what we do when we are talking to our customers. So we have to do these things, we have to buy outside customers to do a set, not ourselves, we are all doing it ourselves. We use the customer he will open a specification of what he needs, then what kind of follow-up, then a formula performance, and then we use our long-term material to do it for him. For example, for example, light and light generators and add-ons, we will guide him to such things, most of our long-term brands, and we don't have a lot of foreign goods, we have to spend at least half that time.

If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your business, you may be looking for a product that is suitable for your business. If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your business, you may be looking for a product that is suitable for your business. If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your business, you may be looking for a product that is suitable for your business. If you are looking for a product that is suitable for your business, you may want to purchase a product that is suitable for your business.

In fact, some of them have some actual growth. Some of them include new products. Some of them are included. Here is the visit. For this part of high value. In fact, it has some growth in the volume.

There is another part of the area. Except for mainland China. It includes this area outside of mainland China. It also has some of the gains.

In fact, you press margin. It is usually better. There is a product that is competitive and competitive. And then there is this one from Lawn Malaysia. This year we should be.

It is a year of growth in Southeast Asia. The company continues to include it. On the management side or on the product. On all levels. In fact, to Malaysia, there are some extra resources to continue. That is to say, we also announced last year.

In addition to the original synthesis values, we started this year as an electronic material. In Malaysia there will be some investment. In fact, the focus is on the group. In electronic materials.

He is the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, and the One who is the source of all things, the One who is the source of all things, and the One who is the source of all things, and the One who is the source of all things.

A quantity will continue to grow. This year, our function is hope. It is probably possible that we can make a profit or loss in this place. The next step is to invest. This part of the investment will continue. In fact, we will continue to have some.

There will also be some resources. There will be some highlights related to this investment. I also saw the harvest of that other region. In fact, the whole harvest is almost the same. You can learn more about this other region. What other countries have we expanded to?

Or what is the future of this growth. Can it be called? This is the last year to talk about it. It should be here in the North American market. In fact, there should be some increase in the amount.

The processing rate is expected to be around 1 and February this year. It is expected to be close to 70% at 69%. It is expected to catch about 70%. That is, if the total synthesis value is found.

I think it should be about 7 to 6 in 10. It should be slightly lower than average. You can share our three career experiences.

If we look at the company as a whole, because we are generally the target of the working day. It is generally about 10% growth per year. But in reality, the internal is a plan. It is probably the overall should be. About 5 to 6 growth.

It's probably one of those things. It's probably the middle-to-long-term growth rate. This year, if you look at each business unit, because last year's talk, electronic materials should be relatively low.

The growth rate of electronic materials is expected to be about three business segments. The growth rate is likely to be this level. So we ourselves expect that the growth rate of electronic materials should be relatively good. The main component is composed of two parts. The first part is that we have a precision equipment subsidiary.

But it's still in my consolidated report. So this part is going to be in the material. Because this year looks like it's expected to be in the middle or the second half of the year. The equipment on the board should be there. We think there should be a more significant recovery. So it's probably a bit of a downturn for a couple of years.

About a year or two after the epidemic. That is, one condition of overbooking is slowly digesting. It is almost likely that there should be a chance to turn around this year. That is the part of the dry ink of the electric material is also the case. The overall PCB industry should be this year.

One of us has an expectation that the whole industry has an optimistic growth, so in the last year, the two base periods are relatively low this part. We probably think this part, about a growth rate near a number.

In this special part of the word. I think we have just mentioned that king here. It is the Lu people. The Lu people follow the elders. In Suzhou, there is a special note on the capacity of an additional production capacity.

That's the equivalent of saying here. We're probably expecting this to be special here too. This year we'll maintain a relative growth rate above average. That's what I said last year. I'm pretty sure if this part is below average. The main thing is the synthesis number.

That's it, that's it.

The last part is about our capital plan. This year, we have a significant capital expenditure. It should be if the company is here to form a resolution. In fact, there are some external announcements.

But I'm sure I'm going to sum it up in the near future. Recently, the company has a relatively large capital expenditure. Maybe we have a new factory with a synthetic value.

Capital expenditures are expected to have a paragraph this year. The whole of this part of the story should be about three billion dollars. This is actually a detailed figure that you can go back and look at the big message announcement. It is expected that around June, it will start to decrease. It will start to decrease. Because we are currently running again.

There is also a relatively large expenditure. It should be in the part of the Malay factory. The breakthrough line of electronic materials. The current word is in this part of the progress. He should be just passing the EIA in the past two months. So this year should start.

The expected time to move is likely to be difficult at the moment. Probably should be caught. This year is about to start. It may be the second half of next year. He has the opportunity to start the move.

In addition, it is just that the king of the special material business unit here is talking about this new factory of the key material that we entered earlier in the home of the first part of the main. That last year actually started to have a focus on capacity. The other one in Suzhou. The second part of Suzhou. In fact, his second period should be this year. The thousand-year start-up of investment.

This year should end this year. It should be this year, it should be almost the whole plan should not end this year. But this should have been the case in the past that there should be an external card to do so. So now it's all right. And counting.
