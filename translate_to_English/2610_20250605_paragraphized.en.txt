<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the verbatim text can not be deleted, rewritten, or condensed to any original word, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I check the verbatim text provided by the user in a sentence.

For example, the part of the company's operating team should be linked together, while the financial data part needs to be arranged logically. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure the transition between paragraphs naturally. During the process, some non-Chinese content, such as Russian, Spanish, Greek, etc., may be wrongly entered or voice recognition errors. According to the user's request, it is not possible to delete or modify any of these parts, so they must be retained, but they may need to be kept as they are organized without affecting the overall structure.

In addition, you need to pay attention to the correct representation of the numbers and percentages, such as "41.2 billion yuan", "8.5%", etc., to ensure that the format is uniform. At the same time, check if there is too large or too small interval between timestamps, you may need to adjust the separation of paragraphs, but you must strictly follow the original data provided by the user.

I'm an advanced Wuan and I'm glad you're here for the second quarter of China Airlines' corporate briefing. Now I'm going to introduce the company's management team: Mr. Yan Yang, Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen, Mr. Xu, Mr. Weng Yixuan, Mr. Tsai Chunwei Tsai, Mr. Weng Yixuan, Mr. Weng Yixuan, and Mr. Cai Junwei Tsai.

Hello all my friends, here is a briefing for you all today.

Today's briefing is divided into five parts: First, the operating plan for the first quarter of 2025. First, the operating plan for the first quarter of 2025, the operating plan for the first quarter of 2025, and then the industrial environment and market outlook for the second quarter of 2025, and then the operation profile and strategy of the customer's operation, and the last, sustainable as and accounted for. First, the operating period of the first quarter of China Airlines. The combined operating revenue for the first quarter of this year was 527. 7%, and the operating revenue for the first quarter of this year was 5.7%, and the operating revenue for the first quarter of this year increased by 7%, an increase of 4.1.2 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5%.

Net operating profit after deducting operating costs was $5.6 billion, an increase of 46.8% from the same period last year. The final net profit for this period was $6.5 billion, which is $6.6 billion, an increase of 36.7% from the same period last year. The net profit attributable to the parent company was $11.9 billion, an increase of 35.2% from the same period last year.

As the company continues to make profit every year since 2020, the turnover ratio has risen from about 68% of the previous year to 110% in the first quarter of this year. The same ratio of debt has grown from about 79% in the previous year to 71% in the first quarter of this year. So the company's financial ratio has improved and the overall financial situation has been quite stable.

Overall, except for the fact that the oil price dropped by two PPTs from the same period last year, the other cost ratio was the same as the same period last year. The next depreciation accounted for the largest oil cost further. In the first quarter of this year, Singapore's air-fueled Mobstar military price was $90.9 per barrel, down by 10.9% from the same period last year. The total year was 387.1,000 barrels, up by 2.6% from the same period last year.

The blue line below represents the price of Brent crude oil. The lower part of the yellow is the spread of both, and we generally call it Quick. Then we receive OPAP, which is an unexpected increase in production, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on demand. Like Brent crude oil, it has dropped from around $75 per barrel in early April to around $65 per barrel, down to now it's about $65 per barrel, down to now it's about $75 per barrel, and down to now it's about $75 per barrel.

According to the latest report released by the U.S. Federal Reserve EIA on May 6, he predicted that the average price of Brent crude oil this year would be US$66 per barrel and then US$59 per barrel. In addition, he revised this week's average price for aviation fuel to US$86 per barrel, which is much lower than US$99 per barrel last year.

According to the IMF's latest global economic growth forecast released by the IMF, it is equal to the uncertainty of foreign tariffs. The IMF has lowered its global economic growth forecast in April, and the U.S. has the largest downturn. Although due to concerns about the economic issues of tariffs, IMF has revised the global economic growth forecast in the world and countries, but it is difficult to achieve only five global growth forecasts in the next year, but it is difficult to achieve the same forecast as 5 global growth in the next year, with positive 2.8% and positive 3% growth in the next year. And in the Asia-Pacific region, including the ASEAN five countries in China, it has 4% to 6.3% growth in its native seniors.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcript:. The growth in the capacity and volume of global classwork in the first quarter of this year, however, is only a growth in the number of individuals. The increase in class-based rates in the first quarter of this year was slightly higher, mainly reflecting supply chain shortages.

In addition, the number of imports and exports has been lower than before, but the number of shifts has increased by more than 30% in the first half of this year compared to 129 million in the pre-pandemic period. While we mentioned earlier that the growth of the global class movement and the volume of the volume of its capacity and volume of its growth in the Asia-Pacific region has increased by more than 10% in the first quarter of this year, Alara also pointed out that the growth of the aviation market in the ASEAN countries has continued to grow over the past 10 years. For example, Vietnam has grown to 120%, like Thailand and the Philippines has grown by about 40%.

In addition, if we look at the picture on the right, the volume of freight for the first quarter of the year is also the main growth. The volume of freight in the first quarter of this year is actually 13.5% compared to the same period of the pandemic in 2019, and if it is nearly 9% compared to the same period last year, we have summarized the impact of tariffs on China Airlines and its factors, respectively, in four directions.

First of all, it is the part of the class that is less immediate on duty, but the global trade war is likely to cause long-term economic slowdowns in demand for travel. The company continues to monitor changes in general development and positioning, and the province assesses the use of transport arrangements and the potential risks.

In the future, the company will continue to strengthen the control mechanism of financial risk. Finally, the company will see the machine and the sales side, the expected tariff transfer will lead to the increase in the cost of purchasing and shipping goods. The company will set a long-term strengthening of inventory management and strengthen cooperation with suppliers to improve the overall supply chain resilience. Next, the company's ammunition plan, because of the outbreak caused supply chain shortage aircraft deferred, the company has more than 359 and three 321 aircraft, and the company has extended the lease to 773307738.

As of the end of May, the company has a total of 68 passenger aircraft, with 18 freighters, and a total of 86 86 aircraft. According to the current planning of the future, the addition of 11 311 NEO and 24 787-9, along with 10 350-1000 aircraft 77-9 light bodies. A total of 55 passenger aircraft.

In addition, four additional 777-RFs will be introduced, which will continue and further enhance the overall performance of the company's passenger aircraft. Next, the passenger cargo operation profile and strategy will be seen. First, the performance of passenger cargo operations in the first quarter of this year was 2.7 billion yuan, compared to the same period last year, and the passenger traffic rate of 0.22 PVTs. However, compared with the previous 2019, revenue not only increased by 16%, but also increased by 24.5%.

This year, we organized the trend with last month's customers receiving and carrying passengers in January because of the winter holiday peak season and the Chinese New Year holiday, which led to strong passenger performance. Like January's single-month customer acquisition exceeded $101 billion to slow demand in March, but the overall first quarter of this year was able to maintain the level of 2024. Next, Wall Street continued to promote the official website sales channel like the first quarter of this year's official website sales channel is nearly four percent, if compared with last year, has grown nearly two PPT official website sales share of continued growth. The company will not only launch the Chinese New Year flower season, but also launched a number of promotional offers such as students can also provide additional free shipping baggage, such as Tokyo's official website sales channel, such as the Tokyo's official website sales channel is the London Sydney volcano and other marathons direct flight tickets.

As mentioned in the previous briefing, the transition to Taiwan's authentic Peach machine was a continuous growth, so the company will be able to optimize the transition to North America with the introduction of the new economy, followed by the introduction of the new layout in response to the tariff policy in the Asia Pacific public transport chain, and through the acquisition of power from existing North American airlines or the creation of new aggregation power lines invested by Taiwanese merchants. The next page of the route is the operation strategy of the passenger. First to see solid development and household registration, part of China Airlines has recently partnered with the U.S. Southwest Airlines to create a connection to Vietnam.

In the first quarter of this year's cargo operation revenue reached 156 billion yuan, not only increased by 27.6%, but also by 55.2% compared to the previous year. In the first quarter of this year's cargo operation revenue reached 27.6%, compared with the previous year's previous year's growth. In the second quarter of this year's cargo collection, the largest region is 65% in North America, followed by 11% in Southeast Asia and 10% in Europe.

In addition to increasing the number of flights to Southeast Asia, Huaan will also adjust the number of flights to Hong Kong to the United States. In addition to the number of flights to the United States, it will also adjust the flight resources to the 100-day Southeast Asia, and even April, and switch to Europe to reduce the risk. After May, there will still be additional flights of regional freighter to stabilize the overall cargo collection. Finally, let us introduce you to Huaan company's sustainability and performance, first to see the part of the environmental protection, Huaan became not only Taiwan's first through the SBTI airline, but also because of the flight challenge of SkyTeam for three years, in addition to supporting ecological conservation and zero cold pressure, Huaan has been running for 15 years since 2011, Huaan spares its environmental protection efforts. This is today's briefing, and then into the QA time, because we have gathered some investment advanced questions before the meeting, and then the management team first to answer these questions, I am here to explain the first part of the question is to ask about the plane's progress this year, our overall fleet replacement, and whether there is a benefit to the relief program this year, I first to explain the progress of the plane, is this year's transfer, in addition to the carrier, and our wide plane 787-9 aircraft, indeed, our plane is affected by the supply chain, some delays, but this is not China Airlines's only problem, is that all airlines should face the whole industry problem, this is our way to take the initiative, we are to explain that we are the way we are the construction, we will always have to send the building personnel to the station, which was sent to two, this time, this is directly sent to seven, the purpose is that we hope to speed up all the problem of all of all of the plane to deal with us, and that this year's. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

We look at this ticket price from an optimistic perspective. That's the part of the ticket price above. Well, we're asking about the impact of this appreciation on profit. In principle, if we look at it from this perspective, the company currently denominated in US dollars is greater than the overall operating income.

So let's assume that other factors don't change. The appreciation of the dollar really has a significant impact on the company's profitability. That's what we're asking about this company. In other words, cost. In principle, because there are some fuel costs that are priced like the US dollar, there are machine costs.

That's like the strength of a dollar, which really stimulates the desire of the whole nation to go abroad. So we think that positive dollar appreciation is just positive for our company. Thank you. Here's the question we've received before. Let's take a look at this question from this company.

Now let's take a look at this question from our company. We don't know if you have any further questions. If you don't have any further questions, we're here to help.

Thank you all for your participation. thank you.
