I am the general manager of Yulong Motors, Mr. Xu Guoxin, and thank you for your invitation to this Fubon Securities, for giving me the opportunity to meet with you online. This law should be the first time this year, and it was the first time I met with you after I took over the general manager of Yulong Motors in August last year. In the past period, this period of time, 8 months, I was also combing some of the things related to our entire Yulong Motors business. I myself have also been involved in the business department of Yulong, in this channel management, distribution channel management, and many jobs in the customer service department and quality assurance department, so of Yulong Motors is no stranger to the operation of the Yulong Motors.

I will continue to use some time to report on the results of the entire operation of the last year, which I would like to report to you. I would like to retain some time for the QA, then I would like to present to you the explanation. Thank you, General Manager. We would like to see today's report, first of all, we would like to see the sales and outlook of Taiwan's automobile market, which looks at the total sales volume of the automotive market from January to February this year.

This year, we will continue to promote the sales of existing vehicles, and will actively plan for new car listing plans, so we estimate that the annual Taiwan automobile market sales volume is 46.2 million vehicles, compared to the same period last year estimated a growth of about 9 percent. Next, we will see the situation of the China auto market, as of February this year, the total sales volume of China auto market is about 455.2 million vehicles, which is 39.8 million vehicles, and the EU has officially imposed on China electric vehicles in the last year, maintain a five-year return tax on the global economic situation and currency, as well as a change in tariff policy, there is still a change in China export market, and China has extended the new policy, and updated the standard of subsidies to stimulate the growth of domestic sales market, so we now get information, is estimated that this year, the sales volume is about 32.9 million vehicles, compared to 20.7%. 09 billion, mainly the amount of the combined interest and expenditure is increased about 208.1.6 billion yuan, while the net cash of investment activities is reduced by 27.8.2 billion yuan, mainly fixed assets are net increased by 24.8 billion yuan, then the net cash of the third investment activity is reduced by 196.2.8 billion yuan, mainly the short-term net cash is reduced by 296.2.8 billion yuan, and the short-term bills are also reduced by about 143.4.8 billion yuan.

We can see if TAC-free, because the cash flow of TAC-free is borrowed for revenue, and the use of the money-free revenue, so we usually list the TAC-free cash flow of TAC-free, that is, the cash flow of the combined business activities and the cash flow of the investment activities, is about 5.3 billion, the contrast of the cash flow, compared to the 2023 year, which is a situation of TAC-free.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's transcription and sort it into paragraph transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the transcription fragment provided by the user one by one, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

If there are errors in the recording, it must be retained; if there is an error in the input, it may be necessary to contact the user to confirm, but according to the user's instructions, it can only be retained. Then, I need to reorganize the contents of these sentences according to the logic and context to the paragraph. For example, on the part of dividend distribution, the user mentions whether the dividend distribution ratio of the future is likely to increase, followed by the company's current dividend policy, and the average ratio of the past years.

During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the timeframe of each sentence corresponds correctly. At the same time, the user mentioned the phrase "persistent verb" may mean that each timestamp corresponds to a separate sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the independence of the sentence at the time of finishing, but the paragraphs are smooth with appropriate terms or punctuation. In addition, the user's example has some duplicate or redundant content, such as the financial situation and corporate governance of "Yulong Motor" repeatedly mentioned, which requires reasonable segmentation to avoid duplicates. At the same time, attention to the oral expressions such as "U", "Oh", etc., these may need to be properly handled in formal paragraphs, but cannot be deleted or modified according to user requirements, so must be retained. Finally, I will read the whole paragraph-complete passage-perated verb-per-per-pered text, check whether all the original sentences are contained, check whether all the original statements are correctly, without omissions or error, and ensure that the transition between paragraphs, and ensure that the transition between paragraphs are logically.

The following is the compiled paragraph verbatim transcription (totally retain all the original content and adjust only the punctuation and paragraph structure): [Distribution Policy] [638. 32-642. 58] mentions the ratio of future dividends. [642. 58-645. 66] may increase. [645. 66-648. 74] That basically our dividends di hoje. [648. 74-650. 62] I'm still very refreshing. [650. 62-651. 30] I like our shares.

[651. 30-652. 58] I like to reflect on resistance to changing. [652. 58-655. 30] The issuance policy is consistent. [655. 30-658. 12] It has been in the past few years. [658. 12-662. 16] It has been maintained about 30 to 50. [662. 16-666. 66] That 30 to 50 is basically ours. [666. 66-669. 38] It is considered a relatively stable.

[669. 38-672. 52] A percentage that encourages distribution. [672. 52-676. 40] The average of those last five years is about 35. [676. 40-681. 24] If we operate in the future, the physical condition will be better. [681. 24-683. 02-688. 14] We will make adjustments between 30 and 50. [688. 14-693. 18] This is a response to encourage distribution of this part.

OEM quantity and estimate] [693. 18-702. 10] On that side there is mention of OEM quantity and estimate. [702. 10-704. 82] On this part of the OEM. [704. 82-710. 96] basically we are based on the customer's needs. [710. 96-711. 22] On the basis of the adjustments made. [711. 22-712. 84] The current subject of our OEM is Yulong Nissan.

[719. 00-721. 38] There is also this red advance. [721. 38-724. 06] The two are the Lord. [724. 06-728. 86] Of course, they will follow the plan of their year. [728. 86-732. 12] Relevant adjustments and estimates will be made. [732. 12-737. 72] If we look at the current situation. [738. 30-741. 18] This whole production of our foundry.

[741. 18-747. 74] [747. 74-752. 00] There are a number of relatively large variables. [752. 00-758. 84] is the time before and after the introduction of the new model. [758. 84-761. 50] It may affect the quantity. [761. 50-763. 08] This is the part. [763. 08-769. 96] We will reply and report to you monthly or quarterly.

[771. 18-773. 54] The outlook for the second year. [777. 74-780. 86] The outlook for the future of business. [780. 86-786. 34] I took a little time to report to you. [786. 34-793. 24] Yulong Motors has experienced this in the past.

[800. 48-800. 90] This vision. [801. 18-803. 30] This cooperation. [803. 30-807. 38] basically has a certain degree of frustration. [807. 38-817. 02] This thing has been completely handled in the last few years. [817. 02-822. 62] The body of the Yulong automobile is very healthy. [822. 62-827. 46] We can come from several parts.

[827. 46-830. 58] According to the financial structure of our current Yulong Motors. [830. 58-830. 96] is more advanced. [831. 18-832. 30] is more robust. [832. 30-834. 94] The credit equality. [834. 94-838. 38] is also gradually improved. [838. 38-839. 86] The other.

[839. 86-843. 30] We are the ratio of the debt of the individual. [843.3 30-846. 36] In fact, it is declining year-on-year. [846. 36-848. 36] If we look at our data. [848. 36-854. 10] The ratio of the debt of our individual last year has fallen below about 30. [854. 10-856. 08] About 26. [8564. 08-860. 70] So our body is healthy.

[860. 70-861. 02] Also, [861. 02-865. 18] is our free cash flow in recent years. [865. 18-866. 94] is more positive. [866. 94-872. 74] The flow ratio is almost 120% or more at 100. [872. 74-875. 34] So we think this part. [875. 34-878. 58] We think our financial structure is OK.

[878. 58-880. 62] is very sound. [880. 62-881. 66] That is the other. [881. 66-884. 14] I just reported to you. [884. 14-888. 10] We are on the corporate governance level. [888. 10-890. 98] We have been on the corporate governance for many consecutive years. [891. 02-889. 22] This is more than 5% of the top of the listed company.

[895. 22-897. 42] The erotic list of [897. 42-900. 94] is in the list. [900. 94-906. 14] The erotic level of our company's corporate governance is shown. [906. 14-908. 70] The erotic level of [908. 70-911. 78] Further ah. [911. 78-911. 18] If the erotic development is on the horizon.

[915. 18-921. 00] I think that the future of Yulong Motors is more robust in development. [921. 02-924. 34] Everyone knows that affects us Yulong Motors. [924. 34-927. 42] is a major profit structure. [927. 42-929. 78] There are several factors. [929. 78-932. 54] The first one is Honghua Advanced. [932. 54-934. 14] That Honghua Advanced.

[934. 14-937. 46] You can see it too. [937. 46-940. 34] uh. [940. 34-941. 58] Honghua advanced. [941. 58-945. 10] The current revenue is increasing every year. [945. 10-949. 94] It is also introducing new models every year. [949. 94-950. 54]

[951. 02-955. 12] He is heading in the right direction. [955. 12-956. 66] is moving forward. [956. 66-958. 50] is Yulong Nissan. [958. 50-963. 22] Yulong Nissan is mainly part of the industry's acknowledgement revenue. [963. 22-965. 86] It is now more stable. [965. 86-969. 74] So it is the effect on Yulong Motors.

[969. 74-974. 06] In fact, the future is relatively smoother. [974. 06-978. 42] The second is the profit of the new safety hazard. [978. 42-979. 70] In fact, [979. 70-980. 98] Every year, more and more increase. [980. 98-985. 08] This is also very advantageous for us. [985. 08-987. 12] Yulong Corporation.

[987. 12-989. 42] Just mentioned the TAC part. [989. 42-993. 52] The TAC part was actually encountered in the past. [993. 52-996. 86] Especially for the part of sales. [996. 86-1000. 94] That is above the proportion of bad assets. [1000. 94-1003. 00] In fact, it is much more now. [1003. 00-1005. 82] The TAC part is very well controlled.

[1005. 82-1006. 84] Yes. [1006. 84-1010. 16] In addition to his balance of assets. [1010. 16-1010. 94] It is now. [1010. 98-1014. 30] It is also now in the fall. [1014. 30-1017. 38] So it is WRONG. [1017. 38-1020] The entire financing is above.

[1020. 20-1024. 30] Especially in addition to the field of corporate finance. [1024. 30-1026. 34] For this. [1026. 34-1029. 42] Yulonga, the company's future recognition. [1029. 42-1030. 94] We think. [1030. 94-1032. 22] Or else. [1032. 22-1034. 02] A very good.

[1034. 02-1036. 58] A development of er. [1036. 58-1038. 38] Another. [1038. 38-1040. 16] er. [1040. 16-1040. 94] er. [1040. 98-1042. 26] In this part of the business. [1042. 26-1045. 08] You may be more concerned.

[1045. 08-1048. 14] The sales of Uyu Long Nissan are at [1048. 14-1049. 18] Decreased. [1049. 18-1051. 98] That was also affected by this Trump. [1051. 98-1053. 78] This kind of duty, etc. [1053. 78-1055. 58] Some of the effects of this class. [1055. 58-1056. 60] That may be.

[1056. 60-1059. 66] Everyone will have a certain degree of worry. [1059. 66-1061. 20] But. [1061. 20-1063. 26] lie. [1063. 26-1065. 04] Come to China. [1065. 04-1066. 84] Yulong Automobile. [1066. 84-1068. 12] basically.

[1068. 12-1069. 90] Our domestic factory is the most tender factory. [1069. 90-1070. 94] The most tender factory. [1070. 98-1072. 00] That is sure. [1072. 00-1073. 02-1074. 82] The factory is manufactured uh. [1074. 82-1079. 18] It is especially under this wave of future electric vehicles.

[1079. 18-1088. 96] That Yulong automobile is. [1080. 96-1085. 32] The most qualified production factory for this production. [1085. 32-1086. 34] [1086. 34-1088. 64] uh I believe Yulong automobile. [1]
