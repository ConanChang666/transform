Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

As the only invited biotech company to take part in the Computex event, I would like to introduce to you what we are doing here. And why we are a company that is worthy of attention and investment. Take a look ahead at the part of this statement.

About 4 billion US dollars, but today it seems like we can't count up. The number of employees is 49 in total in New Taipei City. Our flagship product is CBL514, which is used for local lipid reduction. In the company was established for 6 years, in 2018, it was used for local lipid reduction. It was the first time in Australia to enter the human clinical trial in 6 years, or in 2018, when the company was set up.

In the past 5 years, we have completed a total of 5 partial lipid reductions. One acne root disease and the second phase of the clinical trial to improve our skin. It can be said that Kangpu has today's market value because we have a lot of positive and excellent clinical indications.

We have entered the Taiwan Medium 100 Index. That was included in the MSCI in February this year. The global small and medium-sized global index is in the top of the index. Another thing worth mentioning is that we just mentioned last year's IPO.

The financial situation has progressed very well. And our funds are also very generous. Enough to support the next phase of our development of a local deficiencies, as well as a number of other indications.

Mr. Hui has been in the biotech industry for over 30 years. Our CEO and chief R&D officer is the inventor of our new drug. He has over 25 years of experience in new drug development and clinical regulations.

We also have a strong team of doctors. Our team of physicians are very representative and authoritative doctors in the field of medical aesthetics. That includes the PI of our clinical trials with Australia in the United States. Dr. Gold and Dr. Goodman are very interesting to meet their best name. Our company is a new drug company. The company's vision from the beginning is to develop new drugs.

But it is a new drug to focus on the field of medical beauty. The new drug in the field of medical beauty is compared to the disease market. It has one advantage is that the new drug in the field of medical beauty has the characteristics of repeated consumption. That is because it is a self-funded market, so it is usually a higher gross profit.

As an example, the best way to sell new drugs in the medical beauty market is Botox. Everyone has heard of Botox. It was the first time that it was approved for the indications, in fact, it was actually a vicious sight. There are also eyelids, soft nerve-related diseases. Then it did this wrinkle, head-up, appointment, etc. in the field of medical beauty.

You can tell your doctor that I'm going to get a needle of a weaker bacterium. Even it can make a thin face. So these are the characteristics of the so-called expansional indications commonly used in new medicine. At the same time, the new medicine will face many different challenges than the general disease medication.

It is the history of the medicine that is approved for the new medicinal drug, and it is the indication that it is intended to improve the appearance. How it is measured. Appearance is really necessary. Ah. According to a so-called scale developed in accordance with the FDA requirements. This scale requires rigorous design development.

The process of clinical development and effectiveness. In short, it is when you want different doctors to rate different people. According to this scale it is necessary to come up with similar results. These challenges are actually in the process of compiling so many clinical trials. We have overcome them all. Therefore, we have established the so-called entry barrier and our competitive advantage.

The other pharmaceutical companies want to enter the threshold. Other pharmaceutical companies want to enter the field of medicine if they want to. In fact, we will fall behind for years. Good. The part of the global patent layout. Our new drug just mentions that our inventors are our CEO.

Like all new drug companies all over the world. We apply for this patent layer protection by applying for this product composition combination. For purposes such as using it, etc. At the present time, we can make CBL514 the world's major.

The stage can be at least 2045. Next, let's talk about our current flagship product, CBL514. Here we list the main indications for CBL514. Contains this reduction of subcutaneous fat in the abdomen.

In addition to this improvement of obesity is to send MD to the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. The other three other indications we added. A total of 11 clinical trials have been carried out. The number of recipients is more than 500. In this case, we can see where the difference between 514 and 514D is.

Because of acne root disease, it belongs to. A rare disease market. In the future, it will be indicative of this field of medicine and beauty. Because of the pricing of the drug sales channel. Even the insurance coverage is quite different. So when we commercialize it.

We split into two product lines. The first is the Disease. CBL514 is not just the first part-time medicine in the world to challenge a wide range of parts. At the same time treat action tests in the field of rare diseases.

Currently, the total number of recipients is 500. The local and part-time 514 drug population. No one has a serious adverse event. So the safety is very high. All completed Phase 2 clinical trials. All major efficacy indicators reached the target.

For the effect, we will focus on the part-time part-time part-time and there is a more formal certificate. 95% of the subjects have been improved. Therefore, with the support of such a solid clinical data, we enter the Phase III clinical trial. **Please note:** Because the text length is too long, please supplement the full content yourself. **

The following is a re-examination of the paragraph type verbatim transcription:. With a high degree of confidence and certainty. Let's talk about the progress of our product line and the current development. That's because of the time, we'll focus on this project to reduce subcutaneous fat in the subcutaneous abdomen.

The FDA also agreed that we would use this indication to reduce the subcutaneous fat in the abdomen as an indication to enter the third stage. In addition, we will also introduce a more formal indication. There are three other ways to send an IND with the abdomen and use the abdomen to improve the fat in the abdomen at the end of the year. The other parts, because of the time relationship, we don't talk about it first. Well, we're going to go into this non-surgical partial fat reduction to improve the subcutaneous fat in the abdomen.

Skinny needles are for those who are obese. They are used to suppress appetite to get you to eat less, and then to reduce the central effect. But CB5514, we just lose the fat that you put on the area. In other words, skinny needles make you lean down, which may be a muscle astringent with some fat. But 5514 decreases only fat. In the United States, nearly 40 percent of people are BMI over 30.

These people are the target groups of thinning needles. And the BMI is less than 30 and greater than 18.5, which is the subject group of our CBL514. That is, after the release of 514, the target customer may have two categories.

So, we can say that the fat of obese people is not very much, but many people are not necessarily overweight. So theoretically, the demand for fat reduction market is very likely to be greater than the so-called weight loss market. Well, let's take a look at what options are available in this local fat reduction market.

At present, liposuction surgery is also the world's most beautiful medical procedure, the sales value and weight are also the number one. He is bigger than the dragon milk double eyelid. The effect of the operation is good, and we can see it in this paper. An abdominal liposuction surgery, his average subcutaneous fat reduction is about 183cc.

It is important not to say that you have a certain risk of anaesthesia itself. In the case of a medical device, such as freezing and fat reduction, the most terrible part of his side effect is that there will be at least one person who is lying on a bed, this abnormal fat gain. Then this may be the result of fat reduction.

For example, Kabela, Kabela was the first medicinal drug that was approved by the FDA in 2015 to improve the accumulation of double chin fat. After the drug was approved, it was even acquired immediately, with a $2 billion worth of valuations being acquired. But since the drug was launched, it was not sold because the weight was too heavy. The load was terrible, and probably 4% of the nerve damage.

This also limits the development of the so-called overall fat reduction market. Our CB9514 is designed to address the shortcomings of the current fat reduction options, such as the just mentioned fat-reducing a lipid-reducing needle frozen agrochemicals, etc. These are all from the outside to destroy the cell.

This is the 514 bastion. 514 is actually a bastion of DYRK1B, the orange part on the left, it is a bastion of cells to survive, it is a cytoenzyme. After suppressing it, it will trigger a series of reactions, including the BX above, it is a bastion protein, the next BCL2, it is an anti-depressant protein. When this ratio rises, it will then activate the activation of the cell-depressant protein enzyme, which is Casp9 and 3. This will cause our fat cells to enter into a program called apoptosis cell depletion.

This is why it is a lot of inflammatory reactions. So, 514 is to release a signal that fat cells are going to kill themselves, allowing them to enter the so-called cell procrastination program to achieve the purpose of removing fat, which is a relatively mild and effective way. How can we prove it is mild and effective? This page shows that the orange part of our current clinical trial is 514, which covers three indications, which include 520 subjects.

Among the 514 drug groups, up to 317 of these clinical trials were conducted in Canada, United States. So all the main efficacy indicators reached the target, that is, the so-called clinical statistical significance, known as the small P, reached 0.05. In that area, we made a total of five two clinical trials, three of which were compared with placebo, 0202 0204 and 0205.

In fact, today as the only living company to come to this computers factory, I would like to share with you a little scoop on the development of the heart medicine. Human trials are divided into three phases. The first phase is to assess the safety of the heart medicine, and the second phase is to further confirm the safety of the second phase is to make a preliminary test, which is to find the most amount of the drug, we call Dose Finding.

How to evaluate the effectiveness? First, it is necessary to define the efficacy indicator, which is called end point. As long as you make the data, the statistical significance of this efficacy indicator is achieved, we are effective. The three most important...

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text snippets provided by the user and convert them into paragraph-based text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence-by-word manner and adjust the format of the original step-by-step format to a more coherent paragraph format.

First of all, I read through the whole transcription to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses the design, results, and the application of related drugs (such as 514 and GLP-1). Next, I need to identify which sentences can be combined into paragraphs while keeping the original intention intact. For example, continuous explanatory sentences can be combined, while the sections of different topics need to be segmented. It should be noted that the timestamps mentioned by the user (such as [970. 32-973.32)) may need to be retained in the paragraphs, but the user does not specify how to handle the timestamps, so it may need to retain or adjust the position according to the context.

In addition, some sentences may be repeated or need to be adjusted in order to enhance coherence, but according to the rules, no modification or deletion can be made. During the processing process, I will examine the hub of the drug delivery certificate in a way that ensures that nothing is missing. For example, in the original text, you may need to confirm whether it is a "pivotal hub" or other spelling error, but it cannot be modified according to the user's request, so keep it as it is. At the same time, note that the Chinese and English mixed parts such as "Pivotal Study" need to be preserved, not translated or replaced.

At the same time, pay attention to the use of transitional sentences to bridge the natural between paragraphs. During the processing process, there may be some challenges such as how to handle duplicate sentences (such as "we take one" appears twice) that need to ensure that nothing is deleted while keeping the paragraphs smooth. In addition, the processing of timestamps may require adjusting the position so that it does not affect the readability of the paragraphs, but the user has no clear instructions, so it may be necessary to retain the original position or appropriate adjustment.

[970. 32-973. 32] You will be the hub of the delivery certificate. [973. 32-974. 32] The Pivotal Study [974. 32-976. 32] will be based on the clinical results of your Phase II. [976. 32-978. 32] is used regardless of professional conditions. [978. 32-979. 32] Dosage. [979. 32-980. 32] The efficacy indicator. [980. 32-983. 32] Method of measurement, etc.

[982 32-984. 32] The entire three-phase Pivotal Study. [984. 32-986. 32] A great degree will rely on you. [986. 32-988. 32] Planning on the results of the second phase of the clinical trial. [988. 32-990. 32] So why is Compeb doing so many two. [990. 32-993. 32] is the best combination to find the entire experimental design. [993. 32-995. 32] That's when we enter the three-phase.

[995. 32-1004. 32] Basically, we are just expanding the number of people. [997. 32-1000. 32] It seems like you have taken a good exam every time you simulated it. [1000. 32-1002. 32] It's your time to take the exam or take the exam. [1002. 32-1004. 32] It's also natural that you can expect. [1004. 32-1005. 32] We take one. [1005. 32-1006. 32] We take one. [1005. 32-1006. 32] We take one.

[1006. 32-1009. 32] 0204 is an example of the local area of fat reduction design. [1009. 32-1011. 32] 0204 We are at the end of the procedure. [1011. 32-1013. 32] This BMI is 18.5 to 30. [1013. 32-1015. 32] Base 9 is the abdominal fat level before treatment. [1015. 32-1017. 32] is the third and fourth level. [1017. 32-1018. 32] Everyone.

[1018. 32-1020. 32] Up to four sessions can be played. [1020. 32-1022. 32] Approximately three weeks in between. [1022. 32-1025. 32] After finishing the last session four weeks of eight weeks of twelve weeks. [1025. 32-1028. 32] Will come back to follow-up to take a measurement. [1028. 32-1029. 32] The people were curious. [1029. 32-1031. 32] Most average subjects hit a few times.

[1031. 32-1033. 32] We counted it in 0204. [1033. 32-1035. 32] The subjects played only 1.5 times on average. [1035. 32-1036. 32] Chinese subtitles. [1036. 32-1037. 32] counts once. [1037. 32-1039. 32] So most of them played within two times. [1039. 32-1040. 32] actually worked.

[1040. 32-1042. 32] Okay, let's take a look at this abdomen scale. [1042. 32-1044. 32] Don't look at this abdomen scale. [1044. 32-1046. 32] In fact, this abdomen scale is just what I mentioned. [1046. 32-1048. 32] We are in compliance with regulations. [1048. 32-1050. 32] Especially the FDA regulatory requirements. [1050. 32-1051. 32] That's why we all know.

[1051. 32-1053. 32] Medical beauty is not intended to cure disease. [1053. 32-1055. 32] It is intended to pursue a better ordeal. [1055. 32-1058. 32] Therefore, the appearance of improvement as this efficacy indicator. [1058. 32-1059. 32] is required by the FDA. [1059. 32-1062. 32] This scale has been discussed before us. [1062. 32-1065. 32] It is valid for rigorous clinical development.

[1065. 32-1067. 32] It also follows the future listing. [1067. 32-1069. 32] The scene after the May Fourth listing is echoed. [1069. 32-1072. 32] Everyone wants you to drop from 3 to 4 to 1. [1072. 32-1074. 32] The people were wondering why we were graded. [1074. 32-1076. 32] Because we wanted to see how many people we could cut down on. [1076. 32-1078. 32]

[1078. 32-1079. 32] If you're going to be grade 2, [1079. 32-1081. 32] We can't see this phenomenon. [1081. 32-1082. 32] But I believe it when it's listed. [1082. 32-1084. 32] You're definitely a lot like that around me. [1084. 32-1085. 32] Rightly, it's grade 2 slimming. [1085. 32-1087. 32] He's also told him one day to lose weight.

[1088. 32-1088. 32] Many of these people. [1088. 32-1091. 32] will also be our client. [1091. 32-1092. 32] I may be here soon. [1092. 32-1094. 32] The waiting time is a bit limited. [1094. 32-1096. 32] Take a look at our 0202 to 0204. [1096. 32-1098. 32] The main results of this visit.

[1098. 32-1110. 32] Let's look directly at this comparison table. [1100. 32-1110. 32] You can see. [1101. 32-1103. 32] This transcript is very good. [1103. 32-1105. 32] This is probably the first one. [1105. 32-1108. 32] 85% or more people can cut it by 150%. [1108. 32-1110. 32] At that time we received 35.

[1110. 32-1111. 32] BMI is a little higher. [1111. 32-1112. 32] It starts from 0204. [1112. 32-1115. 32] We limit the BMI to below 30 people. [1115. 32-1119. 32] 76. 7% of people can improve a level. [1119. 32-1121. 32] When we reach 0205, we say, [1121. 32-1123. 32] How many people can reduce 20%.

[1123. 32-1124. 32] About 50%. [1124. 32-1125. 32] More than 50% of the people. [1125. 32-1127. 32] So we can see the same indicator. [1127. 32-1128. 32] It is repeated. [1128. 32-1130. 32] The therapeutic efficiency is also very close. [1130. 32-1132.] The treatment efficiency is also very close.

[1132. 32-1134. 32] is not a good time to reach the target. [1134. 32-1136. 32] is the May Fourth it is so effective. [1136. 32-1138. 32] That is in the safety section. [1138. 32-1140. 32] We have mentioned before. [1140. 32-1143. 32] We have collected more than 400 local papers. [1143. 32-1145. 32] 226 people in the drug group.

[1145. 32-1147. 32] has not appeared related to May Fourth. [1147. 32-1148. 32] Serious adverse events. [1148. 32-1150. 32] All adverse events are pinned. [1150. 32-1151. 32] Always hit too many pins. [11151 32-1153. 32] There will always be some bruises. [1153. 32-1154. 32] Pain redness, etc.

[1154. 32-1156. 32] Can be mitigated in two weeks. [1156. 32-1157. 32] Well that's it today. [1157. 32-1159. 32] Following these photos today's highlight. [1159. 32-1162. 32] Everyone was curious about the results of this experiment. [1162. 32-1164. 32] How do we use this story? [1164. 32-1167. 32] This is the subject of 0202.

[1167. 32-1169. 32] Those who can see our base line. [1169. 32-1173. 32] will have its BMI as well as its weight. [1173. 32-1175. 32] The correct answer is that we are in the test of this whole. [1175. 32-1177. 32] During the test process. [1177. 32-1180. 32] It cannot change weight more than 3 kg. [1180. 32-1182. 32] Because we want to exclude it because it is due to swelling.

[1182. 32-1185. 32] or the effect of weight loss. [1185. 32-1186. 32] That is from the side of this picture. [1186. 32-1188. 32] You can see this abdomen changes. [1188. 32-1189. 32] is very obvious. [1189. 32-1191] Okay, that starts at 0204. [1191.1194. 32] We use mri to measure this fat volume change.

[1194. 32-1196. 32] We used ultrasonic measurements before. [1196. 32-1198. 32] We started using mri to measure it. [1198. 321200. 32] You can see it all. [1200. 321202. 32] Whether this fat volume changes. [1202. 32-1205. 32] or the percentage is very good. [1205. 32-1206. 32] 0205 is the same.

[1206. 32-1208. 32] Take a quick look at this. [1208. 32-1209. 32] So many two phases. [1209. 32-1211. 32] So many good data. [1211. 32-1212. 32] We are indeed hopeful. [121212. 32-1215. 32] 514 This medical beauty signal developed by Taiwan. [1215. 32-1216. 32] Can take to the stage of the world.

[1216. 32-1219. 32] In fact, our face2a with 020 data. [1219. 32-1223. 32] has been published in the most authoritative journal of the medical and aesthetic fields. [1223. 32-1225. 32] Aesthetics Surgery Journal. [1225. 32-1226. 32] SJ above. [1226. 32-1228. 32] We also attended. [1228. 32-1230. 32] The most authoritative medical and aesthetic events incas.

[1230. 32-1231. 32] Two consecutive years have passed. [1231. 321234. 32] This is the annual meeting of our two-year participation. [1234. 32-1237. 32] The back of the host is also on board. [1237. 32-1238. 32] The relationship of time. [1238. 32-1239. 3

In fact, it is almost 100 kg of fat, which echoes the fact that their drugs are targeted for this overweight person. The drug will be more than a year later, 68 weeks, it can reduce this weight by about 15%, but in the body fat rate from base line 43 about 40, that is, it is only about 3.5%, that is, basically it is very limited effect on gradient fat. And thinning needles we often hear is that its weight is very heavy, including stomach discomfort, stomach discomfort, stomach vomiting, etc.

I think we had the opportunity to provide a good solution. We have done a small mouse experiment, and it is very simple to play GLP-1, and the middle started with 514, and then stopped with GLP-1. Let's see if we can improve or prevent this obesity. There are four groups, one of which has a group of three thin rats, two as a control group they do not play, so we just look at the two groups that have been playing drugs, one group is just playing GLP-1, and the other group is playing GLP-1 plus 514 together.

We look at the current situation of GLP-1 and the market outlook and estimate. In fact, from the 2023 Noah's EID launched a special weight loss drug, the two of them sold $1.2 billion last year, which even said the investment has been constantly adjusting the scale of the weight loss market, and the latest Morgan Stanley estimated to grow to 15 billion in 2035, so it is at least 10 times of the growth space now.

This is the first time that we have been able to achieve this goal in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, we are expected to send the RND, which is expected to take place in two hubs in Australia, Canada. In the second half of the year, we will reach this milestone by the beginning of the second quarter, and then we will be listed in the second quarter at the beginning of the 27th year.

As always, we would like to invite you to join us as we continue to support CANFET and support more new drugs developed by Taiwan's biopharmaceutical companies to take part in the international stage, and the world knows that Taiwan is not just a technological island but also a biotechnology island full of new drug R&D energy. Thanks to the wonderful sharing of the time, we also ask the Director to stay in touch.

Well, this question is because we will definitely step on the line, and we just mentioned the FORLOOKING prediction section, we can not be more inconvenient with the numbers, but there are really only a lot of manufacturers are going on DD, this should be able to say, there is a large factory in DD. As for the future of this authorization experience, I recommend you can refer to this big analyst roll in front of you, his report has helped us a lot of model, so we also think that it is good for us to refer to their report.

Thank you.
