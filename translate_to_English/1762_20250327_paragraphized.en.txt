All investors are welcome to participate in the online legal person briefing session of Sinopec Synthetic Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd. First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team representing today.

Welcome to General Manager Wei Qingpeng. Became the Vice President of Regular Sales. Hello, and Mr. Wang Guanjie, General Manager of Finance. Next, the company will carry out operational results and future outlook briefings in the fourth quarter of 2024.

If you have a question to ask, you can leave your company number and name in the chat room first. At QA time, we will open your microphone in sequential order. Ask the whole line. Next, we will take the time to present to the Deputy General Manager of Yiqin Chen.

Today is the fourth quarter of 2024. We will take a look at one of today's content. Well, here's our simple disclaimer. We haven't changed much if the company is open. The number of employees is about 300.

Then last year's revenue was about 13.47 million. We were founded in 1964 as the first US FDA-evaluated pharmaceutical manufacturer. In 97, we transformed into this biofermentation technology. A factory with the foundation of organic synthesis. In 2000, we also invested in an American company in Pennsylvania. In 2010, we were listed on the Taiwan stock market.

In addition to the general energy, chemical synthesis technology, we also have biological and fermentation technology. So we use two technologies to do some of the more special bases of the API, which is the API. Then we supply to the second also to the market, including Europe, etc. When we apply for that drug certificate, we will apply all our products in these markets the so-called long press of the drug is Drop Must Fire. This focus is also on the market that operates these regulations. Our company's ability to provide one-stop service to customers of different pharmaceuticals from small batches to mass production.

This is a list. The key point is that we have applied for DMF products in the United States, which also includes many, including hair fermentation, and the so-called semi-synthesis used in both technologies, such as an API. So we also added a new DMF product line in the previous years, and in addition to existing products, we have some new layouts and opportunities.

There are a few things to do with that community. They include together. There are some things to eat and there are those things to do. Simple gifts to care for around us. These need care. Elderly people are with their neighbors.

This is the third verse of the Qur'an that says: "And whoever turns away from the Reminder (i.e. the Qur'an) and turns away from the Reminder (i.e. the Qur'an), then whoever turns away from the Reminder (i.e. the Qur'an) and turns away from it (i.e. the Qur'an) and turns away from it (i.e. turns away from the Reminder (i.e. the Qur'an), turns away from the Reminder (i.e. the Qur'an)."

A good company would be willing to register. Such a platform we also get in front of. At least 35% of the GEO vendors. We should, of course, in terms of prospects. It also illustrates the magnification of CostcoBudget and EV at the same time.

We also gradually increase the penetration of the market. That is in the regulation. Registration and change through this regulation. This is one of the very important things we do for Life Cycle. When optimizing the changes, we can take more. Efficiency is more competitive process to import and then expand the market for one occupation.

This requires a lot of work. One is working with the client. So it is also relative. Many A guests have a great value that he is willing to put into further one. Expand one of the markets. Including a change in the quality of the regulation and the official to apply for approval, etc.

But these things are quite straightforward in some respects. If all goes through a model like this, it is also very expensive for the customer to replace us with another one, so it's a business unit that strengthens us.

We are not talking about the original. The oldest process is the same or even the same. It is already on the market. The optimization of a mass production product or process is included. The quality is also able to maintain the same standard as the original one.

Want to increase revenue. Come to the kinetic energy of the growth of a new drug. That even has some of us. A CMO of scientifically known drugs. Including our customers are in Europe. Then our products are the same.

Start selling in that European market. This is one of our future prospects. Functionality. The new product line is also the main one we use for this fermentation or synthesis.

We have some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them, some of them.

Some of them are P4 and P3 products. A simple explanation is that these are relatively. It may be about 5 to 10 years is P4 products. It is a unique positioning. But its time should be relatively long.

The fifth product of which we have just mentioned is this Semaglutime. Now in that one, including the European market in the United States. This new drug company has also been very successful. We are now in the layout, but we are using a more special method. Because most of the time.

Of course, the way to use it, of course. The chemical synthesis of the more traditional way is to use our own new technology. Can't say new. That's one.

There is very competitive. A technique used for biological fermentation. Instead of using fossil synthesis. To get into such a market. We can understand that in the process we come to this product the cost is better.

This is the kind of process that is important to us, so we have to explain it as well. This investment has been made, and the amplification is also very good.

It is said that the greatest potential of the future is one of the products. The other to see below is that this P3 is the layout in a relatively short period of time. Products that can be listed include

The most obvious is that there will be some customers involved in this year. Do one of the research and development. Ready to send the goods to do BABE. So these development if they are. Buy later to do it. BABE is called biochemical products.

This is the test of biological equality. Send the ENDA of the well-known medicine. This is the application of the pharmacological needle of the well-known medicine. It is the same as changing the supplier. The threshold is high.

This is the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the year of the Lord's return, the month of the Lord's return, and the year of the Lord's return.

"This is the year of our Lord's return, the year of our Lord's return, the year of our Lord's return, the year of our Lord's return, the year of our Lord's return, the year of our Lord's return, and the year of our Lord's return.

This is the main outlook for the future. The following is our simple abbreviation. Let's take a look at it. That's the part of our company today.

You can do it again. Further explanation. Thanks to Vice President Chen for the briefing. Then we'll take a look at our new project.

You can directly. Thank you for contacting the gene to ask your question. Please refer to the part of the raw fish oil. There is anything on our market. Describe or look forward to it.

Thank you for this present time. We are talking about a new order. We are talking about a new order. In fact, every time we introduce a situation like this, we are going to introduce a situation like this.

The situation is a relatively low downturn, which is relative to the highest one. Because of this, the product, especially the one he did last year. This was the biggest recession that he also influenced us. Even in the US, the share of the original market was that I was the United States.

Our revenues are higher than ours. Last year it was because of this. A recession of a single product fell that was really the case. The market aspect, including price and quantity, is not the same as the highest period in the world today.

The old orders continued to ship, but it was much smaller than the previous ones. We are now working with our customers. We are going to talk about a new order. Of course, we expect that we will know the results soon, but we are not here today. There is a way to explain one of them.

Size or how, but if this is the case. Ours is to say that in such a quantity, etc., can maintain a basic amount. I must also point out that this we have encountered last year. Many challenges include that I have.

It is also reported earlier that the oil of the upstream is the raw material. It is said that the upstream is this. The raw material part of the fish oil looks like it is currently this quarter. Or the more relief is to say that last year, because the raw material is rising, there are still these out-of-stock problems.

In fact, it slows down.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, sorting them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided transcription, pay attention to the timestamps and the corresponding sentences.

For example, a sequence of sentences may belong to the same paragraph, and a larger interval of time may require segmentation. Then, I will process each sentence to ensure that they are arranged in chronological order without missing anything. At the same time, pay attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any sentence", so all sentences, including possibly unconsistent parts, must be retained. For example, there are some seemingly unrelated questions or technical terms in the middle, such as "ame", "developing", etc., and these also need to be retained as well.

In addition, some sentences may be duplicated or redundant, but according to the user's requirements, all must be retained. It is also necessary to pay attention to the use of punctuation marks to ensure that each sentence ends with the correct punctuation, such as a sentence or question mark. At the same time, when processing timestamps, it may be necessary to keep them in paragraphs, but the user does not specify whether it is necessary to retain timestamps, so further confirmation may be required.

For example, in the example provided by the user, there is a large interval between timestamps, which may indicate different speakers or topic transitions, which requires appropriate segmentation. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I will read the entire paragraph typed text to check if all the sentences are correctly arranged with no omissions or errors. At the same time, make sure that no additional content is added and that the original data is handled entirely according to the user's requirements. In conclusion, the process needs to be carefully handled every sentence, maintaining the original intention and structure, and segmenting in chronological and logical relationships to ensure that the final results meet all the user's requirements.

This is not the case, but it is the case that he has been told that he has not changed much in the year of sales, and that he has been told that he has been paid more than a year ago and that he has been reduced in the year of decline. This is the most important change so we expect that this year when we have a new order, it may be better than it was last year, but I just said that because even now we are very hard to talk about this with our customers is a price problem, so the two variables can not expect to be his contribution, how much we know that it is not possible to return to the highest level of shipping, this part of the situation is that he has not reduced in fact, but we are now saying that it is that he has a lot of the same stock price that he wants to buys.
