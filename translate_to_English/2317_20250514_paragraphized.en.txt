We have more than 10 locations in Europe and India, and we have accumulated years of experience in local operations and abundant human resources. Such a layout allows us to quickly respond to our customers' needs. This year, our cloud network products or the latest products, our cloud network products are the main growth momentum. Looking back at the first quarter, the performance of our AI server business is remarkable, which means that the demand for computing power is still very strong, whether it is an AI server or a general-purpose server, shipments are significantly increased. From a customer point of view, the major CSP plants in North America this year have announced that they will continue to expand their investment in AI infrastructure, and with the rapid growth of training and reasoning AI, the volume of our server shipments can grow significantly.

At the GTC conference in March, we showcased the results of AI Factory-focused smart manufacturing applications, and the first time we have publicly announced the launch of NeuroBot, a medical robot that can safely assist and send hospital inspections, and a semiconductor composite robot that combines automatic handling capabilities. In addition, we have introduced digital warming technology in server production lines, robot assembly, and general assembly simulation of electric bus factories, which has helped us improve efficiency and facility planning. In terms of GENAI, we have also actively introduced the intelligent management technology of GENETIC AI, hoping to improve the efficiency and data integration capabilities of our factories.

As for the development of semiconductors, we are in the process of mass production according to the progress of the second quarter. At the same time, we have superior technical specifications in the field of next-generation SIC MOSFETs, which can significantly improve the efficiency of power conversion and reduce energy waste, this part, we are expected to enter mass production in the second half of the year. As for the design services of 3DIC, we have officially entered this high threshold, become one of the few manufacturers in Taiwan to provide this service, we are expected to enter the AI ASIC chip design services this year, and gradually expand the business layout in Europe, America and Southeast Asia.

**Note:

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

For example, the first sentence is, "We have also expanded a collection of third-party RBA VAPs," followed by "timed six months to complete a collection that spans nine major parks around the world," which need to be combined in a continuous manner to form a natural paragraph. It is necessary to pay attention to the logical relationship between the sentences, and it may be necessary to adjust the order or add the connection, but the user requests do not rewrite, so it can only be arranged in the original order. Then, deal with the Q&A section. For example, the question of tariffs, the question of the user and the answer of the chairman need to be segmented, but the original statement remains unchanged.

It is important to pay attention to the beginning of each question and answer, and it may be necessary to distinguish between different speakers with a line change or indentation. During the process, pay special attention to the processing of timestamps. The user's example, timestamps are enclosed in parentheses, but no timestamp is required in the final output, so these timestamps need to be deleted only retain the content. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that each sentence's integrity, for example, "[1122. 32-1123. 36] comes to 200%" may be checked if it is correct, since "200%" may be a mistake, but the user requests do not modify the content, so the original must be preserved.

For example, "[1222. 32-1223. 36] came to 200% [1223. 40-1224. 68] 33", where the user may be required to merge into "200% 33", but the user request is not rewritten, so the separation of the question and the answer should be taken directly. For example, the question section and answer section should be separated, but the user does not require segmentation, so it may be necessary to determine whether the row needs to be changed according to the context or otherwise. But there is no specific explanation for the user, so it may only be ordered in the original order. Finally, check whether the whole paragraph is smooth, to ensure that there are no missing sentences, and all contents are arranged in the original order.

At the same time, make sure that no additional content is added or deleted. Once you've finished reading, you'll be sure to meet all the requirements of your users. In addition, we've also expanded a collection of third-party RBA VAPs, which took half a year to complete a collection across nine major campuses around the world, with a comprehensive boost of confidence and implementation of ESG supply chain management.

In addition, we also participated in the Taipei International Motor Show, and showed the latest developments in electric vehicles, automotive components and localized batteries. Finally, at Computex next week, we also participated in the exhibition, welcome you to visit us and appreciate the latest generation of AI server cabinets and the application of robots in the three smart platforms. Thank you James, and then we enter the second stage of the conference, we will report to the President of the meeting, and then open up free questions.

In recent years, due to the changes in tariff policies, the most important issue for businesses is the degree of globalization layout and the resilience of the supply chain. Fortunately, many years ago, we have developed a more regionalized layout that can be flexible to adapt to the needs of customers, which has a relatively light impact. Now, in order to match the overall supply chain, under a strategy of supplying geopolitical risks and diversification of the supply chain, we have continuously carried out a capacity roll-up of global capacity, and are also accelerating and accelerating our layout to strengthen our ability to deliver regionally manufactured areas.

We use USD as the main trading currency, so the revenue and cost of most of the transactions can form a natural hedge, but the functional currency of the group is Taiwan Dollar, so the exchange rate fluctuations of the US Dollar will affect the performance of our accounts. As for the profit and profit of the industry, we will continue to reduce the impact of the US Dollar's foreign exchange rate by about 3%. However, we will also reduce the impact of the US Dollar's foreign exchange rate, which may affect the exchange rate of the industry's stock price, and the foreign currency's profit and loss, for example, the US Dollar's profit and loss.

In addition, our company has a set of policy guidelines in response to exchange rate fluctuations, for example, to increase the frequency of quotations and reduce the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations by using a variety of measures such as appropriate financial avoidance tools, hedged business investments, and the risk of exchange rates arising from financing activities. Thank you, Mr. Cao, the next question is the last question. If you want to ask a question online, you can now click the raise symbol to wait, and we will open to online legal and media free questions after the next Q&A. What is the last question you want to ask your friends?

First of all, I would like to ask, is there any change in the growth of our quarter? Is there any change in our quarter growth? Is there any change in our quarter growth? Is there any change in our quarter growth? Is there any change in our quarter growth? We benefited from continued growth in computing power demand in the first quarter, as well as the continued growth of new platforms, both significantly improved AI server and general-purpose server shipment performance, with a significant increase in revenue by more than 50%, but not doubled, mainly because the GB series entered a large-scale production phase at the end of the first quarter, so most products were delivered only in the second quarter.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the overall server business to continue to grow, with the increase in revenue and year-on-year growth eager to achieve high double-digit growth. In terms of AI servers, GB series capacity has improved continuously, and we have also developed ASIC-based AI servers with several CSP customers.

**Chairman:** And the main customer's demand for AI, we are very confident in the growth of AI server revenue, which will reach more than trillions of revenue, accounting for more than 50% of the total server share. Thank you to the Chairman. We are now open to legal and media questions, and we are welcome to come to the Q&A program, and English questions are welcome. **The host:** Well, the first question we ask Morgan Stanley analyst Sharon. **Sharon:**

Well, Mr. Liu, Chief Financial Officer James, I'm Sharon, there are two questions I want to ask first. The first question is whether we have some updates on the flagship mobile phone in India, and our big customers mentioned in the recent teleconference that India can meet the needs of the U.S. market in the future, so I don't know if it is possible to ask the chairman to tell us whether the future of this smartphone in India can meet the needs of the U.S. market.

In particular, for the major production bases including Mexico United States India, and today, we are also very concerned about whether there will be some additional AI capacity planning in the Middle East? Is this the KPX that will continue to maintain high-end? Because if we see that our KPX or a relatively large sustained expenditure, Working capital seems to continue to grow, and so we have been able to invest in the future in addition to making this debt to support, is there a plan? This is two questions, thank you. ** Chairman: ** Thank you Sharon. We do not comment on the single customer or single customer's products, so we can answer the situation in India, the overall view that the layout of each place needs long-term operation, especially technical capabilities, we have a strong training system and a large field, we can quickly cultivate the ability of employees in recent years can reach 90 million, which shows Hong Hai in the complete management and training capacity, in the market.

**CFO:** Thank you, in the last book we will mention, because there are more business opportunities and more cooperation opportunities this year, so the expected capital expenditure will continue to increase, more than 20%, such a view has not changed, which we expect to have 60% to 70% of the expansion capacity for expansion capacity, others are automation, 60% to 70% of the expansion capacity include in India Vietnam, the United States, Mexico and other regions, but just you mentioned that in the Middle East should not see this in this year, it will gradually contribute to the new business in the Middle East, we will expand new business in China, in the United States, Taiwan India will also have new business investment, we have a lot of years of global economic and economic changes, we can also allow us to respond to the changes in the current situation of the international economy, as well, as the next year we have to meet the needs of the future of the company, we have to cooperate with the company.

Thank you, Mr. Liu, James, my question here is probably based on the overall demand and supply, which is why the tariff is the reason why. ** Host:** Thank you, Sharon, we do not comment on a single customer or a single customer, I can answer the situation of the overall situation in India, the overall view that every place layout needs long-term operation, especially technical capabilities, we have a strong training system and a large-scale field, can quickly cultivate the ability of colleagues, in recent years can reach 90 million people, which can show that Hon Hai in the full management system, to say that we have entered this market in 2006, during this period accumulated the ability to manage the supply chain and logistics of local employees, these important competitive advantages are also we can rapidly expand in the past years, Hong Hai will keep in touch with customer needs, including future capacity planning and assembly, component layout will cooperate with customers, as long as we see more and we see more suppliers in the complete the supply chain, and we expect the more and the more, the full situation of the full supply chain, India should be gradually appear, the competitiveness of the financial minister. ** ** **CFO: ** ** ** ** Moderator: **

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and sort it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to ensure that the user-provided rules are not deleted, rewritten, or condensed with any of the original content. The user specifically emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them one by one to make sure that there are no omissions. Next, I will look at the transcription fragments of the user-provided transcription.

First of all, I need to identify each speaker's speech and consolidate the sequential sentences of the same speaker into paragraphs. For example, the first speaker starts with [2091. 14-2095. 24] and ends with [2118. 28-210. 58], which should be combined into a paragraph. Next, there may be other speakers, such as "Spotify is absolutely" and "Gi vienen before there is a circulating", which may belong to different speakers and need to be handled separately. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to different parts of the same speaker, such as [2168. 98-2171. 18] to [2239. 36-2240. 16], which should be combined into a consistent paragraph.

In addition, some sentences may contain words after timestamps, such as [2240. 18-2242. 08] to [2243. 22-2245. 22], which need to be kept in their original order and correctly segmented. It is also important to note that some sentences may be wrongly split, such as "Is that a troublesome chairman" and "or" may be the same problem and need to be merged. During the process, I will check the sequence of sentences to ensure that each sentence is correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamps, to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, without interrupts or mispositions. For example, from [2245. 2224.2246. 82] to [2249. 90-2252.2.12] may be different parts of the same problem and need to merge.

At the same time, check whether the transition between paragraphs is smooth, whether it meets the natural flow of meetings or interviews. If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to further analyze the context to ensure that the views and questions of each speaker are accurately presented. </think> The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim transcript (fully retains all the original sentences, only adjust the paragraph structure): --- [2091. 14-2095. 24] In fact, the customer is currently pulling here in advance. [2095. 24-2098. 06] More or more, there are some actions. [2098. 06-2100. 62]

[2100. 62-2102. 92] Which products are online. [2102. 92-2104. 70] We are currently in the first half of the year. [2104. 70-2107. 52] We have seen this more obvious. [2107 52-2109. 32] Pre-stocking phenomenon. [2109. 32-2115. 20] These products will worry about its momentum in the second half of the year. [2115. 20-2118. 28] Will it be lower than this in the first half of the year.

[2118. 28-2120. 58] That may not be a trouble for the chairman. [2120. 58-2121. 10] or [212121. 10-2123. 14] may be a problem now. [2123. 14-2125. 20] It may be possible to keep Spotify on indefinitely. [2125. 20-2126. 94] Gi vienen also mentioned a circulating event. [2126. 94-2128. 28] is a Google incident.

[2128. 28-2130. 06] zurück is here. [2130. 06-2131. 08] Keystone [2131. 08-2143. 12] There is something before us. [2143. 12-2149. 22] Full of Ed minutes α. [2149. 22-2150. 84] I consume. [2150. 84-2151. 06] What are their problems. [2150. 84-2115. 06] Strong or significant growth. [2151. 06]

[2153. 70-2156. 68] This is indeed the last five years. [2156. 68-2161. 02] In addition to the pandemic caused the production schedule adjustment. [2161. 02-2164. 02] Very rare to see two product categories. [2166. 02166. 00] It can grow at the same time. [2166. 00-2168. 98] I think this phenomenon should have been affected. [2168. 98-2171. 18] The effect of the tariff pre-loading.

[2171. 18-2172. 84] These two categories. [2172. 84-2177. 18] This is based on our April revenue performance. [2177. 18-2180. 26] Consume this smart product. [2180. 26-2183. 28] The pull-up movement continues. [2183. 28-2188. 82] But the second quarter should still gradually enter the traditional low season. [2188. 82-2192. 86] Other computer terminal products perform in the second quarter.

[2192. 86-2195. 58] will also be relatively flat. [2195. 58-2199. 90] Because the tariff policy is not so clear. [2199. 90-2205. 08] And the market landscape remains very uncertain. [2205. 08-2206. 98] We will pay close attention to some changes in these terminal requirements. [2206. 98-2210. 18] Pay attention to some changes in these terminal requirements. [2210. 18-2213. 58] The current environment changes significantly.

[2213. 58-2214. 46] And very soon. [2214. 46-2216. 04] So for the second half of the year. [2216. 04-2219. 26] We hold a relatively prudent view. [2219. 26-2220. 94] Prudent view. [2220. 94-2224. 40] This year's operating environment was relatively challenging. [2224. 40-2228. 68] But we believe it is under the advantage of the Group's global layout.

[2228. 68-2231. 66] We can get the most out of it. [2231. 66-2234. 88] We have the advantage of resilience in our supply chain. [2234. 88-2236. 58] So the second half of the year. [2236. 58-2239. 36] I think we still have a lot of opportunities. [2239. 36-2240. 16] Can fight. [2240. 18-2242. 08] More orders.

[2242. 08-2243. 22] and above. [2243. 22-2245. 22] Good next question. [2245. 22-2246. 82] Good thanks to the chairman. --- [2246. 82-2249. 90] That's exactly what I've heard. [2249. 90-2252. 12] It's really what I've heard. [2252. 12-2253. 94] Consumer-related products.

[2253. 94-2255. 36] may be more similar. [2255. 36-2257. 70] may be forwarded in advance. [2257. 70-2259. 82] or the case of more variables. [2259. 82-2261. 66] That's what we understand in AI. [2261. 66-2263. 16] This is our understanding. [2263. 16-2264. 56] Just as you mentioned.

[2264. 56-2267. 40] The second quarter may begin to enter larger mass production. [2267. 40-2269. 66] It will be more promising later. [2270. 18-2272. 48] That's what you want to know. [2272. 48-2275. 30] The AI is about our supply chain. [2275. 30-2278. 06] Some components and even upstream chip terminals. [2278. 06-2281. 00] In fact, it has been seen in the last two quarters.

[2281. 00-2283. 28] has been expanded in volume. [2283. 28-2284. 48] That's what I'd like to ask. [2284. 48-2287. 72] Now it's in our final assembly. [2287. 72-2290. 82] In a process like this to our customers. [2290. 82-2293. 82] What are some bottlenecks? [2293. 82-2295. 86] Need to be solved.

[2295. 86-2299. 42] Or, in fact, it should be later. [2299. 42-2300. 02] Yes. [2300. 02-2302. 58] Almost reached a very smooth level. [2302. 58-2303. 64] Can be expected. [2303. 64-2305. 40] That's what I want to ask. [2305. 40-2308. 52] There's nothing going to be in the middle of it now.

[2308. 52-2312. 88] There are some solutions that need to be improved again. [2312. 88-2315. 40] That will not affect us all year round. [2315. 40-2318. 40] The original idea number. [2318. 40-2320. 20] Thank you. [2320. 20-2321. 18] The Angela. [2321. 18-2324. 24] Our business model.

[2324. 24-2329. 10] Let's not be able to comment on a single customer's product. [2329. 10-2329. 98] I can. [2330. 02-2332. 58] The overall answer. [2332. 58-2336. 42] Your general response. [2336. 42-2340. 26] Your concern. [2340. 26-2343. 58] We look at the current.

[2343. 58-2346. 66] The whole AI server rack is mass production. [2346. 66-2349. 98] The cabinet is not a server. [2349. 98-2352. 04] The climb is fast. [23552. 04-2355. 36] The yield is also on the rise. [2355. 36-2358. 44] Overall, I think it will be better. [2360. 02-2365. 90] The entire cloud network product revenue can be seen in April.

[2365. 90-2371. 02] We have strong growth in the month to month and year. [2371. 02-2372. 56] From here we can see. [2377. 56-2377. 42] A contribution to the growth of the AI server cabinet. [2377. 42-2378. 70] With that. [2378. 70-2380. 76] We are gradually mature in mass production. [2380. 76-2384. 86] I believe we are shipping our AI server cabinets in the coming quarters.

[2384. 86-2386. 64] will continue to grow. [2386. 64-2388. 94] The quarter will be better than the quarter. [2388. 94-2389. 46] Good. --- [2390. 02-2393. 06] That is because it is the system. [2392. 06-2393. 60] System-level AI. [2393. 60-2393. 18] The cabinet of the server is in the process of production.

[2397. 18-2403. 58] It has a large number of software and hardware integration testing requirements. [2403. 58-2408. 20] Our engineering team is constantly working with customers. [2408. 20-2412. 04] To optimize the entire production process. [2412. 04-2417. 16] Then to introduce a variety of automation technologies to improve our production. [2417. 16-2418. 18] Efficiency. [2418. 18-2419. 98] Up to date.

[2420. 02-2422. 84] See the technical capabilities of these engineering. [2422. 84-2426. 16] is able to help our customers in a timely manner. [2426. 16-2431. 02] handles the hardware and software side of this problem and needs. [2431. 02-2435. 38] It is also a big affirmation of our customers. [2435. 38-2437. 42] is better than that. [2437. 42-2441. 26] Good for the next question we ask.

[2441. 26-2447. 42] City Carrie's request. [2447. 42-2449. 46] Chief Financial Officer and James. [2449. 46-2445. 56] The first question to ask is about this. [2453. 56-2445. 60] GB200 part. [2455. 60-2460. 72] I just mentioned that most of the current production bottlenecks have been resolved. [2460. 72-2466. 86] I do not know whether the order status of the customers from the chairman's side has been confirmed.

[2466. 86-2472. 50] The low-quarters are slightly lower in volume production. [2472. 50-2478. 14] The estimate above this order for the whole year. [2478. 14-2478. 38] It is good to come back to the question of whether this order is above this estimate because the low-quarters are slightly lower in volume production due to the whole year. [2478. 38-2480. 68] It is good to come back to the question. [2480. 68-2483. 24]

That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.

The demand is full. The demand is full. Understanding. But the chairman wants to follow up with you again. That's the problem with the production bottleneck.

That's GB200. Obviously, for everyone it's a new product complexity is very high. That's because it's the next generation. GB300 is on the design. It's the hope to improve on the 200.

So. In this case. The supply chain is expected to produce a smoother performance at the same time as performance. GB200 is going to be better. Therefore, there has always been some voice that our mid-term customers might have this to convert to GB200.

GB300 is a requirement. Production may be lower than expected throughout the year. So I don't know if this is the observation or not of the chairman. I don't really think that's the case. That's the man I want to be. It's coming soon.

This is not the case for us, but for him, and for us, and for him, and for him, and for us, and for him, and for him, and for us, and for him, and for him, and for him, and for us, and for him, and for him, and for all.

The experience of GB200. Including the design of this whole machine for heat dissipation system to automate production and testing. Technical. Yes. Greatly shortened. We are in GB.

The future is not just GB300, but we have to think about the future. This future is this AI. The cabinet AI server cabinet. This is the production.

This is the best way to do this, and I think it's better to do this, but the next question is, what do we need to do?

We didn't say that at the beginning of the year. The third foot of Hon Hai. The good news right away is to take the Mitsubishi electric car order. Can't ask the chairman to share with us the group's cooperation plan with the Japanese factory.

Well, like we've been with this Mitsubishi company, MOU. We've. Work may be around a year. We've been waiting for you.

But it also took a long time, that is, another car factory, of course, we got in touch, and of course, there were some progress.

We do not have any tags for I'm Not The One [Instrumental] lyrics.

Other manufacturers. In the conversation of similar cooperation. So in this regard. Please wait. Please wait.

Next question we ask. Voice-over question voiceover. Is there a voiceover? Yes, please. The Chairman and James are welcome. Computex will be held next week.

The Chairman's Keynote session is currently closed due to insufficient registration. Can you please ask the Chairman to take a look at it first. What you want to share with the outside world and what you want to share with the public will not be the presence of the mysterious guest. Thank you for the voiceover. This year we at Computex Keynote.

We will use AI Factory as the theme. Combine the three platforms of our group. There is also the application of robots. Analysis.

And in the midst of it, and in the midst of it, and in the midst of it, and in the midst of it, and in the midst of it, and in the midst of it, and in the midst of it.

Mental. and. Sports referrals. Yes. Accepts. Affiliates.

One of them is a book, one of them is a book, or one of them is a book.

Yes. Some. Integrated. Possible. Difficulty cier things. Different.

Also. I approached Morgan's analyst Albert to ask a question. Albert Liu Dong, Chief Financial Officer. I have two questions. The first one is when I remember 19 years ago.

The first time I met Liu Dong, I was talking about this. Liu Dong you mentioned this to me. This trend of Regional Manufacturing Center. This trend has not only been in the past years, but also the trend of the entire industry.

Just mentioned by the Chief Financial Officer. We have increased the opening rate this year. This is also mentioned in the same industry. This opening rate will also increase. I would like to know what to say.

Shares across the industry. Increasingly. Investors are worried that this part will not cause a decrease in ROIC. Or this one now. This so-called Regional Hub.

They are more willing to pay more money than they want to pay. different production places. this is my first point. the first question. I answer the first question.

Our Business Model. All of us are OEMs with this EMS. Our OEMs are electronic. We are our customers. Most of them reflect the cost of our manufacturing. Plus a Markup.

"This is our Lord's will, and we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants; we are His servants."

This structure is about 90% of this raw material, about 90% of it. The salary is probably only 5% of the inside, so the increase of 56 percent of the total cost is limited, that percentage is limited. So I think that this is mainly the last decision that our customers should make, the second I think it is a trend, the customer may also have to adapt to this trend, the recently mentioned is the U.S. this factor, but also accelerated the customer to do such an adjustment, good, this is the first question, I answer, thank you very much, I am about this part of the Middle East, on the front of this NV its press, I just said that this Middle East customers about a year, about 7 or even a thousand of the RAC, I know that we may not be a single customer to do Comment, I want to know that this economic scale is less than a thousand, in this year, so that the customer will be the next time we will be able to buy this product with the same product, we will be able to add this product?

If you want to avoid tariffs, it is not the chairman, or the company sells the U.S. to India production, that is, most of the U.S. customers are more likely, no matter who you know, the U.S. customers are your proportion, most of the U.S. customers, but your production base is almost here in China, then I want to ask the chairman is to say that I have done an analysis, I do not know the chairman's opinion, that is, I am not sure that this is the chairman's opinion, that is, it is about 30%, that the second most important part of the U.S. revenue share this product line, then it should be here in Europe, that is very interesting, I think about this product line, that is probably sold to Southeast Asia, this is about 21%, that if you want to avoid tariffs, or the company sell the U.S.

*The labor cost is probably only in the back. *The fifth percent bar. *The increase in this fifth. *The effect on the total cost is limited. *The percentage is limited. *I think that.

*This is the main one. *The first one is our client. *The second I think it is a trend. *The client may also have to.

*To adapt to this trend. *That's what you just mentioned. *This is the U.S. factor. *This also accelerates the customer to do it. *An adjustment. *Changes.

*This is the first question. *I answered. *Thank you very much. *My question is still about. *The Middle East section.

*This is NV in the morning. *Press release. *I'm a little more aware of this. *This is the Middle East customer. *Yes, it is possible. *Taiwan.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to keep the original, just adjust the format. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine the sequenced sentences into a coherent paragraph while retaining everything.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic or to the same person's speech, and should be combined, and there should be segmentation between different topics or different people's speech. First of all, I will check one by one to see which sentences can be combined. For example, the first paragraph may include the content of arrangements and tariffs, the next is the part of the question and answer, and the last one is the end of the sentence.

In addition, pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the converted paragraphs remain in their original time order and speaking order. It is also important to pay attention to the correct use of punctuation and format, such as using a period or line change at the end of each paragraph, but the user does not specifically request a format, so it may only be necessary to separate the paragraphs with a line change. At the same time, make sure that no extra content is added and only the format is adjusted. Finally, I will read the entire converted paragraph-based script to check if all the original content is properly preserved without omissions or error merging.

One possible arrangement, it does something in different countries. That is through such arrangement, to reduce the overall tariffs. These are all happening. I think you can go this way and ask for proof. What kind of customer do you care about?

That's the second question I've heard of, and I've just heard that this is the ASIC server. Can you please tell me if the company is doing level 10 or level 10 in this regard? Is the customer also doing these large CSPs in North America? That's also the server of AI. I see that the company is investing in this Houston.

That's because I don't know the president, maybe you're familiar with the industry, that's because the U.S. now needs to take these manufacturing back to the U.S. The TSMC is also in the U.S., which may produce more advanced chips in the future. That's not to say that the whole more important customer, the high-end chip to Arizona is produced, and then to make a comparison of the front-end board in the U.S., the board is before L6. This may happen in two or three years. So if you want to ask the president, this is my second question.

OK. Ok. Your logic is correct about what to do in the United States, and your logic is correct about what to do there, of course this IC, where to make a module, and then build this PCBA there, and then assemble it into a server, and then turn it into a level level 11, so this logic is right. As for this question, I think there is still time for this sequence, and that is to see how much the whole manufacturer's supply chain ready.

You know that CSP clients have developed their own ASICs. That's probably referring to their CSP clients' ASICs and will do level 10. Well, now it's 3:59, we open the last question, and we'll ask this Marquari Kalin.

Kalin heard it. Kalin heard it. Kalin heard it. Kalin heard it. Did Kalin hear it? Hey, can you hear me?

I would like to ask you about our 2025 revenue outlook, but if you look at the product, our arrow direction is not really adjusted. I would like to ask you, what is the relationship between the exchange rate, the overall adjustment of all product lines, or what kind of outlook? Or do we see what product lines may be larger downside? Well, your assumption is correct, because of the exchange rate.

That's why we've always emphasized here that we're more prudent about the possibility of the exchange rate. We don't see any possible changes either. That's because of this, because it may change, so we have a lower outlook on revenue. That's why we don't see any other changes.
