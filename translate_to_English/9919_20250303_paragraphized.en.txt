<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim fragment provided by the user in a manner that pays attention to the sentence corresponding to each timestamp.

First, I will identify the subject of each paragraph. For example, the beginning part is about the beginning and disclaimer of the meeting, and then the company profile, financial information, and future strategies. Each section may require a combination of related sentences to form a naturally smooth paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may be overlapping or duplicated in timestamps, such as the user mentions "good then we're here because of the timestamp" and "good then we're here because of the timestamp," which needs to be confirmed whether it's duplicated, but according to the original source provided by the user, may be the error of the timestamp, should retain the original sentence.

In addition, some sentences may need to be adjusted in grammar or structure to ensure the connection between paragraphs. For example, in the context of the disclaimer, the user is divided into multiple timestamps that need to be combined into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the order of the original sentence. When dealing with the financial data section, the user mentions several factors that lead to loss, such as loss of Yangzhou plant, cost of the new plant, and fire incident.

After the first draft, read it again, confirm the correct position of each sentence, the transition between paragraphs is natural, and strictly adhere to all instructions of the user. </think> [paragraph verbatim]: It's good to start thanks. Well, now that we've got time, we've officially started the content description of our speech. Well, first of all, I want you to take a look at the disclaimer before we officially explain it, so let's briefly talk about the focus of the disclaimer.

The second is that we may have some simple statements in the description, which we actually write in the text, which we want to ensure that it is correct and complete, and does not mean that we see relative industry conditions or follow-up focus, or some complete discussion of development. The third is that the third is to remind that all of the above today, without our company's written consent, we want to use it arbitrarily. Well, we start a report today, then we start a report today, the first part is about the company's profile, the second part is the financial information, and the third is we will briefly explain the company's future business strategy. Well, I think you may not be familiar, because we are also a listed company for many years, we are now 55, and the total number of our employees is about 761 by the end of January.

So in the quality certification part because the quality of the product is really very important to the company, because the quality of the product is actually a very important part of the company, so we are very active in the whole of the quality of the operation of the certification is also very important. Then some of the content of these certifications is actually a lot I don't think I'm going to tell you the first step in the process. So we look at the core technology and application part of the whole Kang Naxiang, I'm sorry I'm a bit uncomfortable with the throat. I think we are in fact the core technology we focus in two parts of the production technology and product development, in the production technology I want to have a more special place in the design of our machinery, so we have a lot of machine design, the new equipment or the machine is good, we have a lot of our company has its own - how to work with the external manufacturers, so we said that we are very highly flexible, so on the whole machinery, so we are very highly highly flexible.

In 1969, we put in some high-tech fiber fabrics for product development and development, which in the part of sanitary cotton is roughly divided into four categories of products, which is the main category of the company, accounting for about 55% of our company's revenue, which is in fact now with sanitary cotton pads, this part of our company is in the market accounted for us or the first three decline in the proportion of the company. The sanitary cotton pads is especially special that we should be in Asia to produce a small number of manufacturers of sanitary cotton pads, the part of the diapers we cover the baby diapers and adult diapers, which currently accounts for about 13% of the company, then is the couple products, including wipe cloths, etc., especially in the fact, the proportion of the proportion of the market share of the company's, that are currently accounted for 21% of the company's revenue. The second part of the explanation is the whole financial information, then we first see the whole year of the entire revenue part is about 2.9 billion yuan, then we have two major factors in the last year is our Yangzhou plant, because the whole Chinese market his scene is low, so the whole Yangzhou has a relatively large loss in addition to the second part is in our talk new factory, the new factory in the end of the previous year began to be in place, the entire equipment began to be assembled, and the company in this market research and so on has also started to enter, so there are some high costs and expenses, so in this piece also generated a relatively high cost and cost, the third part is because we have a fire incident in February last year, the part of the fire also affect the entire company although a total asset on the assets of fire insurance, etc. these assets cover cover, but also because the machine because he could not be damaged his production, so the company's the activities were limited by some of the company's activities, and thus affected by some of the last year, because there is also some of the cost of the next year, because there is also has also a lot of the cost of the cost of the following a lot of the loss of the loss of the same cost of the loss of the next year, because there is also has also has also a total loss of 5, because we have a lot of the loss of the next year, because there is also a lot of the loss of the loss of the next year, and we have no more than the total loss of the total loss of 5, because there is also a new revenue of the loss of 5, because there is also a lot of 5, because there is also has not a new revenue, because we have a lot of 5, because there is also a lot of the next year, because there is also a new revenue, because there is also a lot of the loss of the total loss of the next year.

# Connar Box 2025 Law says transcription. The source is an impact of a fire loss in a 228 event. I want to merge the cash flow statement, and I think this part I would like you to take a look at first.

The second is our product of the wet towel category, he accounted for about 21%. We can see a situation of the entire dividend distribution in 2014, we issued a 2023 dividend, we are in the distribution of 0.3 per share. That 2024 we passed the board announcement in February last month, the board of directors decided that because it is a loss, then but also want to cooperate with the company's stable dividend policy, so we decided that the dividend distribution is 0.2. That part, in fact, compared to the dividend distribution of last year, he has become more and more stable.

I want to talk about a future strategy of the entire company. I want to talk about the future of the company. The first part of optimizing the overall operating costs, I think the company has done a comparison over the years to optimize the cost, we have plans to do some of our current production bases to be able to do a unified action, and then the entire management performance and production performance can be improved. The second part is the new product and new technology, especially in the non-participatory part, because we just mentioned that we have a part of the material, so let the whole of the company from a future market, we will have a field of industrial materials.

This is the second part of the whole limited and green products, because the non-partial part of the company in the future will be more environmentally conscious, the company will be more inclined to the whole raw materials, the choice is more environmentally friendly, such as we can decomposition of this part of the market, even in a green material, we choose our own materials can let us in the whole green energy ratio, we will be more and more. So this is the next part of the product in the future of the promotion of a project in the whole product is an analysis of a very important project. The relative development of the new market and the new business part of the extension of these so-called high-level functional parts of the market, we will be in addition to the original uncut market, we will start to refer to the newly mentioned clothing, or even an electronic insertion of such field, and then began to the layout action.

ESG is a trend in recent years, especially in recent years, and even in the future, because of the fact that there is a lot of commitment in this connar box. Like the part of corporate governance, or the establishment of a sustainable office, and then to promote all the demands of the sustainable environment, even in a risk management issue within the company has set up a public risk office to address the future of connar box a change in the future, and then to do something appropriate.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Investment advanced, if you have any questions, you can open the microphone directly to ask a question or play in the chat room. First, Mr. Chen mentioned a few questions. The first one is the largest product growth this year? Is there a target that does not pay sales this year? For example, is there a 1% share of revenue?

The second question is whether there is room for improvement in capital expenditure combined gross profit margins throughout the year? I think, here I have answered this before. In 2025, I think you should ask 2025, in the target of our business in 2025, I would like to talk about such products as hygiene supplies, because he is a relatively large base, so in terms of the amount of growth, of course, this section we have set a relatively large target here.

Although the second half of his business period may be only a period of two quarters, this part of the importance of connar boxes is also very important. Of course, it may not be the largest proportion of the whole number, but he is definitely different from the past, he is a new material, so in fact, he will have a relatively large proportion of a goal.

In fact, in 2025, the whole operation management, whether in business expansion or cost, we have introduced a lot of projects in the last year, but also a number of new results to customers to come to the company. So in 2025, we expect these mergers, whether they are good performance or gross profit structure, are some of the goals of the improvement compared to 2024. This is a response to Mr. Chen's question here. Is there any other question?

Thank you all for your support.
