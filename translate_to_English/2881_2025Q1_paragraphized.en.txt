Fubon Financial Holdings has announced the distribution of 24 years of its board of directors, including cash incentive of $4.25 and stock incentive of $0.25. In the first quarter of its performance, the net profit after our first quarter was 41.600 million, an increase of 35% year-on-year. The asset portion also reached more than 12 trillion, an increase of 5.2% year-on-year, with net worth exceeding 90 billion. The net profit after Fubon Life is 273.200 million and is the industry's number one priority.

FIP is the second premium market and FIP is the first in the market, with a return on investment of 5.41%. In the performance of capital, RBC is more than 400%, with 428%. The operating performance of the first quarter of Northfield is also very bright, the net profit after tax is exceeded 10 billion, which is a new high in history, mainly from net interest income NII year-on-year increase of more than 10 percent, and the handling fee is also 19%.

In April of this year, we have published a performance, which is the same as maintaining market leadership, EPS reached 3.1%. Page 7 shows the growth of various subsidiaries, from life, wealth, property insurance, and overseas banks in Fubon, Hong Kong Fubon and Huayi, as well as year-on-year growth, securities are mainly affected by the market, which is a year-on-year decrease. The next part of the asset is more than 12 trillion, an increase of 5.2% year-on-year, while the net worth is 2% year-on-year.

In terms of premium income, the growth of the entire FIP is over 23%, and the total premium is also 11%. In the market rankings, both the FIP and the annual RP and the total premium are the second in the industry, and if the FIP excludes the investment premium, the market is the first.

In addition, there is a significant increase in the contribution of foreign currency policy, which has reached 53%, mainly the contribution of the US dollar dividend policy. Page 14 changes from FIPE and VNB, FIP contribution by installments has also increased further by 28%, the proportion of FIP to FIP has also increased further to 49%, so in VNB growth can see a 9.9% annual growth.

On the other hand, in the BNP Paribas channel, we can see that in the FIPE section, there is basically a positive growth, especially in the business channel, there is a relatively significant 34% growth in the year. The 16 pages in the portfolio, the main changes, the first in the stock market, the proportion of domestic and foreign stock positions, the decline in the first quarter of this year, mainly reflected the volatility of the market, and the realization of capital gains. In addition, in the cash section, the most important investment or investment grade corporate bonds and financial bonds at the end of the first quarter can be seen at a relatively high level at 6.1%, and in the future we will continue to try to adjust the positions.

In addition, we can see the narrowing of the first quarter of Taiwan-American margin, so we can improve the cost of swapping, so the recurrence of the first quarter of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the last quarter has been optimized. In April, because of the trend of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence, we have taken a more positive recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the recurrence of the US dollar.

As a result of the above-mentioned amount of reports, the total amount of the total amount is about 2.7 billion, which can be used in May to cover foreign exchange-related exchange losses. Overall, negative-sold hedge management is a dynamic adjustment, taking into account the risks and costs of consideration, hoping to make the whole hedge cost stable long-term goal. In addition, we can also see the 20th page of the presentation, at the end of the first quarter at the end of the 25th quarter is 5. 41%, compared to the liability cost of 3. 14%, the average positive difference in the middle is about 2.27 percent compared to the same period last year. In addition to the recurrent yield after the second quarter of 24th quarter, from 2.1% rose to 2. 59%, compared to the second quarter of the end of the first quarter, we can see the positive difference.

In addition to the growth of 24 pages in the loan composition, the overall growth of 8.3% is mainly driven by 13.2% of the growth of individual loans. In this section of personal loans, you can further see that the growth of foreign currency is 9.7 percent, while the growth of foreign currency is 9.7 percent, while the growth of NT$14% is more than 38%. In 26 pages in personal credit, the annual growth rate of 11.9% is mainly driven by the growth of non-household mortgages, and other personal credit accounts is 37.4%.

The NIM is an annual increase of 2 BP in the first quarter, and the growth of the deposit spread is driven by 9 BP in the second quarter. This is mainly due to the increase in the interest rate of the dollar, but also offset the pressure of the financial asset yield due to the decrease in the U.S. dollar. If the change in the season, the NIM part has increased by 3 BP, and the deposit spread has also increased by 5 BP, mainly because of the increase in foreign currency survival rate. In 29 pages in the asset quality of the asset, the whole line maintains a good precautionary ratio of 13% coverage is more than 1000%, the withdrawal fee is mainly in general withdrawals, as well as the return of gas cases. On 30 pages in the credit card, the amount has increased by 2%, mainly in the growth of the costco card and overseas consumption, which also offset the growth of domestic consumption.

Please note: ** Please note: ** Please note: ** Please note: ** Please note:**

[1231. 48-1235. 48] and the overall non-economic assumptions. [1235. 48-1239. 48] is mainly the effect of adjusting the withdrawal rate higher than expected. [1239. 48-1243. 48] is similar to the overall conditions in the insurance market. [1243. 48-1247. 48] and earlier claims for health products.

[1247. 48-1253. 48] This effect of the part of the withdrawal is roughly negative 20 billion. [1253. 48-1257. 48] The claim-related approximately 15 billion. [1258. 48-1263. 48] The value of the new contract in 2024 is not limited to the total capital cost of 30 billion. [1263. 48-1268. 48] The analysis of the value of the new contract increased by 16.5% in 2024. [1272. 48-1276. 48]

[1276. 48-1280. 48] Y on Y on Y grew 18.7% under Base VNB. [1280. 48-1284. 48] reflects an increase in yield and a rise in foreign currency policy share. [1284. 48-1288. 48] has a positive effect on economic assumptions. [1288. 48-1291. 48] Because foreign currency policy typically has a higher rate of return. [1291. 48-1295. 48] In 2023, the foreign currency share of non-investment products increased to about 51% by 2024.

[1298. 48-1301. 48] also contributes to the effect of this economic hypothesis. [1301. 48-1304. 48] VNB has increased by 2.7% overall. [1304. 48-1307. 48] The actuarial hypothesis has a positive contribution mainly reflected. [1307. 48-1311. 48] The claims for health products sold in recent years are better. [1311. 48-1317. 48] The value of the new contract in 2024 increased by 28. 7% from the previous year. [1317. 48-1323. 48] Page 44 summarizes the economic hypothesis for 2023 and 2024.

[1323. 48-1328. 48] Page 45 compares to page 46 to the effective contract return for two years. [1328. 48-1330. 48] and the new contract return on investment. [1330. 48-1334. 48] Overall return on investment is assumed to be higher than last year. [1334. 48-1336. 48] is mainly benefiting from the rise in interest rates in Taiwan and the US. [1336. 48-1339. 48] is only the first year return on the NT New Contract. [1339. 48-1344. 48] The higher risk-off costs in the beginning will be a few drop.

[1344. 48-1347. 48] But the long-term risk avoidance costs or long-term return on investment hypotheses. [1347. 48-1350. 48] maintains last year's level. [1350. 48-1352. 48] The 47-page linearity section. [1352. 48-1356. 48] Calculates the equivalent ratio of VIP or VNB in 2024. [1356. 48-1358. 48] is lower than 9%. [1358. 48-1353. 48] So we maintain the 9% foldable hypothesis for 2023.

[1363. 48-1366. 48] Page 48 is the basis of capital costs. [1366. 48-1370. 48] Based on the RDC regulations of 2024. [1370. 48-1373. 48] The 49th and 50th pages are sensitivity analysis. [1373. 48-1375. 48] The 51st to 58th pages are the results of Deloy actuarial advisory firm load. [1380. 48-1381. 48] Overall.

[1381. 48-1386. 48] Fubon Life implied value calculation and related model actuarial assumptions are reasonable. [13886. 48-1388. 48] Comply with the relevant criteria. [1389.148-1395. 48] Next, enter the Q&A stage. [1395.1 48-1399. 48] The supervisor of the questions answered by Fubon Financial Holdings and the Guardian General Manager. [1399.148-1404.1 48]

[1404. 48-1407. 48] Senior cooperation with the Ministry of Natural Relations Wang Jiahui. [1407. 48-1410. 48] General Manager Guo Beting of Taipei Fubon Bank. [1410. 48-1411. 48] Vice President Jenny Lin. [1411. 48-1415. 48] Executive Vice President of the Fubon Life Actuarial Services Office. [1415. 48-1417. 48] Senior Vice President of Xu Yunjin. [1417. 48-1419. 48] Senior Vice President of Wang Wei.

[1419. 48-1422. 48] I have self-planning department included Lin's senior cooperation. [1422. 48-1427. 48] Please remember to enter the name of the organization in this online text question. [1427. 48-1430. 48] We will reply in a unified manner. [1430. 48-1435. 48] Please search your name and information online in Q&A. [1435. 48-1437. 48] and ask. [1437. 48-1442. 48] If you want to answer English, please leave a message.

[1443. 48-1445. 48] [1445. 48-1447. 48] Thank you. [1447. 48-1450. 48] This has it. [1450. 48-1456. 48] I have a lot of questions about this advanced question online. [1456. 48-1463. 48] I would like to first answer the questions related to financial control and overseas subsidiaries. [1463. 48-1447. 48] Then we should ask the bank again.

[1467. 48-1471. 48] Life also has our manager of this investment management. [1471. 48-1475. 48] Answer all your questions in order. [1475. 48-1477. 48] First of all, this is the first. [1477. 48-1480. 48] This is the most advanced question we have. [1480. 48-1478. 48] This is the current one. [1483. 48-1478. 48] This is the encouragement we have paid for this plan.

[1487. 48-1492. 48] We are currently in the process of being audited by the competent authority. [1492. 48-1498. 48] We do not currently have this change in our plan to encourage this policy. [1508. 48-1510. 48] There is another one here. [1512. 48-1516. 48] I also answer this question from a number of overseas subsidiaries.

[1516. 48-1518. 48] This is advanced. [1518. 48-1523. 48] Ask a question about the Chinese and the quality of the assets in Hong Kong. [1523. 48-1528. 48] This is actually the case. [1528. 48-1534. 48] We do not mean that the current quality of the assets in Hong Kong and in China will be quite stable. [1534. 48-1542. 48] We do not say that this normal BAU operation will have this withdrawal. [1542. 48-1547. 48] There is no expectation that there will be a large other whole.

[1547. 48-1555. 48] Of course, we know that the economy of this continent is relatively stable at the moment. [1555. 48-1559. 48] But the real estate is still a little pressure. [1559. 48-1564. 48] But we have very little exposure to real estate. [1564. 48-1566. 48] The developer's exposure is very small. [1566. 48-1568. 48] Almost nothing. [1568. 48-1572. 48] This LTV about mortgage.

[1572. 48-1576. 48] This ratio is very low. [1576. 48-1578. 48] This is below 50%. [1578. 48-1581. 48] We went to Silver Hong Kong last year. [1581. 48-1578. 48] There were a number of larger legal money amounts for this undesirable loan. [1587. 48-1596. 48] This is also actively involved in negotiating with clients about this guarantee. [1596. 48-1605. 48] The review of the quality of the current asset is not of this significant asset.

[1605. 48-1608. 48] So now is also relatively stable. [1618. 48-1627. 48] Here is the advanced mention that this Ray card will balance to bond bank China. [1627. 48-1632. 48] This is true that all banks around the world operate similarly. [1632. 48-1636. 48] Very few banks will benefit from this Ray card. [1636. 48-1645. 48] This first dose of this depositary spread has a significant adjustment. [1645. 48-1650. 48] This is of course, the enhancement is mainly structural changes.

[1650. 48-1655. 48] The first one is to reduce our deposit costs. [1655. 48-1659. 48] is to reduce the proportion of deposits in this dollar. [1659. 48-1661. 48] Increase the proportion of deposits in the RMB. [1661 48-1668. 48] It is important to understand that the spread of the current U.S. dollar and RMB deposits is very large. [1668. 48-1672. 48] This can greatly reduce our deposit. [1672.1678. 48] The other point is that we have been in the past year.

[1678. 48-1686. 48] This ratio is the ratio of the fiat money to the fiat money. [1686. 48-1688. 48] There is also a considerable increase in this increase. [1688. 48-1699. 48] On the one hand, we buy some of these assets with this ASRock. [1699. 48-1703. 48] also helped us to make some of this adjustment. [1703. 48-1711. 48] So in this aspect, the adjustment rate of the fiat money structure has been increased. [1712. 48-1714. 48] This cost has decreased.

[1714. 48-1721. 48] So this whole is equivalent to a significant improvement in the spread. [1721. 48-1727. 48] But of course, this spread will continue to change in this structure. [1727. 48-1733. 48] But in general, it is not easy for banks to derive benefits from this lower interest rate environment. [1733. 48-1735. 48] There is a special benefit. [1735. 48-1744. 48] There is a good look. [1752. 48-1758. 48] There is also an advanced question as to the direction of our money-controlled buying.

[1778. 48-1760. 48] The future of buying direction. [1760. 48-1763. 48] I don't think this has changed anything. [1763. 48-1771. 48] Because this insurance company is going to join the IFRS 17 next year with this ICS. [1771. 48-1776. 48] It's more about doing this. [1776. 48-1778. 48] It's probably not priority. [1778. 48-1785. 48] The other bank securities or other financial fields.

[1785. 48-1791. 48] I think that as long as we are able to expand this scale of our operation. [1791. 48-1797. 48] We will evaluate this interest of the shareholders. [1804. 48-1810. 48] Well, it is probably the question that I have about this overseas subsidiary and fintech. [1810. 48-1817. 48] Next, I will ask this question from Kuo Kuo of Beifu Bank. [1817. 48-1819. 48] I will report this to you. [1819. 48-1823. 48] There are some investment advances that have asked this NIN related questions.

[1823. 48-1825. 48] I started to answer this question. [1825. 48-1830. 48] The first quarter of NIN was 1. 16 in the presentation I just saw. [1830. 48-1834. 48] This adjustment contained a brush ratio of about 1.3 per cent. [1834. 48-1837. 48] It was similar to the first quarter of last year. [1837. 48-1844. 48] The outlook for NIN was about this improvement about the low to mid single digital. [1844. 48-1846. 48] The current PASS.

[1846. 48-1850. 48] Adjust the structure of these storage ports that we have followed. [1850. 48-1852. 48] I think that this is the same goal. [1852. 48-1857. 48] Also goes to this addition to improvement to sell money. [1858. 48-1870. 48] There is also an investment advanced to mention a topic on the growth of Nutri-Fund and Banker-Sholom for the first quarter of this year. [1870. 48-1875. 48] Then you have to start with insurance business.

In the past two years, it has been very obvious that this trend of this kind of maintenance combined trust is in our course. Therefore, in the second half of these two years, the whole investment market is also relatively unknown, which may be very different from the bond market, or the equilibrium link of this structure of goods may be accepted by the market, but the demand for this fund should also be seen in the next two years. This is not the case, only billions of dollars, after the volatility of this April, there is no loss of customers, but also the situation of this monogram is also very smooth, so there is no credit loss, so we ask the life of this act and this commodity to answer, OK, then I first replied to the question about value, one of the questions is that this VIF and VNB changes the assumptions, why VIF is a negative impact, VNB is a positive effect, VNB is just the right effect we have just mentioned here is that the proportion of foreign currency policy is more obvious, because we are mainly the U.S. dollars, the return on U. dollars in 2024, so the economic assumptions in VNB is a positive input, because we have a negative input input for the year of the year of the policy, and we have a negative negative return on this year of this policy.

The following is the paragraph type transcript you requested:. At the end of May there is almost no such level. Of course, after falling NIKI Position after that, we can see that the impact of our exchange rate fluctuations on our water benefits will be significantly reduced. Of course, if the USD continues to depreciate the currency in the future, we will continue to use Prosy's hedge.

In addition, we are also reducing the impact of the exchange rate on our water-benefit, so we have mentioned earlier that we have already volunteered a total of 10 billion reserves, which is how the new foreign exchange reserves have been used to operate. The next step is to talk about the outlook on the cost of safekeeping. We have been managing our total safekeeping costs for most of our time in the long run between 100 and 150 BPs, with an average of 10 years to look at our safekeeping costs for 90 BPs. Although the short-term exchange rate fluctuations in the second quarter of this year are relatively large, we will continue to work to manage them in the ranges of 100 to 150 BPs.

The US dollar is the most important reserve currency in the world, the US is the world's largest economy, its supply and demand is still quite stable and liquidity is the best. Basically, we will not be affected by the adjustment of sexuality.

Therefore, we expect that the proportion of our investments will not be adjusted too much. For the time being, our investment targets are still the main investment targets of the world's largest companies. There are a few minor questions that come to mind as to how much we have not yet achieved in our stocks.

There is also a question about the proportion of Taiwan dollar base EGF, this place is about 8% of AUM, which is the same as the quarter. Another question is whether the alternative currency is shown in the PyChart, in fact, is not correct in the Prosy, which is what the 1.9% of the chart above. Also, there is a question about the proportion of Taiwan dollar policy to the EQ is about 31%.

The balance of this 2.7 billion foreign exchange price change reserve has been adopted since the end of May, because the exchange rate is quite volatile, especially in the month of May, so it is currently zero. However, due to the new system, we will in the future according to this new rule, that is to do 100% of this quotation or the effect of this shock.

Another thing I missed was to ask what the alternative currency is in PyChart. It is actually a mistake in Prosy, which is 1.9% of the chart above. Also, it is about 31% when it comes to the EQ. I have to say that my investment corrects the fact that I may have been wrong, and the ratio of foreign currency policies is 31% where I correct the car.

There is also a question missing from the question of why the cost of foreign exchange and the disadvantages of foreign exchange is why the cost of the same period last year will fall so much from 102 to 87 pp. That is, from the same period last year was the same period of 2024 was 198 pp, but now it has fallen to 116 pp.

Thank you.
