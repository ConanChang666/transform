<think> Ok, I need to sort out the verbatim transcripts provided by the user into paragraph format. First, I need to read everything carefully to make sure that no word is missing. The user specifically emphasizes that nothing must be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the original intention and structure must be kept strictly.

First, I will deal with each sentence in the order of timestamp, but need to be in a reasonable section according to the context. For example, a greeting at the beginning and a meeting introduction may form a paragraph, followed by a portion of the financial data and business performance, and each subsidiary's situation may be separate. It should be noted that there may be a time difference between some sentences, but the actual content is continuous, such as the introduction of the meeting supervisor part, which needs to be arranged in order.

In addition, there are some places in the original text that may type wrong words, such as "competition", "prostitutional fish" and other words, but the user requests do not rewrite, so it must be kept the same. Although it may affect reading, but it must be handled according to the user's instructions. During the finishing process, I will check every sentence in a sentence to ensure that paragraphs are correctly inserted and remain logically coherent. For example, the information of the host and the meeting supervisors are concentrated in a paragraph, the following financial data and subsidiary performance description, each topic is separated for easy reading.

In short, it is important to maintain the integrity of the original sentence, and at the same time combine the relevant sentences into a reasonable paragraph, making the whole content easier to read, but not to change any original information. </think>: Afternoon An.

This year, we have a decline in the soil market economy, as well as a decrease in our own investment income, resulting in a greater loss of income than last year. But after this year, we have the opportunity to make some copies of the allocated goods, and our bond losses will decrease from last year, so for this year's profit, we should only have the opportunity to exceed last year's profit, as described above.

The bank's current mortgage balance is around 8000 billion yuan, and the mortgage interest rate range is probably from 2.6%. The situation is actually because of the large number of cases, the length of the review period. On the whole mortgage market's outlook, because the bank's current mortgage market is mainly based on the acquisition, we can lightly and confidently increase the project's capacity, and look forward to 114 years of mortgage business impact, but the impact is relatively limited.

The future of U.S. bonds is subject to significant fluctuations in U.S. direct debt rates, and our bank's investment in U.S. bonds is mainly based on a allocation of foreign interest funds, including public debt, financial debt, and corporate debt. Investing in U.S. bonds is mainly based on long-term holdings, and of course, if there is a space for capital gains, we will sell it in a timely manner. Although the U.S. Treasury debt is subject to the purpose of degradation, it is still a high-quality liquidity asset that facilitates the bank's liquidity coverage, and we will also operate in a trend.

A recent trend in the market interest rate is to present a high-grade boom pattern, we will timely be the bank's capital situation to adjust the bond operation strategy, above. Online media friends asked, the following four questions: First, the stock market outlook and the investment strategy; Second, the deposit significantly increased by hundreds of billions; Third, whether the Treasury Life will continue to apply to the competent authority for cash encouragement; Fourth, the current mortgage control and drainage situation. Well, thank you for asking for these four questions, I will explain by different departments. First, I asked Chen to explain, the second part of the deposit, I asked the business development department to again, and the third question is about life, we ask the general manager of Blue to explain, these four questions, or all levels of the financial cooperation, above. Thank you for the media questions, because the outlook on the stock market.

Recently, it has been said that after Jinhua will cancel the vacancy, the capital movement of the stock market can be enhanced, so in comparison to say that there is a buffer period, so the performance of the company is resilient, so although it is a shock, but we do not see the direction of bad stock market.

In addition, it may be that the market estimate is likely to start to lower interest rates in the fourth quarter, and the interest rate is about two digit, then we will still look at our bank's funds to take a batch layout, if there is a reduction in interest rate, there is a capital benefit, we will also sell to achieve capital gains, above. The official fixed deposit significantly increases the adjustment structure of the city, and the exchange department replies: in the future, we will use various base measures to guide branches, economic expansion, active weight management as the main business, to reduce the cost of funds and adjust the structure of the living deposit, the above report.

These three questions are relatively close to the Finance Department, and we ask the Finance Department's Chen's agreement. Thank you for asking the investor, the bank's part, to the overseas bond ratio, the bank's part, the foreign currency bond ratio is in our overall investment position.

This is a foreign currency bond, which accounts for 11.66% of the bond and the ratio of the bond to the corporate bond. The overall procedure for foreign bonds is about 2.23 years, the risk-saving ratio is up to 90%, and the risk-saving ratio is up to 90%. [paragraph 2] It seems like the life part should be asked, the bank is mainly a configuration of over-the-counter funds, so we will match the fixed interest rate with the floating rate.

We then use a way to control interest rate risk during the control process. This is more than that. [paragraph 3] He just had to hear the report of the total life blocker, so he asked that there is no specific indication that life blocker is a 90% avoidance, which is partly to ask the life blocker to explain.

[paragraph 4]. The life-saving ratio is currently 90%, and is mostly traditional, so we are going to do it by the way. The above report. [paragraph 5] Now ask our Chief Economist, Dr. Xu Xianting, and there are not a few friends to ask. Now Trump is the keyword of the global economy, so the global economy is mostly about the direction of Trump's policy.

Now it is a global point of view. [para.6] Because we know that since the release date announced in early April, it will be suspended for 90 days, and now everyone is still in the 90-day period of observation, so the current situation is still an uncertain, uncertain situation.

[Section 7]. The financial markets will also fluctuate with information about the U.S. policy. If the International Organization predicts that IMF will update the global economic outlook on April 22, its benchmark forecast is that the impact of the U.S. baseline tariffs on global economic growth is 0.5 percentage points, down from 3.3 to 2.8%, and next year is around 3%. [Section 8] The world's largest economy and the U.S. economy, IMF predicts that it will be reduced to 1.8% or less than 2%.

If the Fed's policies are linked, the Fed's response to the U.S. labor market has not yet shown any fatigue, so the Fed does not really believe that the current rate of interest has not yet been urgent. [paragraph 9] He will continue to observe the impact of tariffs on U.S. prices, so he is now taking a more sacred attitude to observe it. So it is likely that the first rate of interest will be cut in September or the fourth quarter of this year.

[Section 10]. Therefore, if this is likely to be affected by the corresponding tariff situation, especially in the industry, the gross profit margin is relatively low, and the U.S. export market is the main export market of these industries, so this will actually have been shipped in advance of this year. The situation of this pre-shipment situation has been slowing down. [Section 11] So in the second half of the year, it is necessary to be a bit more careful, if the worst case is the implementation of 32% tariffs, the economic industry rate of Taiwan will be less than 0. 4 to 0.6 percentage points, and the total of the total of the estimates will be reduced by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points. The latest forecast is to reduce Taiwan's growth this year to 2.91.

That is less than 3%. [para. 12] So in summary, this year Taiwan's economic growth rate should be kept more than 3%, it is still not light. This is probably the case. [para. 13] Well, we've all answered the questions online today, so today we're going to ask a paragraph, thank you for your enthusiastic participation.

The current question has been answered. [para. 14] At the end of the meeting today, the relevant information will be uploaded to the Investor Relations page of our website within one hour after the meeting. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
