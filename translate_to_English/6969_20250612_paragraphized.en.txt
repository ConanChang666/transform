Chengxin was established in 2019. In 2020, it was applied to enter. Liulin plant was built. In the same year, we introduced the CNS of ISO9001. The system of ISO was obtained.

In November 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance of SME Innovation Research Award. In December of the same year, the Zhongke plant started to clean up the land. In September 2022, the Taiwan Circular Economy Award for Agricultural Goods was awarded.

In 2023, we obtained a factory registration certificate. We started to apply for re-use of relevant licenses. In October, the Liuke plant was completed.

Conduct a survey. In July 2024, the Zhongke factory began production and manufacturing. In September, listed on the market innovation. Representation. The company's organizational structure. Under the shareholders meeting, there is the chairman of the board of directors.

Under the Audit Committee. Remuneration Committee. The Meeting Room is part of the Board of Directors. Under the General Manager's Room.

Below we have a few of the many advantages of innovation scratching. Liuke plant in the science and technology plant in the office of finance, and administration. Next. The core management team of five people. Chairman Chen Peng General Manager Xia Yamin.

Vice President Zhou Xinghui Chief Financial Officer Zhang Ziyi, as well. Director of Innovation and Development Wang Minglong. Next. Introduction of the company's operation covers the mine. Next. Business philosophy introduces the modern era of the gradual decomposition of natural mineral resources.

How the waste matrix replaces waste with natural mineral resources to waste. The waste is the Lord's. detto our Roundphone is full. business model. nehmer virtually Jimer production approach. przex downstream customers get orders by selling products.

Integrity is the role of upstream and downstream. We share sustainability with the supply chain. We pursue such a circular supply chain. It can protect our natural environment and slow down consumption. And then the development of a sustainable society. Next

The first thing we need to know is waste. Waste is useless. It's something you can want to do with de-incineration or landfill. Now we see red in the middle. It's a secondary or renewable resource.

We can have some valuable substances around our lives. We will collect classifications and hand them over to a specific area. We will burn them. The process of recycling is when we raise our hands to protect the environment. We already know that it is valuable. So these are obvious to see the secondary and renewable resources that have been identified.

We pick up this part of the waste that we can use. We see this picture now. It is invisible because it is animated. So the secondary resource development continues to the end. It will grow and get bigger. So later the waste will not be usable.

But in developing such a process. The initial definition of the second resource in this red. It is not so much red. There is a green circular economy process in the middle of red and black.

The red is still very small now. Many of our resources are still being disposed of as waste. To go to the powder lamp is also buried. Therefore, the integrity experiment is mainly doing green. The part that is now covered in this picture is now covered. There will be plenty of room for the circular economy in the future.

It is the area where renewable resources have some or nothing to waste. We will step by step expand the circular economy. Then maximize the secondary resources to red and black with a middle interface completely disappear.

The circular economy itself has a process that needs to be carefully filtered. Integrity experiments have a design logic in saying that the circular economy has a design. We call the circular economy 123. 123 is a step. A practice from waste to resources.

The first step is to take a physical examination of the condition of the waste. Understand its value. What may be. After that, we will proceed to the product market based on these values.

The first action is to find the product market. That product market is looking for and the customer's initial evaluation at the same time. It is defined as a unit price. For example, it is a unit price of 10 pieces.

Let's look at 10 acceptable costs. Let's assume it is 5 or 6 pieces. What we're looking for next is step 3. How to control the cost of this redesign's machining path.

The process of processing or the middle section of the product at a reasonable cost. This can be ensured. put in. waste. passed. price positioning of the target product.

Acceptable processing costs. Ensuring the entire economy is profitable. That redesign lasts. It may be that we have to pad. Its manufacturing process is a lack of in the past. We have a blank gap to pad.

Or its waste must be standardized. It cannot be mixed with other things, as well as for the user to use. There is no use for the customer. Specifications must be specified.

Prevent him from being unable to use it. Then there is the creation of sales channels as well. Over-the-counter processing. Partially. From A waste is processed to B customers. Next.

Next.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcriptions and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any of the original text, so it is necessary to keep them sentence-by-word while organizing them into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I read the entire transcript and understand the overall content and structure. It looks like a presentation or report on the company's products, technology applications, and sustainability strategies. The content involves topics such as semiconductor manufacturing, waste disposal, recycled materials, and circular economy. The transcripts provided by the users are divided into sentences marked with multiple timestamps, each with a timeframe, but the user wants to remove the timestamp, keep only the content, and organize them into natural paragraphs. Next, I need to figure out how to combine these separate sentences into paragraphs. The key lies in identifying logical relationships between sentences, such as topic transitions, the beginning of new topics, etc.

For example, when a "next" appears, it may indicate the end of a paragraph and the beginning of a new paragraph. In addition, some sentences may belong to the same topic and need to be linked together, while other sentences may involve different topics and need to be handled separately. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the user mentioned "do not delete any one sentence", so it is necessary to ensure that all sentences are included in the sequence, and at the same time, to avoid adding any interpretations or modifications to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the original text. For example, technical terms in the original, such as "CMP sludge dispenser", "carbon lotion" and so need to be preserved in the same way, without simplifying or replacing.

In addition, there are some possible typographical errors or formatting problems in the transcripts provided by the user, such as "[1332. 20-1337. 20] The whole product comes from recycled materials" whether the "from" is correct, or "[1536. 20-1538. 20] 13. 7. The numbers in the "Change Policy" are correct. However, according to the user's request, no modifications can be made, so it is necessary to keep the original. When organizing paragraphs, I will look for the natural pause point, for example, when referring to "Next", usually indicates the end of a paragraph.

In addition, when subject conversion, such as turning from introducing a product to a market position, segmentation is also required. For example, after the "[1484. 20-1487. 20] industry profile and market position", the next content may be a new paragraph. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to some sentences that may belong to the same technical process or concept, and need to be arranged together. For example, about carbon emulsion products, from "carbon emulsion products with charcoal" to "make special specifications like carbon emulsion", these sentences should be linked together to form a complete paragraph.

At the same time, check the format is correct, no markdown, and maintain the plain text format. </think> It is on the condenser, the pursuit of indicators, hope that the situation has been improved, the semiconductor plant is built in the investment country, we will also copy the CMP sludge condenser manufacturing technology to the overseas, along with the condenser factory in its overseas investment layout, we also expand the overseas layout of our condenser technology.

In addition to this, due to the needs of clean air, there will be a lot of adsorption materials of activated carbon, such as activated carbon filter, aluminum packaging and filter, are small business accessories. These accessories, are currently mainly decomposed into a furnace, in the panel packaging, or wafer belting, their sustainable goal is to pursue a zero-emission situation, decomposition furnace is expected to be limited, and less and less.

Next. There are five products and one consulting service, we make a comparison table. Investment advanced if there are problems with the source of the materials, and the other where the resulting recycled products are located, we will proceed to a comparison table and then proceed, these questions can be compared by reference table. Next, the whole product comes from recycled materials, using a carbon-formed waste gas, to achieve the whole product of the material flow, to introduce the molding characteristics.

The UN Sustainable Development Goal is STGS, in the 12th responsible production and consumption cycle, we focus on the so-called zero waste industrial cycle, the waste turned into raw materials, processed and manufactured into product sales to customers, the part of the responsible extension of the green process chain, so that we can make our raw materials forever, and also through the process of such raw materials recycling asylum, we can reduce the destruction of nature, in 13.7. 6 changes in the strategy, 14. marine ecology, 15.

In the sun, there will be more than 1.28kg, per kilogram of carbon dioxide, per kilogram of material, is quite new, 25.4% of the sun's sunlight, its low carbon advantage is quite obvious. This kind of low-carbon material, supply to the cake factory, not only the plastic factory is close to adoption, its sourcing policy for carbon reduction is very clear, and this packaging adhesive can be used directly on the IC chip, supply to the next round, such as the phone or computer manufacturer, so the carbon reduction can go directly to the product. This carbon reduction is an important policy in line with the requirements of the packaging manufacturer, so our product advantage is that we recycle, as a positive manufacturing process, and then can be integrated with the original packaging material.

In 2020, we signed a new factory with the packaging plant. In 2021, we applied for a re-use permit. In 2022, we developed a re-use silica re-use as a de-molder with the de-molder factory and supplied it to the packaging plant. In 2024, we approved increments to items that can be covered by the packaging plant in Taiwan. In 2025, we and the packaging plant and the packaging material factory, cake factory and integrity will have a common verification process such as green packaging biscuit, and we expect to be able to implement the packaging in 2027. Next

This is a plastic re-use spherical silica, its product microscope with good material properties, it has been the initial verification of the plastic material factory, and now the verified cookies are sent to the packaging factory for on-line verification. If this is done, the packaging factory in Taiwan is estimated to have a year 3000 to 5000 tons of waste rubber, and can be recycled through such a large number of recycling, reducing incineration, so that our environment more sustainable and more environmentally friendly.

Next. This is the China Gold Medal, followed by the Corporate Awards, as well as the Cross-Border Field Awards. Next. Financial Information. Next. In 2021, our combined revenue ranged from more than 99 million in 2021 to 200 million in 2024.

In 2025, Q1, as the revenue of CSIC increases, Q1 is about 7.5 million in 2025. Next, we have been increasing our debt ratio from 2021 to 2024, mainly by 2023. In 2024, our debt ratio is about 72.0 05%. The following financial figures are for companies to read the reference. Next

In terms of research and development energy and future development plans. Next. In terms of research and development energy, integrity industry has done a lot of innovative development in the field of waste recycling, and introduced to production practices. We have also applied for grants throughout the development process, because the case itself is valuable, we have received two SBIRs involved in the municipality, AI land program of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a larger production and creative platform program, which has been approved and executed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

In terms of the number of patents, our patents have been converted to patents in the past two years in 2023, with 22 patents and 19 patents, with nearly 60 patents on the list of patents approved and filed. Next, there are three major projects in future development. A is the CMP-Uni recycling technology application replication program. CMP-Uni is the research simulation of wafer foundry, and we have created the world's first CMP-Uni recycling project after CMP-Uni's resource recovery.

This part follows the layout of the wafer foundry, and we follow the replication and layout to go overseas. Then item B is the value application development plan for spherical CO2 products. This project is currently applied to the industry innovation platform program, which is an innovative development value program from the packaging reef back to the cradle to the cradle. This project is due to the cooperation with the packaging plant and the plastic material factory, which is very important for our future development by 2027.

Our company for this kind of recycling technology, we cooperate with Japan, and by importing the equipment that has been relatively matured in Japan, we can prepare the solar panel ideal recycling of the following five products: solid fuel, such as mineral aluminum, wiring and recycling of copper metal, the wire, there is a more metal recycling, the complete glass recycling into new building materials glass, plastic backplate part of the detoxification, or powdered furnace disposal, the part of the electromagnetic sheet is silicon, made of steel sheet auxiliary materials. The most innovative thing is to prepare the whole solar panel to occupy about 700 million dollars, which is 70% of the material of solar panels, the amount of glass. Next we introduce the glass to the integrity of the next page. This is the project with the Japanese equipment, can see the glass is very transparent, and the strength can be complete, we import the equipment after the company.

Two glass composite patent for integration. A large number of backplates can be made. Glass plate inside. Keep the strength of the glass plate. With its transparency. Re-combined into glass composite products.

It is also similar to wood. Glass composite products. So we can see. Glass composite products. Can be at the bottom of this glass.

Can be in this glass. At the bottom of the glass. At the bottom of the glass. At the bottom of the glass. At the bottom of the glass.

With its transparency. Re-combined into glass composite products. It is also similar to wood. Or the glass is soundproofed. Such products. The recycled glass has complete.

Completeness Cleanness. It is possible. The structure of it is preserved in a relatively high. After such a glass recycling, it can be imported into the glass production.

We see. That's what agriculture needs. Plant factory. Green factory this piece. Agricultural materials side. Glass on the back.

Because the number of backboards is very large. The proportion of its glass. The proportion of its quality is 70%. The quality of the glass. The source of its glass is sufficient. If you put a large number of photoelectric backboards.

After reasonable recycling technology. Processed and recycled glass. Become a glass plate building materials. Such a large amount of low cost. Have a competitive advantage. Also low carbon glass building materials.

It is possible to introduce the use of agriculture. We think now. Such a tumbling cycle. It will lead to the glass greenhouse building materials. On the other hand, it gives full play to the transparency of glass building materials.

The structural strength of the material's sheet. Then it turns it into a glass greenhouse. Generally speaking, we are now intelligent agriculture.

Temperature and humidity fertilizer. Or growth cycle. Then go under a good imported environment. Able to develop. High yield high quality and stable. Agricultural products of smart agriculture.

So how to put waste plate. Applied to the building materials of the glass greenhouse. It is the whole of it can be recycled.

The next page is a plant factory. It has been imported in Changhua. That is also in the international. The Netherlands for the plant factory or greenhouse.

It is also a lot of promotion. To combine the AI machine implementation of smart agriculture. Next. The future of waste power boards has a large recycling business opportunity. We think the future of waste power boards is a potential business opportunity.

That is, all the resources of the waste plate. Both contain glass and wire battery surface junction boxes. They can all be in the local factory. It becomes a product resource.

We will follow the introduction of patents. We will work strategically with glass processing plants. In the future, we will introduce low-carbon building materials. We will meet the needs of the future city.

This is a great way to develop. This is part of the future development of Chengxin company. It is one of the most important highlights. Next. The above is the business development brief of Chengxin company.

Thanks to all the investors for listening, thank you very much.
