Good evening to all of you who have invested in advanced media. We welcome you to participate in the corporate briefing session of Cathay Financial Holdings in the second quarter of 2025. I am Mr. Chen, CFO, and I am glad to report today.

First, let's look back at the first half of 2025. Cathay Pacific Bank's net profit rose again with a record high of 16% year-on-year, a double-digit increase of 15% year-on-year net profit, a 28% year-on-year increase of 28% net first-year growth in financial management and the first-year growth of credit cards were 34% and 16% respectively.

In addition, Cathay Securities continues to promote a full range of digital operations, clients have reached 2.3 million households, with more than 20% of the business share entrusted to maintain the industry's first. Here on the fifth page, we want highlight Cathay Genetics, in addition to its steady performance in operation, and continue to expand our sustainable impact. This is the ninth year in a row, which brings together international climate experts and benchmark business leaders to share the sustainable outlook and industry practices. This year, more than 5000 people attended this year, the last salary of the company accounted for 80% of the stock market value.

In the first half of the year, the ROE of financial holdings was 10.9%, and the ROE of the bank's securities was excellent. The eighth page here in terms of net value, affected by the decline in the value of financial assets, the net value of financial holdings was 781.4 billion, and the net value of the common stock was 45.9 yuan. Next, we saw that in July, the bank was allowed to set up a Tokyo branch and Fukuoka's office, and the Chinese mainland China's premium sales in the first half of the year was 15% growth.

In terms of net profit margin, the cumulative net profit margin is 1. 56%, and the deposit margin is 1. 86%, which is higher than the same period last year, the main benefit of the deposit structure adjustment and foreign currency capital costs due to lower interest rates. We look at this second quarter of QOQ's single-quarter analysis below, net profit margin and deposit margin are further improved from the previous quarter. The next page we see that in terms of asset quality, is to maintain good quality, as of the first half of the deposit ratio is 0.14%, the deposit coverage ratio is 1200%, the first half of the deposit is 3.2 billion, the net profit after that net withdrawal is 2.3 billion, the conversion is 1.2 billion, and the conversion cost is 17 BP.

In terms of net revenue in the first half of the year, net income in the first half of the net income increased by 28%, then the main wealth management grew by more than 30% in the first year of the year, which is the increase in consumer spending at home and abroad, and the net income of credit cards grew by 16%. In the first half of the year, we further shared the contents of the first share, net income in the first half of the year, net income in the first half of the year was 11,2 billion, up 34%, of which the mutual fund annual growth was 35%, 53% of the number of customers and AEWM, which also provides a good foundation and energy for further growth in the future management business.

In terms of the value of the new contract, VNB in the first half of the year was 1.8 billion, an annual growth of 12%, which is mainly due to the substantial growth in the sales of traditional U.S. traditional and investment commodities. In addition, we look at 22 pages here, the liability cost is 3.84% at the end of the second quarter, which is an increase of 5 BP compared to the previous quarter. In addition to the impact of the increase in interest rate on interest-based commodities, we have made a specific commodity liability reserve interest rate in June compared to the adjustment of the life table.

<think> OK, the user wants me to edit a copy of the text in a paragraph-based readable format. First, I need to read the contents of the text carefully to ensure that the user understands each timestamp corresponding sentences and does not delete or rewrite anything. First, I will check the text by word-by-word to make sure that no sentences are missing. The user specifically emphasizes that the content cannot be deleted or modified, so it must be handled strictly according to the content after each timestamp. Next, I need to identify the correlation between the timestamps, combining the continuous sentences into a natural paragraph, while keeping the original timestamps and the content unchanged. For example, the beginning part:

[651. 44-656. 16] The domestic debt that includes the release of ETFs is 5.1%. After the sentence can be merged into the preceding sentence, it needs to be observed whether it belongs to the same topic. It looks like this part is part of the portfolio, followed by the bond part, followed by the overall yield data, so it may be necessary to segment each data point. At the same time, pay attention to the dialogue part, such as the question and answer need to be segmented to ensure that each question and answer are separate paragraphs.

However, according to user requirements, as long as you do not delete the content, you can merge the consecutive topics in accordance with the logic without having to strictly interrupt the time. In addition, the user mentions "not condensed any original content", so all the original words, including repeating and concluding words such as "that", "but", etc. For example, "that we just reported in the recurring revenue is higher than last year" need to be retained. During the processing process, also check whether there are timestamp errors, such as whether there are jump marks or duplicate cases, but according to the provided data, timestamps are incremental and no obvious errors.

For example, from the financial data section to the field question section, it needs to be clearly separated and may be separated by line or space. At the same time, keep speaking, because the original text is a speech or meeting record, and do not need to be changed to written. After the initial draft, read again, confirm that all sentences have been properly converted, and keep all content as requested by the user without omission or modification.

However, we have just reported that the recurrent income is rising from the same period last year. Next, we see that the recurrent yield was 3.41% before this hedge in the first half of the year, an increase of 11 BP compared to the same period last year, mainly in the interest rate high to see the bond, interest income continued to grow.

In the first half of the year, the annualized avoidance cost was 1. 45%, and the second quarter it increased by 11%. In the third quarter, it raised the risk ratio in advance, while applying the new reserve for foreign exchange price fluctuations to the reserve of the competent authority. The amount released was all deposited in this foreign exchange reserve to enhance the paradigm capabilities in response to foreign exchange fluctuations. The first half of the year, the risk avoidance cost is still within the target range.

Looking at the cost of the subsequent CS, under the circumstances of the cost cut, the opportunity to go down, is conducive to the operation and management of this safe cost. Then the next part of the dividend, the first half of the recognition of the cash dividend 8.5 billion, as of the end of July is recognized as the 1.4 billion, which is an increase of 3 billion compared to the same period last year.

In addition, we continue to grasp investment opportunities in fixed income areas, reducing the risk of diversifying investment areas. At present, the share of North America and Asia-Pacific markets is 52%, 18% and 18%. Next, we look at the first half of this year's net worth is 6,281, which decreases from the end of the year, mainly due to the substantial appreciation of the Taiwanese dollar and fluctuations in Taiwan stocks, resulting in unrealized net worth of financial assets. However, the net value ratio of the first half is still higher than 8%.

In the first half of this year, the premium income in the first half of this year reached 21 billion, which was 11% higher than the same period last year, and the market share was 13.5% the second largest. In the first half of the year, commercial insurance, including fire insurance, was very good performance, and the share of free channel increased to more than 52%. In the first half, nearly 50% of the premium income was sold by the group channel.

The above is today's report, and we are open to ask questions. We ask the general manager Lee and the spokesperson of the Womb. You are welcome to participate in the international monitoring of the 2020 second round of global conference. Just as you have reported by the Chief Financial Officer, we do not know if you have any questions, and we will accept the online QA first.

I don't want to say that all year round, I don't know whether there is any forecast here, and Taiwan's central bank may also have interest rate cuts, I don't know what the impact of this downturn on the hard. Then the second question is about life here, now if we already have a new situation, can't tell us what kind of situation this change is about sharehold equity? Then it's the second quarter so far, I don't know if our URC here has no return with Urcg, the current water level, and the double leverage ratio here in June has reached a 125 percent limit. I don't know if we're in the double leverage ratio, except for a depreciation or a rise in the stock market, there are no other ways that can be improved.

The last question was, then, that there was the Avraiz 17 connection before, and maybe the impact of the Performa sharehold equity was probably falling low to mid single digit, I don't know that at this point in time, we have no change in such a guidance. We now have to say that the profit in Swap is probably negative 5 basis points, overall, we feel the impact on NIM is limited. Just to mention that if the U.S. dollar rate decrease in the second half of the year, or the impact of the central bank's interest rate decrease on this side of the dollar, we have also made an assessment. Basically, our estimate of NIM is likely to be at 1. 55%. But if we do this sensitivity analysis, the U.S. dollar decrease is relatively limited to our NIM, about 0.1 percent.

However, we basically expect that this year's NIM will be roughly the same as last year. The first change to the exchange rate, right, is the impact of the net value before we probably, if only look at the net value, about 1%, that net value is less than the actual impact, about 0.1 percent. So the impact of the exchange rate is actually the entire net value ratio for us, in fact, we have remained above 8.5%, so it is very high. So the entire net value effect is very controllable, because we are now foreign reserves to yesterday, our foreign reserves actually exceeded the level of 56 billion at the end of June.

The unrealized portion of the bond is roughly equivalent to the figure at the end of June, which is probably the whole unrealistic situation at the moment. You just care about the double rate ratio at the end of June is 124.8%.

In fact, it is not even a decimal point or below 125% except for the fact that the first half of the year is stronger, the capital market is more volatile, and that the industry is the same situation. Every year we distribute dividends through the shareholders' meeting in June, there will be a double rate ratio to a relatively low point If we are in the part of the double rate ratio, the situation in July has dropped to 123%, of course, the future is also positive. In addition to the fact that you just said that the whole exchange rate is stable, the capital market is relatively stable, and the future is just as we mentioned in the report, the trend of lower interest rates, which is also conducive to our financial assets.

For these customers, we will continue to provide these assistance, etc. According to the Bank Association of these resolutions, we will provide customers with some necessary relief measures, and ask you not to ask if there is the first question here.

In the first half of the year, we have a 34% growth in the financial sector. This part of the story is what we are seeing all year round or the opportunity to achieve double-digit growth. But of course, this is a situation in the entire market. The three-tier ratio of foreign bonds is all the effect of the exchange rate on that.

In fact, before connecting, it is used as a way to implement our asset liability management. That is to say, we still focus on debt-to-balance assets to match some of the assets to the debt-to-balance end. So it is still the main source of our entire allocation with overseas fixed income assets.

Hello, thank you for your interest in Investco. I have two questions about insurance in Investco. The first is that the influence of FX after iOS 70 is that the influence of money comes mainly from these traditional coins. That can not give us an idea is if the interest rate in the United States goes down. How fast your money can return at low value.

The second problem is to assume that the short-term rate is a lot but the long-term rate is not. Can you give us an idea is how the overall financial impact of domestic sales in the case of the long-term or not with the short-term rate. Thank you. We also do short-term Taiwan SWAP is relatively short, so we are now about three months to six months in general, so basically three months in principle, if the market is expected to have a decline in the second half or September, then the actual repricing is very fast.

However, we already have some trends that reflect the overall interest rate. So when the interest rate goes down to a certain extent, the cost of the SWAP would be better if we felt it. Instead, we would pull it back for a long period of time and lock it in a comparison to the one we felt comfortable with and then for a longer period. Like we used to be cheaper at NDF, we would also lock some NDFs for a longer period of time.

It's still in the range of a swing, if this is the beginning of a downward trend for us, of course. Because it's a short-rate part, it's a downward trend, so it's seeing how much we're down, about three months later, the strategy with our current CS is about five percent. So, after that three months, it'll immediately react to that long repricing part of the day, if there's no fluctuation, it really doesn't affect our overall stable income.

The first thing you need to ask is because Trump's tariff policy is actually a measure. The purpose is to increase the amount of the regions including the EU, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and even the US companies like Apple are willing to commit to investing in the United States. The part of that amount of money does not know how long it will affect the US dollar index or even our country's safekeeping policy, after all, it is basically a short-term investment.

In fact, we don't have a direct relationship with the investment in the United States right now. It's our strategy to stay dynamic in traditional safe havens, as I said before, and it may be as low as 50 to 55%. That's a relatively high level of dynamic adjustments that can be more than 7 percent of the time, or we'll be one of the corrections in the future.

We don't change this strategy because we have special expectations about the currency. But we will look at the cost of these hedges that are introduced by the market. Of course, if there is so much flow in theory, there are many other factors that you want to say is that there are a lot of people going to buy the dollar, so the dollar index will rise in theory. If this is true, then it is a good thing for Taiwan to be insured because everyone's foreign exchange reserves will increase significantly.

That's why we can add a lot of foreign exchange prices at once, and then we can still go up and down because of foreign exchange. That's why long-term, if there is a next appreciation, there is enough money to do this part of the hedge. So in principle, we don't expect to say the dollar index to rise or depreciate and then do this scenario because we're not really hedged. So we really need to take into account the stability of our entire exchange rate hedge.

In the future, we also have some adjustments in the risk section. In the future, I would like to add to the principle that we will focus on fixed foreign fixed income assets. Other risk assets will be dynamically adjusted as the market conditions change.

I think the problem with this cash body is a real question, of course, that there is no final white paper black word. But from what Trump has announced today, it comes from every country in Asia. I see a lot of countries with billions of dollars in investment plus our government's gold purchase budget today.

That's why this is so much more than three years in the future and so much more time to invest in the U.S. investment in the purchase of such a huge amount of agricultural energy. So I think it's worth paying attention to this impact on the U.S. dollar. So our investment team also has a deep mind to respond to this question.

What is the current proportion of bonds and ETFs in Taiwan? In June, the price of the Taiwan Dollar denominated ETF was roughly the same as before. In general, about 416 billion. It accounts for approximately 5.9% of our total investment amount. 5. 9% of the investment advanced to say double leverage to 124 points. 124 points closer to 125.

So what is the impact of this year's dividends? What is the outlook for this year's dividends? The outlook for this year's dividends policy is still to see a situation at the end of the year. Of course, this year is the end of Trump's tariff policy for financial markets. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
