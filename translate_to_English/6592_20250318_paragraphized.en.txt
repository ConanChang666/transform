This includes Q4 of 63.2 billion. If viewed separately from mainland China in Taiwan, part of Taiwan's coal revenue is 2.41 million. This is the part of YY. YY is a small decline in the overall size of 1%.

Therefore, some of the revenue is eliminated. If not calculated, there is no luck. Some of the 24 years in mainland China is 48.600 million. 13% is 13% higher than the previous year. Mainly because of the continuous growth of the gas cycle. That retains part of the revenue.

So the total amount is 48.6 billion. The next is the net profit after the coal tax. That's the whole part. The net profit after the 24-year coal tax is 32.74 million. There is a segment difference from the previous year, of course. This is mainly because of the last 24 years.

Overall, in the environment, especially in the competent authority. Supervise the enhanced parts. And some product adjustments. So in some high gross profit parts. The part we take also slightly converges. So the net profit after the overall tax is 32.74 billion years.

[559. 00-566. 00] What is the quality of the receivables? Let's take a look at it. [566. 00-570. 00] Here you can see that the total amount of research and development in December 24. [570. 00-572. 00]

[572. 00-577. 00] This is the overall development rate of this amount to 1. 55. [577. 00-581. 00] The main ratio is relative to the situation in which September and June are still recovering. [581. 00-583. 00] There is still a recovery of the rise. [583. 00-585. 00] This is mainly restricted. [585. 00-586. 00] This is restricted. [586. 00-587. 00]

[587. 00-591. 00] Because the quality of the overall distribution of the mainland continues to change. [591. 00-593. 00] This slightly changed relationship. [593. 00-596. 00] The experimental percentage of the mainland is higher. [596. 00-598. 00] The experimental percentage of Taiwan's experiments, we see a slowdown in the overall. [598. 00-601. 00] We see the overall slowdown. [601. 00-605. 00] Therefore, we will continue to pay attention to the overall economic situation of the mainland.

[605. 00-608. 00] There is a part of the experimental rate that will continue to pay attention to. [608. 00-610. 00] The combined revenue of the right half. [610. 00-61. 00] is 289.64 billion. [613. 00-615. 00] YY is 1%. [615. 00-617. 00] The main source is this 24 year. [617. 00-61. 00] This 24 year.

[619. 00-624. 00] is mainly due to the increase in finance lease income. [624. 00-628. 00] The decrease in business lease income is mainly mentioned above. [628. 00-6332. 00] Because we sold the original subsidiary merged this registration section. [632. 00-634. 00] Merge this registration section. [634. 00-637. 00] After this sale, this income is reduced. [637. 00-638. 00]

[638. 00-641. 00] Therefore, part of the operating lease income has been reduced. [641. 00-643. 00] is a relatively significant decrease. [643. 00-645. 00] is mainly due to the impact of the merger. [647. 00-650. 00] Next, we see the portion of the return on the assets compared to the return on shareholders' equity. [650. 00-653. 00] is the portion of the return on shareholders' equity. [653. 00-655. 00]

[655. 00-669. 00] Then the part of the OA is mainly from this effect. [659. 00-661. 00] is 2.48. [661. 00-663. 00] It is mainly from the first. [663. 00-666. 00] This is of course mentioned earlier. [666. 00-668. 00] Because of the relationship between the asset constitution. [668. 00-661. 00] So the overall speaking is 2. 48.

[671. 00-673. 00] Overall return on assets. [673. 00-675. 00] What is the return on shareholders' equity? [675. 00-676. 00] Mainly or mainly. [677. 00-680. 00] Similar to the previous revenue. [680. 00-683. 00] There is also a special effect. [682. 00-684. 00] It is also written here.

[684. 00-686. 00] So that is part 8. 02. [686. 00-693. 00] The other part of the ESG2024 results maintenance. [693. 00-696. 00] We have a variety of input and development in the environmental protection and the promotion of motorcycles to love and social influence. [696. 00-698. 00] There is also a promotion of motorcycles to love. [698. 00-700. 00] There is also a part of the social influence. [700. 00-703. 00] There is a variety of input and development.

[703. 00-705. 00] In the environmental protection section. [705. 00-708. 00] Safeguard the diversity of multi-economy. [708. 00-710. 00] Then wetland conservation action. [710. 00-710. 00] Or north and south of the four capitals. [710. 00-710. 00] Because of that. [712. 00-71. 00] Review the conservation part of this wetland.

[716. 00-719. 00] began this practice from the north. [719. 00-722. 00] After reform is the overall wetland conservation. [722. 00-724. 00] In Taiwan, it is one thing. [724. 00-726. 00] This wetland wetland has a lot of. [726. 00-728. 00] This wetland can be used to protect the environment. [728. 00-731. 00] In order to achieve this whole wetland of the province, wetland can achieve a certain outcome.

[731. 00-743. 00] The overall wetland of the whole country can achieve a certain conservation effect. [735. 00-737. 00] So we in the north and south four include the New Taipei City, South Korea, Kaohsiung. [737. 00-739. 00] contains the New Taipei City, Taiwan, South Korea, Kaohsiung. [739. 00-743. 00] This part of the word has a cooperation with the local wetland of the whole unit or a group. [743. 00-748. 00] There is a cooperation with the local wetland of the whole unit or a group. [748. 00-751. 00] To maintain a good ecological environment.

[751. 00-754. 00] Maintaining a good ecological environment for the part of wetland. [754. 00-755. 00] This ecological environment. [755. 00-758. 00] We have removed a total of exotic plants 356 kg. [758. 00-759. 00] 356 kg. [759. 00-763. 00] It also protects the area of wetland 14 hectares. [763. 00-765. 00] This statement reached a low-carbon operating net zero.

[765. 00-766. 00] Net zero. [766. 00-768. 00] Net carbon is more than 90 hectares. [768. 00-770. 00] Net carbon is more than 90 hectares. [770. 00-773. 00] Net carbon is more than 90 hectares.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the text of the user and organize it into paragraph-based text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any way, so it must be arranged strictly in the order of the original text, while consolidating the content of the original timestamp into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I will read through the entire transcription to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like a Q&A session for a meeting or speech, involving financial data, company strategy, business development, etc. Next, I need to identify the starting point of each question and answer, group them to ensure that each question and corresponding answer is presented consistently.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to some repeated or potentially wrong sentences, such as when answering questions about gross profit margins, there is a duplicate "we still work hard to raise the pressure of interest rate" section, which needs to be retained as if it were not modified. At the same time, some sentences may appear uncoherent due to speech recognition errors, but according to the user's requirements, no rewriting can be made, only according to the original arrangement. In the process, there may be logical jumps between some sentences, which need to be separated by paragraphs to maintain the smoothness of reading. For example, each question and answer should be separated by empty lines, while the answers of the same question remain coherent.

In addition, pay attention to the correct use of punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, etc., to ensure that the sentence structure is correct. Finally, check that the entire paragraph verbatim conforms to all the requirements of the user: do not delete anything, do not rewrite the sentence, keep the original order, and correctly segment. Make sure that there is no missing timestamp corresponding content, and that each question and answer is clear and legible. After completing these steps, read through again, confirm that there is no error, and then output the final result.

TIPS, Taiwan Intellectual Property Management Certification, this part we have achieved for two consecutive years. This is mainly because we have a connection to the internal certification management of intellectual property in some parts of the relevant total intellectual property management. The TCSA Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award is also obtained in 20 years. The next thing is, why the name has always been based on customer first, which is the purpose of our company.

Then go to the Q&A stage. Then ask the investors to enter your questions in the Q&A field, and click on all the co-hosts. Then we'll sort out the questions and get back to you later. First of all, I'll see a few questions here.

The first question is, what is the cost of co-hosting in three consecutive quarters? The idea of the company is that after all, the development rate is not very deteriorating. Well, I'd like to explain here, because although the development actually has a vague situation, but in fact, we have a set of problems in the company, some of the internal planning methods, including our normal parts are listed with the expected situation. Frankly speaking, we will consider several factors, the first is that the normal parts just mentioned is based on the past 7 years of experience, of course, there is a future hypothesis, here may feel a little conservative, but this is also a company policy to deal with the expected part.

In the fourth quarter, the gross profit margin generated is 60%, different from the industry, because it cuts I-Rent, or because there is an improvement in interest rate pricing? Well, here I'm going to point out, of course, that we continue to sell to consumers, which is what keeps our gross profit margins above a certain level, which is the first. That's why investors here have asked whether it's a cut I-Rent, I-Rent, and that's why it's the reason why I-Rent, its gross profit margin is actually lower than the average of the company, and its gross profit margin is usually higher than the average of its combined individuals.

We are still trying to increase the pressure on our interest rate, we are still trying to increase the pressure on our interest rate, we are trying to increase the pressure on our interest rate, we transfer to consumers as much as possible, thank you. This question is basically about the growth of the company in 2025, basically we are also divided into two parts, we in Taiwan part of the growth will mainly come from just reported, there is the

The following is a paragraph-based transcription of any sentence that was rearranged according to the original sentence: --- and the so-called nucleus experience of the machine industry text. So these two companies are growing energies. It should be to maintain double digits. The nucleus body is basically what it is. The researchers just wanted to ask again.

What is the R&D rate in Taiwan. In 2014, the expected credit loss was 55.4 billion yuan. The credit cost was about 1.84%. The company estimated this year's credit cost target.

Probably around 1.3%. Then the credit cost. I'm not sure if the credit cost here is to remove an asset with the expected loss of credit. So I don't know how to set this goal. But I can talk about scratching.

This is the kind of thing we see in this world that we see in the world, and we see in the world that we see in the world, and we see in the world that we see in the world that we see in the world that we see in the world.

So we see that there is a slow or at least a slow decline, which is what we see now. That part of China, if you look at the historical data, Q4 certainly has a slight increase in Q3.

Yes, yes, in the first quarter. We still see it openly in the first quarter, because it still has an annual factor, because it is based on the historical experience, that is, it is usually the first quarter that will be affected by the annual factor.

So we expect it to be there. It will go up a little bit, so we may see that the second season can be a bit clearer. So here we are in China generally may be under constant monitoring, but yes, it is.
