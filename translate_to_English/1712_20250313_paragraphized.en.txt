<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcripts provided by the user and organize them into paragraph format. First, I need to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, can only adjust the punctuation, line change, and paragraph merge, while keeping the original order and meaning.

In addition, it is necessary to fill the appropriate punctuation mark at the end of the sentence. In the same paragraph, you can only change lines by empty line, each paragraph 3-6 words, and the subject to change. First, I will read the entire punctuation script to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a transcription of the company's corporate briefing session, including company introduction, financial information, and Q&A sessions. Next, I need to identify the speaker, such as "host", "spoker", etc., and keep these marks.

During the processing process, it is necessary to pay attention to the processing of timestamps. The raw data provided by the user contains timestamps, but the user requests to output only the edited text, so timestamps need to be removed. At the same time, to ensure that the connection between sentences is natural, add appropriate punctuation, such as commas, periods, etc., but cannot add new content.

It is important to note that some sentences may be duplicated, such as "and select good food" repeated many times, but the user requests not to delete anything, so all duplicate sentences must be kept and correctly segmented. When processing financial data, it is necessary to ensure that the accuracy of the numbers and terminology, such as "189.3 billion", "43 billion", etc., cannot be changed. At the same time, pay attention to the parts of the regional sales ratio, need to be segmented correctly to ensure that the data in each region is clearly presented.

In addition, the user mentions that the allowed operations include adjusting the punctuation and line change, so it is necessary to check if the end of each sentence is correct using the period, exclamation mark, or question mark. For example, some sentences in the raw data have no punctuation at the end of the sentence, and need to be filled. For example, you should add a period after "all investment advanced afternoon". In the process, you also need to pay attention to the division of paragraphs.

Similarly, the different parts of the financial data (e.g. revenue, gross margin, debt ratio, etc.) should be segmented to ensure logical clarity. Finally, check the entire document to ensure that there is no missing anything, punctuation marks are correct, paragraph division is reasonable, and all adjustments are limited to punctuation and formatting.

Today's online team also has a corporate governance director, Eric Kong, and accounting director, Eric Lai. For the full financial business information of the company, please check it out from the public information observation online. Thank you.

First of all, let's ask Mr. Jiang to explain the first part of the presentation. Investing in advanced afternoon tea, first of all, a brief introduction of today's presentation, is divided into three parts. The first part is an introduction, a brief introduction. The second part is to report on the financial information of 2024, and the last part of our QA question time.

The Group has been focusing on four major areas: production business, chemical synthesis, biotechnology, plant protection, safe food and household goods. The focus of the Group's business is on sustainable development, from seed to table as the core of the Group.

The company has a total of 260 new agricultural supply centers in Taiwan, including seed seedlings, plant protection goods and materials, and professional visits to promote new agricultural products belonging to new farmers, and use the flow of crop cultivation management mode to serve local farmers. These are the new listing promotion activities, continue to cooperate with schools, farms, farms, farms and other units, and will continue to add new locations in the appropriate place in the future.

The first part of the 2024 business segment we saw the share of 2024 business projects, consolidated revenue of 18.9 billion, decreased by 1% year-on-year. Among them, the plant protection department of 1.1 billion, decreased by 4 billion, decreased by 4% year-on-year. Plant protection mainly South America's sandworm market performance declines by 1. billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year, mainly in Zhubei and Taoyuan new stores, so the third part of the sales growth of domestic products is 2.7 billion, 10% year-on-year, mainly Yumei's performance growth and the channel growth of household products.

The fourth part is the unemployment of Yufan Lake mud, which reduces the unemployment of 900 million, reduces the number of 8%, and decreases the year by 8%. Next, we see the sales share of different regions, the sales share of the new agricultural group in Taiwan accounted for 60%, namely, Taiwan plant preservation 18%, supermarket 23%, household goods group accounted for 14%, and mud 5%. The remaining 40% are all overseas revenues, the rest 40% are overseas revenues.

In addition, the part of the sales cost, mainly increased sales costs, the main reason for the increase of sales costs is the ship's shipping price, the part of the export cost more than 80 million, which this year's independent investment in drug administration also increased expenses, increased more than 70 million, which is the whole business cost increase, so this part of the business benefit is a slight decrease. The industry's revenue and expenditure compared to last year's period is not much different, because the above reasons, resulting in the net profit before this tax decreased 3147 million, the owner's net profit of the parent company 10.5 million, EPS is 2.5 yuan.

In 2024, the EPS of 2024 was 2.5, and the Board's decision of cash dividend was 2.5. Today, it's just the attendance day of the company, the distribution ratio is 100%, and the cash dividend is expected to be issued on April 16th. All investors, if there are any questions can be raised online.

Well, do you have any questions? Well, all of you, if you have any questions? With regard to the profitability of our subsidiaries, we have a detailed explanation on the steps at the bottom of our earnings report. I can tell you about last year's final settlement.

In 2024, the net profit after the profit tax of 230 million was 22% in 2023. So we see that we have announced the revenue and profit of each subsidiary in the last year has continued to grow. Because we do not have an advanced mention of Yumei in 2025 because we do not speculate that I just spoke 2024. So I just mentioned that in the case of his revenue from January to February, he was 12 percent of the total profit growth of Yumei in the year to February.

It is the iras86 M b u g is the remaining of our alleged foreign goods ë¬´ Deny is also the official implementation of the online market arena is also going to inquisition is then redeemed, but the police's latest so you want to know why not look at this tire at entre klar.
