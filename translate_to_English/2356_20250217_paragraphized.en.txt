<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided to see how these verbatim texts are reorganized into consecutive paragraphs.

First of all, the transcription begins with the invitation of JP Morgan, and then the update and Q&A arrangements on the operating status. The next is about the status of the fourth and third quarters, as well as the data on the full-year 2024 laptop shipments. After that, the outlook for 2025, including the shipping of commercial computers and AI servers, as well as the impact of tariffs and geopolitics, as well as the growth of smart devices.

Each major topic (e.g. laptops, servers, smart devices) should be a separate segment to ensure the information is clear. The Q&A section also needs to be handled separately to maintain the consistency of the questions and answers. It is important to note that the user's verbatim has some time interval between stamps, such as [30. 00-32. 72] and suddenly jumps to [32. 72-35. 42], the middle may be missing, but the user does not provide, so it must strictly follow the provided text processing.

In addition, some sentences may have overlap or jump in timestamps, but they must remain the same, without any modification. During the finishing process, make sure that the sentence sequence within each paragraph is correct, and that the timestamp corresponds accurately. For example, the description of the fourth quarter shipment should appear consistently in the same paragraph, while the portion of the outlook for 2025 needs to be integrated with the content of different timestamps. At the same time, pay attention to the structure of the Q&A section, questions and answers should correspond, keeping the natural flow of the conversation. Finally, check if there are missing sentences or timestamp errors, make sure that all the contents are correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs.

First of all, I would like to thank JP Morgan for attending the CFO CEO Foreign Conference.

First of all, let's take a look at the Q&A for our current operating status. Well, first of all, let's take a look at the Q4. In terms of revenue we've already announced, the fourth quarter is our operating peak. In the fourth quarter of the notebook, there is actually a case where the original Forecase is a relatively minor improvement, but the actual shipping situation, the laptop is 5.4 million, that is, a slight improvement from our original. On the one hand, there are some early pull-off phenomenon on the issue of some tariffs, on the one hand, because Commercial has a shipment on a commercial laptop and gaming side, and there is still a pull-off shipment in the fourth quarter.

Well, the fourth quarter is coming to our operating highs. Compared to the first quarter, the fourth quarter has a high season, so the first quarter of the notebook virtually shows a low season effect. And in the year 2025, we are still optimistic that there is a commercial on the side of the notebook, which is the commercial side of the shipping power, is a touch of energy from Windows 10, which makes the notebook commercial side of the commercial side of the more powerful shipping power.

Servers are usually divided into enterprise servers, cloud customers in the US, and cloud customers in the country, and the three customers in the fourth quarter also showed a good shipment status, so in the fourth quarter the total amount of shipments reached the high. Compared to the first quarter, because the fourth quarter is a high shipment, coupled with some from the first quarter is also accelerating to the fourth quarter, the server in the fourth quarter also has a relatively low season effect.

So, we can actually provide some costs under the policy of supply. In the last project, the smart device was also shown a growth trend in last year 2024, mainly consumer products in the last year there are some new products, but also some new customers contribution. The smart product outlook for this year 2025 is still another growth, but this growth is also relatively large, but this growth is also a me to high single digit, the most important part of the smart device is already scattered on this side, now in Vietnam plants and Malaysian factories have a distribution capacity, so in response to tariff issues and the dispersed production of customers, the smart device should have been more fully prepared.

Well, in the fourth quarter, we actually came up with a high shipment, in addition to a more commercial in the enterprise type of shipping capacity continues to continue, and the customer because there is a effect of pre-loading, the customer may also have a pre-stocking on the fourth quarter, so the fourth quarter makes us the most likely to ship in the whole quarter. Of course, in 2025, we still look forward to a Windows Represent Cycle, in the commercial section or there is a Windows 10 Represent Cycle, which is especially in the commercial model will get a little more obvious. So we look forward to 2025 compared to 2024 or a growth method, we have a better effect in the 2025 year. Thank you.

This year, we have a similar Blackwell model with customers, especially in the GB200 has some supply chain problems in the past, but this year also saw customers come back to ask the X86 system, the V200 HGS and the next generation V300 HGS distribution, customers are very interested in some capital expenditure on the customer's announcement of this year's customer's purchase of a hardware, this year also there is a slight increase in the previous year, so customers are more interested in these high-end applications or very interested in the V200 HGS, and some music is only a relatively high-level model in the past.
