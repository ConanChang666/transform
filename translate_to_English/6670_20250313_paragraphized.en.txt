Here is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: Everyone, today is the afternoon. I'm going to take a few minutes to update some of the company's profile first. Next, I'll go straight to Q&A to see if you have any problems. Recently, I've got some more news, especially the so-called COVID cases and psychological encouragement.

Last year we made about 200 big 3.7, which was about 16.4% higher than 23 years. The gross profit margin was good, and the gross profit margin was about 26.7, which should be considered a high point in history. It looks like the end of February this year is probably higher than that, so the whole situation seems more divinely optimistic.

Last year, it was a relatively solid situation that had already reflected the customer's refurbishment and the end-point demand did not fall off, so the overall score was a good result. That looked like a trend to go up and down when I looked at the whole chain. It just brought me a little bit to the point that the level of gross margin also looks pretty good, and it should be a new level of gross margin. Of course, this gross margin is a high point in addition to benefits and benefits, as well as a product portfolio that we also have in Vietnam, which is one of the reasons why. Looking at the whole asset does not mean that we were at the end of 24 years, our cash level was about 4.7 billion, which was also the bottom of the year when it was distributing green or making a so-called investment case.

Our Net Cash can be seen to say that our plan is not very little, about 1.2 billion, so Net Cash is almost $2 billion, which is probably our situation. The current company is almost gone, which is the part of Siri1. Now because this year's new encouragement coupled with the subscription relationship, we may send a Siri again this year. Here we also made a pre-announced report with investors, and this is probably the case. We made a 28. 17, based on a resolution from the board of directors and a promise from the investor before we probably have a distribution rate of 65 to 70, so today we can be 70.

That looks to be close to 20, so the current stock price should look like the whole year end should be more than 6% is a good condition. Or the industry war or Goal-related or living in the public, about this place is written 68, probably the first and the main part of our head. If you add some other parts of Australia should be about 80%. The other 10% is that you may be interested in people's livelihood, etc., there are some problems, so you can exchange it again.

In the future, if our entire TO public income is going to be smooth, we will take into account the profit of the handiwork area. However, the current revenue is not large, probably we look at the amount of about 30 million dollars. Of course, we ourselves have to do a handiwork area before we do this investment project, etc. We can also explain to you. The whole page or Goal, so a situation on the side of Goal is to take some time to explain. The entire industry in the fourth quarter of last year, the performance of a retail market in the United States, because the United States is probably the most popular market, YY is about 5%.

We have a 4% increase in Q4 compared to the previous quarter before the outbreak of the previous Q424-year Q4 and the 19-year pandemic. That is a 3% increase in Q4 compared to the previous year. That is why the overall high-market movement has increased by about 4% before the outbreak of the pandemic. We think that after the outbreak, we may be able to join the high-demand movement during the pandemic, and these people will go back to doing the original leisure activities.

It seems that after the verification of these Quats, the trend has formed, in fact, that the entire revenue of our previous market, about 171, was probably about sixteen-seven-four-six. That's because we have increased the market size of a Goal in our industry, so the EPS of the basic market is obviously growing earlier than before. That's why our stock price has been raised in so-called 200 or even below fluctuations now to more than three-thirds of the situation. I think that in addition to re-rating, a large part of the whole of the fundamental fundamental has been lower than before.

But some of the bottom line is that we got a couple of new customers here because of the Trump tax on Mexico anyway 25 we have some of our customers in Mexico with assemblers. Now we hope we can help in this regard, which is also a good bottom line for us this year. Next, let's talk about one of the first two days we announced.

We decided to acquire the BASIC tool by way of the so-called public acquisition, PO, 6904, 51% of the BASIC tool common stock, about 157 yuan, the expected acquisition of 9453, so a total investment amount of about 14.800 million. You have the opportunity to see the press conference of BASIC, know that it is a well-integrated deal, so next is that we made a so-called 20-day public acquisition, from March 12 to March 31, and everything smooth, about April 8 or 9, we will be a complete delivery, so the official so-called BASIC tool, to meet the five billion estimates, there are some conditions, you can be interested in further communication, the board's resolution, one distribution is 9. 7, just said that this is a history after 2032, but the year the push rate should be less than 60, because there is more, that 22, then the last year is 28, and about 20 pieces, we see the whole of the application of the whole of Fuji with us.

We are an investment in Ever-Living Sustainable. So we are creating a synergistic effect in this regard. We are more focused on these short-term so-called return of capital rates. Instead, we are going to talk about this.

To illustrate the success of one of our investments, the company itself is a Chamber of Commerce company. It has been around 40 years since its establishment.

Revenue is 900 million. So the volume is small. But its products are also very unique. It is called the event hand-held field. It is currently the largest in Asia. One of the world's top three event hand-held professional field.

Its customers are well-known brands in Japan and Europe. Like Stanley like SnapHonk. Some of them may have never heard of it. Go to Google to know that these are a large brand.

The product is divided into all hydroelectric machinery infrastructure and aerial vehicles are used. It is one of the few hand tools manufacturers listed in Taiwan. Hand tools are about to talk about. In principle, it is about doing so called pneumatic power. With ordinary hand tools. Pneumatic power is the Auto tool.

General hand tools are things that do not have any electromechanical on them. Like Hammer, Driver. There are other things like Ranch hand tools. There are some cuts. The original intention of the so-called scissors are those. In fact, Taiwan hand tools are listed.

Strictly speaking, there are two. One is 6904. Another is called Shulong. Shulong is also a number of tools manufacturers in Taichung.

It's not an OEM. It's 90% OEM. Inhouse's so-called self-developed design capabilities are very strong.

Maori is very high. Everyone knows his earnings. It's a level of about 1% on the market. It's also a member of the operating team. It includes the chairman, the general manager and the vice president.

When we work together, we will make some adjustments in this regard. Especially in a structure of the Board of Directors. Now the industry is very attached. Because the founder once served as the chairman of the Taiwan Hand Tool Federation.

It is also a state of being full of trade union members, so it is my respect for them. The industry relations are also very good, because they are already in the future.

Many people are not going to take the next two generations. They have two generations to take the next one. They have done ten years after the next one. It feels like there may be a lot of money in life. Life does not have to spend all the time in the factory. So in this case.

Laden can talk about it again. So he invited us to do it together. The hand tools industry was probably just mentioned. It was about 10 billion. In fact, more than 12,300 million people. It was a machine.

The so-called electrocution hole is removed. The pure hand tools are about 7.8 billion. It is also not small. But it is very very. We have been produced in Taiwan by the top three or the top five hand tools. Exported.

We are also No. 1. And there are a lot of engine relationships. This industry is very special. Each company is probably only one item. Everyone knows each other. 340 years ago.

We all go to the US to find customers. Find newarki to find TTI customers. Go to call. You do your thing. I do my thing.

One star shopping, but one star shopping is not only one company provides. There are several companies that come together. We all have this kind of passion. So the hand tool industry is mainly in China.

The day of the Lord is at hand, and the day of the Lord is at hand, and the day of the Lord is at hand, and the day of the Lord is at hand, and the day of the Lord is at hand.

The other 70% are in the central area. 30% are in these places such as Southern Daan or Taoyuan.

There are more than 2,000 outsourced vendors coming in. So it can be imagined. An ecology of a supply of this hand tool industry is very dispersed.

"We have seen a lot of them, and we have seen a lot of them," he said, "and we have seen a lot of them, and we have seen a lot of them," he said.

Do the pliers. Do the so-called school driver. But this has been the case in recent years. The mainland price competition. Some geopolitical. Tariffs.

The problem of sub-humanization. Even ESG problems. In fact, they are either a cost plus or a challenge. You don't have a lot of revenue for your individual business. And you have limited resources. And you have to deal with these problems.

It's hard to deal with these problems alone. It's been a while. It's always been a conversation in the industry. But no one has ever taken the first step. That's actually what we're talking about in 2017, 2016, 2018.

We were invited to Taichung. Talk to these hand tools companies about the possibility of a strategic alliance. We spent about a year there. Find out.

Some companies are talking about a possibility of strategic merging. When there may be some subjective objective factors that are actually not mature. Then there is no ending. So I want to say. We are not going to run into this industry suddenly. We have been studying this industry for a while.

And most of all, in the last few years. We still have production every year. Our American factory is closed. Before closing, the proportion of hand tools in the US factory is 50%.

So we say that we do our own hand tools. In the US factory and Taiwan together. There should be more than 400 million levels, so we are not familiar with this field or have had a strategy.

He is the creator of the universe, and he is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe, and he is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe. He is the creator of the universe.

What is Fuji's strength? Metal forming metal. We are not just metal processes.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so the order and integrity of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I read through the entire transcription to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this is a discussion about business, strategic alliances, integration programs, and international cooperation. Next, I need to reorganize the sentences that are phrased in a sequence of consecutive paragraphs, while keeping the original sequence intact. Next, I check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp in a sequence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the first sentence is "we still have to turn it into a finish put," which may appear to be misspellings, such as "finished product" or other terms, but the user requests do not rewrite, so keep it as well.

For example, a portion of the company's business scope (such as "we do gold cloud head" to "small scale") can be merged into a paragraph. A portion of the investment and strategic alliance (such as "just buy" to "the opportunity to join with other companies in the future") can be combined into another paragraph. International cooperation (such as "outside Taiwan" to "industrial assemblies") is also a natural paragraph. It is important to note that some sentences may not be grammatical or structurally consistent, but the user requests do not be rewritten, so they can only be arranged in the same order. For example, "Autumn buds to eat" may be an oral expression, and the original sentences need to be preserved even if they look incomplete.

In the process, I will make sure that the sequence of sentences within each paragraph is consistent with the original alphabetical text and that nothing is added or deleted. At the same time, check if there is a duplicate or need to merge, but according to the user's request, no modifications can be made, only reordering. Finally, I will read the finishing paragraph verbicated text to make sure that all sentences are correctly sorted, without any omissions or misplacements, and in line with the user's requirements.

We do gold cloud head. Or gold cloud of anequipment. Mainly we are in the application of the product. Autumn rice head and autumn rice has to do.

Including Taiwan Mainland Hong Kong Vietnam Thailand United States. In fact, we operate a scale. In fact, in the so-called metal forming of a finished product of an industry. The scale is not small. The whole management side of a so-called stand. It is also very large.

This is our strength. The number of workers is about two thousand. So we think so. Just buy it. Only invest in this company makes sense for us a little bit. Because it's only 9 billion.

We have 283 billion. We want to do one. Eight words. This company acts as a strategic alliance. Later we have to form a so-called platform. Next we have to focus on these situations that I just talked about.

Let's see if there's a better opportunity to do a better integration. Then expand the platform. That's the first step. Let's take the first step. This question is in the central area. The Taiwan hand tool industry has been talking for a while.

We've all been waiting. We've taken this step first. We want to be able to do some sort of integration in the future. Next, we'll deliver our performance. Attract or continue to explore.

In the future, we will have a chance to join with other players. It is outside of Taiwan. In fact, we have a lot of industries in Japan. Mainly in New West Side. There are also in Germany.

There is also Spain. In fact, there is an industry group of it. This is also in order that we can continue to rise. A situation called upside potential is also explained here.

There are some achievements outside of the profession. Some of the most important are the so-called public relations acquisitions. Do a simple explanation here. Next, open.
