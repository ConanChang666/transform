Thank you for signing up for today's Investor Conference. I'm a spokesperson for Pay Plus, Simon. Today I'm honored to speak to you about the company's operational results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and our latest developments in transitional development and sustainability.

First of all, I would like to stress again that adding a salary sludge not only remains stable on traditional core business, but adds a new growth momentum to the company through a positive transformation strategy. This robust development model is the key to continuing to create value for shareholders in the face of market challenges. Overall, in terms of operational data, in the fourth quarter of 2024, our operating revenue reached $29.85 billion, up 3% over the same period last year.

Gross profit margin reached $4.5 billion and gross profit margin rose from 12.6% of the same period last year to 14.6%. This result was due to the continued increase in hotel revenue, although the operating profit margin declined slightly from the same period last year, the revenue and expenditure from outside the business increased significantly to $538 billion, an increase of 134% year-on-year. This is mainly due to the increase in dividends from the previous year to $35.6 billion, and the continued stable benefit of a business reinvested.

EBITDA reached $88.6 billion, an annual increase of 7%. The data are sufficient to show a strong growth in the company's overall profitability. Next, we look at a performance aspect of each business. In recent years, while the transformation and development of the lodging business, the original manufacturing cornerstone business continues to maintain a steady contribution. Cement business as the company's traditional core business, revenue reached 12.2 billion yuan.

These businesses have maintained stable operating performance and made an important contribution to the company's overall revenue. In a case of stable business operations in 2020 and continued growth of hospitality services, the business share has become nearer and in line with the 4 3 2 1 we previously reported to you. It is expected that revenue under a stable operating structure will be a share of this type. Next, I would like to introduce the focus and detail of our excellent performance in the revenue service business.

As a free brand in our hospitality business, Hotel Collective has written a remarkable chapter in our performance. Not only did we earn revenue, but we have demonstrated strong growth momentum and excellent business performance on a number of so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-so.

This is not only an improvement in our brand value, but also a high recognition of the market for our high-quality service and excellent accommodation experience. In the first two months of the year, Hotel Collective's housing rate exceeded our previous record and reached a new high of more than 90%. This result not only opened a good start for our operations this year, but also demonstrated a strong competitive and sustainable growth in the market.

In addition to profitability, it is also important to create a good reputation and a good brand. To all of you, the team maintains a high standard of service in the case of high housing rates and human resources shortages, allowing us to have a good rating outside. We have been awarded the Travelers Review Awards from Booking.com for the third year in a row, as well as the 2024 Customer Review Award from Agoda.

In the process of the company's continuous transformation, the annual profits and losses may be ups and downs, but the management team's efforts to create and enhance the value of the company, while still want to maintain a stable distribution rate. This is a company's shareholders' attention and persistence. In addition to the excellent performance of operations and services, our efforts in sustainable development have also been highly recognized by international rating agencies. We know that the company's development not only pursues economic benefits, but also assumes social responsibility and achieves the harmonious development of the environment, society and economy.

We are committed to reducing carbon emissions and achieving a green operation. We also pay attention to the effective use of resources and strive to reduce the environmental impact. In terms of social responsibility, we pay attention to the well-being of our employees and provide a good working environment and development opportunities. We are also actively involved in the construction of communities, giving back to society and contributing to the power of the enterprise.

At the end of the day, we understand that sound and transparent corporate governance is the cornerstone of corporate sustainability.

We are proud to announce that we have received international recognition for our continuous progress. We are honored to report to you the latest developments. In our first participation in the international carbon structure project, the SMEs of CDP, we have received the highest B rating for the first time. This is a testament to our leadership in risk management and information transparency in climate issues.

Looking forward to the future, Jiaxing cement will adhere to the corporate philosophy of Pursuing Quality of Life and keep moving towards a sustainable goal at a steady pace. That is a briefing for today. Thank you for all of you for your continued support.

So if the online advances are still thinking about asking questions, we have a few questions we have collected before signing up for a statistical process, and we first answer. First of all, there are advanced questions about our hotel, we have a hotel, we have a hotel, we have a hotel, we have a hotel.

It is expected that more than half of the rental area will be a goal. We will wait for the data to be more clear when we should quickly follow you to do a report and explain this. There is also an advanced question here that some companies have said about the future operation of a land in an asset revitalization as its main operating effect. Let's take a look at it and see what we have planned and thought about such an asset revitalization issue.

Overall, there are some lands that we were initially considering not being able to make changes to the floor for further planning and development. Of course, some of them are still waiting for the approval of the competent authority. So in fact, we are actually doing some management of the assets by renting them. But in fact, from the previous financial data, we also saw that the income of the rental is about 100 million operating for me every year. It is actually a very stable source. In the previous reports, we also mentioned that our occupancy rate is near full rental.

We will also closely monitor some of the actionable solutions that are carefully evaluated throughout the market. We will also closely monitor the action of the entire market. When we choose a suitable time to mature, we will also propose further explanations to create more benefits for shareholders and the company. So I think there are two questions to answer first.

I stopped here and didn't know there were some advances on the line that didn't want to ask any more questions or to add to the question. We're going to go ahead, good, good.
