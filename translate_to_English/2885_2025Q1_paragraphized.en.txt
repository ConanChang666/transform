Please go to the fourth page. The focus on this page is to introduce our ROE's goals and dividend policies. We hope to ensure a predictable return for our shareholders.

From the top right, we can see our future ROE goal is 9% to 11%. From the top left, we can see the past five. In addition to the top left, we have reached the goal in 2022. We are committed to achieving the goal of risk control under the premise of raising higher than the market average return. From the bottom right, we can see that we are committed to maintaining a clear and consistent incentive policy.

50% to 60% of the entry rate is distributed annually as a cash incentive. From 2024 for example, we issued a cash incentive of $1.55 per share. This is equivalent to 56% of the distribution rate. Please turn to page 5. The fifth page explains the difference between us and other peers. From the picture above, we can see that we used to be at the core of securities in the past.

From the chart below we can also observe that our capital city reserve has long been higher than the regulatory requirements.

In addition to being able to maintain a higher rate of return than the market. At the same time, we also reserve the kinetic energy of capital. Enough to meet a demand for the future market. Please go to page 6. From this page, explain how we look at risk. Investment in Yuanta Financial Holdings is concentrated in the development market.

It is through products, services and customers, etc., to strengthen our core business. Yuanta Investment Trust's net profit after the first half of the tax is 20,5 billion yuan. Increases by 18% year-on-year. Mainly because the growth of AEOM leads to an increase in management fees. Yuanta Futures Tax net profit of 1.3 billion yuan.

33% year-on-year increase. Primarily due to the increase in margin interest income. Net profit after Yuanta Life Tax is 1.5 billion yuan. Reduce by 92% year-on-year.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and rewrite them into paragraph-provided transcription while keeping everything intact and not summarised. First, I need to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to make sure that I fully understand the task requirements. The most important thing is that the user emphasizes that it is not necessary to delete, rewrite or condensate any of the original content, so I have to make sure that each sentence is preserved and arranged in the original order of time. Next, I need to check the provided transcription fragments, each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences.

First of all, I will make sure that the order of each timestamp is correct, but note that the user does not have to be arranged in the order of timestamps, but in the logical order of the sentences in the speech. Therefore, it may be necessary to adjust according to the consistency of the content, but the user does not explicitly specify this, so it may be possible to keep the original order. However, if you take a closer look at the content, some sentences may belong to the same topic and should be merged into paragraphs. For example, from "Our short-term goal is to increase the overseas contribution to 12% to 15%", the next sentences may be related to overseas expansion and should be merged together.

At the same time, some sentence timestamps provided by the user may be small jumps or duplicates, such as [658. 48-660. 28] are "please turn to page 19", but after the timestamps start from [663. 96-667. 52], there are some time intervals in the middle, which may be due to the way the original content is recorded, but as an editor should keep the original order unchanged, and do not need to adjust the timeline of the timestamps, simply sort the sentences in the original order. Next, I need to consider each sentence as a separate content unit, and then determine which sentences can naturally be combined into paragraphs according to the context. For example, when a speaker mentions a page and interprets its content, the relevant sentences should be merged into a paragraph, while different topics are separated into separate paragraphs. For example, on the market structure, starting from page 17, discuss market changes, ETFs, etc. These may need to be merged into a paragraphs.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to the repeated "please turn to page X" and each "turn to page" hint may follow the corresponding interpretation, so each page after the sentence should be kept together with the interpretation of the page, forming a separate small paragraph. During the processing process, it is necessary to ensure that no sentence is missing, and all content is retained, even if some sentences are not logically coherent or different topics. For example, the content of Yuanta Insurance may form paragraphs separately, while the bank's data is another paragraph.

In addition, note that some small errors in timestamps, such as [628. 52-630. 96], "PrimerBorder" may be misspelled, but the user requests not to rewrite the content, so it should remain as it should be. Finally, the finishing paragraph verbatim text should conform to the following structure: each paragraph has a main topic, followed by a detailed explanation sentence, each flippage prompt is a new paragraph or subsection, all the original sentences are included and not deleted or merged.

In the next page, we can see that Taiwan's brokerage market is quite centralized, and the top ten brokerages have a total market share of 54%, which is not very large over the years. In the top ten, we ranked first, and in the first half of 2025, our market share of 13.5%. Please go to page 18, which illustrates a change in market contribution and structure.

Since 2024, more and more institutional investors have entered the Taiwan market and continue to enter the first half of 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2023, retail accounts accounted for 60%, but the most recent data showed that retail accounts reached 53.4%, foreign investment accounted for 33.9%, set a record high, and local institutions accounted for 12.7%.

Our FINNIT market share has increased from 3% in early 2023 to 8%, which means we focus on PrimerBorder's services and provide first-hand trading solutions for foreign clients. Please go to page 19 and turn to 17% of our market share in financing. From the right chart, we can see that the first half of 2025 was down to $367 billion, down 15%, mainly due to uncertain factors such as US tariffs, which made investors more cautious.

The first half of 2025 averaged $44.8 billion, a 15% decline compared to the whole year of 2024. Our view of the average daily turnover in the second half of the year is about 47 billion, but you can see that we have a particularly hot August market, and the average daily turnover in the month is about 59 billion, which also means that our Yuanta securities have a very good profit performance in August.

This is due to the unstable financial environment in the first half of the stock market, the decline in the volatility of the stock market, Taiwan broker profits more than the same period last year most of the double-digit recession, our Yuanta securities profit increased by 3%, net income declined by 1%, securities lending business-related losses by exchange rate fluctuations, showing that if it is restored, self-owned income in the first half of the year increased by 47%, other income decreased by 5%.

Please turn to page 23. We can see that the overall asset size of Yuanta Investment has reached 2.49 trillion yuan. From the product structure, the aggregate of Taiwan-based ETFs, bond ETFs and leveraged back to ETFs has reached 90% of the total size, and the number of ETF beneficiaries has reached 519 million. It is worth noting that the regular amount of inflows reaches $345 billion, which also shows that investors have developed a habit of long-term investing, which has a considerable benefit to Yuanta Investment's steady inflow of funds.

In the first half of the chart, we can see that our client margin of $1691 billion, which is 21% higher than the end of 2024, accounting for 35% of the industry. This part comes from the market demand for leverage and inverse ETFs. In terms of market share, the domestic market share of options trading is 19% and the foreign market share is 24%, and we continue to maintain a position in our county. Please go to page 25.

Please turn to page 27. Yuanta Bank is a round-the-clock futures transaction, Yuanta Bank's net profit after the first half of 2025 reached 52.96 billion yuan, an increase of 2% year-on-year, in terms of net income, in the first half of the year total of 142.7 billion yuan, an increase of 95% year on year, the capital city population is stable, the level is superior to the regulatory requirements, and I will do further details on the next page.

In the first half of 2025, Yuanta Bank's net interest income reached 8.6 billion yuan, an increase of 20% year-on-year, and an increase of about half of all corporate finance and consumer finance. Among them, loans from mortgages and general businesses accounted for 68.2%, our YP loans increased by 28% year-on-year, with a share of 6% from the beginning of 2024. Our strategic goal in 2025 will be to adjust the structure of the loan, focusing on YP loans with high spreads, as well as setting a high Single Digit growth target.

In the first half of 2025, our net handling fee income reached 37.3 billion yuan, up 23% year-on-year, accounting for 73% of wealth management. In the first half of 2025, our wealth management process, combined with our common goods, accounted for about 73%. In the wealth management process, we value our banking products, especially investment and retirement planning policies, and we hope to continue to maintain more than 50% of the movement.

When it comes to asset quality, our core goal is to continuously create a high-quality relaxed organization. --- This release fully preserves all the content of the original verbatim, groups only the statements in semantics and logic into paragraphs, and maintains the original timestamp information.

Thank you, Mr. Frank's briefing, we are now open to you to ask questions. Thank you very much. Hello, do you hear what you are saying? I am Otis, sorry, I would like to ask Grant for the achievement of the bank here, just mentioned that in fact, this year's interest income and handling fee income is not good, but I see that in August the profitability of the bank here is a stable situation, I do not know whether it is because we are the operation of the bond part of the operation, because we are not the part of the bond part of the operation, because we look at the individual report, we are a very large number of bonds on the side of the TPL, so it is here some Motomarket loss to offset the overall profit of the other performance of the situation, the first question.

This year, the main decline in the overall profit from financial control is actually a year-long decline from life, of course, we know that this is the exchange rate, is the April exchange rate is the problem, we want to ask you, Yichen, this year's life here in the next four months a button side of the idea. The last question is to say, because now the market and bond market are very volatile, I want to say that at least in the bank side can not share the future of our stock, of course, we see that the interest income of our stock this year is actually increased, then ask the bank side of the future of the stock and bond side of the last four months of the operating plan, these three questions are thank you for the advanced question, I think the first question is in the first half of the first half of the trading part of the bond is relatively less expected, especially some of the original bond currently there is a market loss, so, as you just said in the other non-banked growth, but there is needed to continue to continue to follow the problem.

[1590. 76-1591. 76] Hey Otis. [1591. 76-159. 76] is the Vice President. [1593. 76-159. 76] I'll probably talk to you first. [159. 76-159. 76] Understand. [159. 76-159. 76] Hey. [1599. 76-1600. 76] Yes.

[1600. 76-1602. 76] Because of my concern. [1602. 76-1606. 76] I'm a little more concerned about it. [1606. 76-1608. 76] Because it's like the second season is. [1608. 76-1612. 76] Taiwan Dollar is a sole proprietorship for the Australian dollar. [1612. 76-1614. 76] In fact, all of us. [1614. 76-1617. 76] Other is an exchange rate equal to our currency.

[1617. 76-1619. 76] is actually for me. [1619. 76-1622. 76] Of course, there will be one because the NFB ban. [1622. 76-1624. 76] There will be a condition for a loss. [1624. 76-1626. 76] Of course, all of our TPLs. [1626. 76-1628. 76] This is my income from the profit table. [1628. 76-1630. 76] This will also be received.

[1630. 76-1632. 76] That is when we say this. [1632. 76-1634. 76] That is because we are the brokers in Asia Pacific. [1634. 76-1636. 76] In fact, I say to my Taiwan dollars.
