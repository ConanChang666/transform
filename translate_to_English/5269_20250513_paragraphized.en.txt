Mr. Lin Che-wai, General Manager and New Spokesperson of the Company, will be present at the operation briefing session for the first quarter of 2025. Please report the financial figures of the machine to everyone at the start of the meeting.

Please explain to us the company's financial and operational outlook. After that, open Q&A, the presentation screen is free to read. You can enter the question or the field below. We will wait for the reply. Again, we will remind you that all the contents of this briefing session are for reference only and not any investment advice.

Financial figures for the first quarter. In the first quarter, revenue was NT$25.100 million. In the first quarter, revenue was 32% higher than the previous quarter. In the same period last year, gross profit increased by 29%.

Increased by 31% from the previous quarter. 20% from the same period last year. Gross profit margin increased by 45%. 200% from the previous quarter. 4% from the same period last year. Gross profit was NT$63 billion.

10% higher than the previous quarter. 10% lower than the previous quarter. 30% higher than the same period last year. Business economy, at a level of NT$75 billion. 140% higher than the previous quarter. 12% higher than the same period last year.

Operating profit index, 30%. 14% higher than the previous quarter. 4% lower than the same period last year. Sales tax is NT$12.4 billion. 31% higher than the previous quarter. 38% higher than the same period last year.

Operating economy index, which is 39%. It decreased by 0.6% compared to the previous quarter. It increased by 3.2% compared to the same period last year. The rating is NT$16.39 per share.

After the first quarter of this year, the main meat products accounted for more than eighty percent of the total revenue. For example, the device products accounted for less than two percent of the total revenue. Next.

In fact, we have moved more than 100 minis for our guests. That's the change in compatibility throughout the market. That's the change in compatibility throughout the market. That's the change in compatibility throughout the market.

That's why we see more and more customers interested. I also think that the strategic direction of such a company. In the free brand and part of the foundry. In the free brand and part of the foundry. We continue to do different ways to continue to grow. We continue to do different ways to continue to grow.

So I'm pretty optimistic about the medium and long term. So I'm pretty optimistic about the medium and long term. It's also important that we want it. It's also important that we want it. It's important that we want it in PCIe Gen5 and USB 4. 0 V2.

We'll probably be going to the first generation next year. We're going to go to this FINMED process. That's what we hope to come up with more. A product that's double faster than the current speed. That's what's going on in 2026.

I hope to weight. By 2027 there will be mass production opportunities. So I think this is the next thing to say. Time is on top of the technical specifications. There is also this product. With every OEM there is a free brand on the opportunity.

There are a few reports with each investor. The media reports. That's probably what I want to say in the short term. See the first quarter. We also reflect that it continues to grow more than last year.

We didn't see any change in this direction. That third quarter we actually saw. The needs of our guests continued to increase. So I think it should look like this year was better than last year.

The new Grow engine's combine. Along with some new business opportunities for the future. There are some new package switches. The land continues to have the opportunity to weigh. So I believe we are optimistic next year. We want to do something for the future.

I think this is for the short-term and medium-term. Follow the direction of some companies in the future. There is also a plan for the product. I would like to thank you for making a report.

Then enter the Q&A. If you would like to ask, please enter the question in the bottom right of the screen. We will reply the same after finishing.

I understand that the company can't provide the digital person. I want to know if it can maintain more than 20% of the revenue. Ask the company's judgment on the second quarter's revenue and gross profit. I understand that the company can't provide the digital person. I want to know if it can maintain more than 20% of the revenue.

Want to know if it is possible to maintain more than 20% of revenue. The gross profit margin is still 50 to 55% of the difference. Currently, our April revenue is also announced. So we are in fact a new quarter of our April revenue. We do more than 1.1 billion. I think this is our first time to break through the two billions.

So I think I've seen the second quarter. Based on some of the market share gain of the current customers. We've been on the second quarter. The second quarter of the continuous opportunity to maintain this view is very confident. Of course, the changes in the currency will have some effect. I think we should still be in management.

As for the gross profit margin, it is possible. We mentioned earlier. The gross profit margin between the free brand and the wind is different. We continue to maintain a high gross profit margin on the free brand.

It's what he said to his competitors. We look at these important areas. He's close to more than 80% of the market share. That's the solution of this high-rise X-Series. In fact, it's a lot of contribution, because the X-Series is two chip plus a USB4.

That's all there is to it. Twenty-two pieces of this fortified view saw twenty-three of this business. So I think this whole of our second quarter or a fairly optimistic view. The next question is what the energy limit is for the second half. The main growth momentum comes from. The change in gross profit margins and operating expenses for the year 2025.

Will the impact of the exchange rate remain a double-digit growth throughout the year? In fact, for the second half of the year, we have this tariff relationship. It will not cause a change in the unit price after the tariffs have changed. The fear of the consumer is that it will not be affected by a degree.

That's what we're talking about in this desktop. monitor board. We're talking about our own market. The North American market doesn't actually account for the tem of the entire motherboard. It's probably one to two percent of a range. So we feel that even after tariffs have caused a change in its cost.

It may affect the scope of what can be managed. So we can still see that we are seeing ourselves in the second half of this year.

This is my client's expectation. It's more optimistic than the market. We see that Q3 is more likely to grow again. That's the direction we can now see above the order.

So the fourth quarter may be slightly revised. But the whole package still looks and feels better than the first half of the second half of the quarter. This is my current view of the second half of the year. That gross interest rate is actually part of the company's policy.

Yes, that's okay. So we will continue to use the free brand to change the gross profit margin. That second half of the merger of techpoint will also come in.

That's why we have a gross profit margin for the year 2025. It should be in one direction for everyone in the first place. The OVN part is good. I've just mentioned it for myself. There are also investments for people in the development of technology.

We also consider changes in exchange rates. I really believe that part of the US dollar must be ok. That part of the US dollar is even after considering the application of the US dollar. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided.

It is important to note that some sentences may be incomplete in syntax or have duplicated parts, but cannot be modified according to the user's request, and can only be arranged in the same way. First, I will check the contents corresponding to each timestamp in a row to make sure that there are no omissions. For example, the first timestamp is [1100. 50-1107. 50], the content is "my guests on this high-end market", and the next time it is [1107. 50-1109. 50], "continue to win the market share."

For example, on the part of NVIDIA GPUs, it may be necessary to combine several related timestamps into a paragraph that illustrates the impact of GPU shipments on the market. Similarly, on the part of talent needs, the content of multiple timestamps needs to be integrated to maintain consistency. It is important to note that some sentences may be incomplete in syntax, such as "getting more" repeated, or have a significant pause between sentences.

In addition, the user mentioned that the name of the company, need to confirm the correct spelling, but according to the original source provided by the user, should be kept the same. At the same time, pay attention to the number in the timestamp correctly corresponds to ensure that there is no error. In the process, also pay attention to the use of punctuation marks. For example, some sentences in the original text end with commas or periods, while others do not. According to the user's requirements, can not add or remove punctuation, so it is necessary to keep the original punctuation structure between paragraphs, which may need to be used to separate different themes.

At the same time, check if there are any formatting issues, such as whether the timestamp needs to be retained, but depending on the user's requirements, it may only need to retain content without timestamp. In summary, the process requires careful analysis of each timestamp corresponding content, grouping by logic and subjection, keeping the original integrity and order, while improving readability through paragraph division. Make sure that no information is missing and strictly adhere to the user's non-deleted, non-rewritten requirements.

So this is really a good way to enjoy it. And with this year's NVIDIA's 50 series of GPUs. After a lot of shipping has started, and even more has been pushed to Desktop. We see this on the motherboard.

YOY is actually growing up. That I believe is a very special direction for us over the years. So our guests are going in the right direction, so even if it is tariffs, I think that in a short period of time we have to make this revenue that is strong.

This is my current judgment. The next question is whether we will continue to expand this year. Will we still recruit more engineers?

Many of these companies have been established in Taiwan. This operation headquarters is also good. In fact, the demand for this talent is getting more and more. The more important we are, the more we will continue to invest in the good talent.

That is, the whole house. The whole period should not be with this. The issue of this tariff is caused by this reduction. We will also pay close attention because that is how we continue to recruit the people we want in the second half of the year.

But we may be looking at the full recruitment process a little further. Look at the whole project. Profitability of the company. Determine the direction of the operation. The next question is how to expect a foundry. So at this time of the project.

Whether there is any problem. Because we are now making a company. A large company. The currency of the company. The direction of the operation to judge. That is the question.

How to expect a foundry to work at this time. Is there any problem. How to expect a foundry to have a brand revenue ratio. Would you like to reduce the proportion of single error. There is no target number. In fact, this is a lot.

My clients grow a lot if they have a guest. It's not really a bad thing. That's just saying that there is a change in this proportion. I think we've been working with them for years.

That's a good time to about 60%. That's a bad time to fall to the lowest level to 39%. That's the way we all go about it. That's the way to keep the company on average. Continue to have a chance to grow in one direction. That's probably why.

Our customers' competitors. In the planning of the product. Some of the production above the problem is also the same. So caused a big change in the market. So it will also be launched.

In fact, we are the proportion of the OEM. Maybe we are going up. Compared to last year, the direction we see is actually in the direction of up. That is, of course, but there is one good thing we have to say.

In fact, in this product of the customer, we also have a company chip inside, such as USB4. 0. Even a company. This bilge is relatively high, so basically it is.

So let's look at this year's AMD I believe it should be. A relatively high number. Because they have a high level of bolus. But we also work hard. From the company's long-term development.

I'm here. We're working hard to find a second client. We're also hopeful. From a long-term development direction, I want to make the OEM to maintain about one half of this kind. One aspect.

It's probably 50 50 percent. We're in a free brand. We just reported it to everyone. Through this MMA way, it's probably a chance to buy one next year. According to them, it's about 20 billion dollars a year.

The initial number. So we will also use this way. Not only products with a high price, but also products with high gross margin. And we also through the MMA way.

That's what I want now. I don't have a number. I think the number is about half.

That's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do, that's what we do.

"We want to make sure that we have the best of both worlds," he said, "and we have the best of both worlds, and we have the best of both worlds.

The current OEM and free brand. The stock water level at Johnson & Johnson with customers. In fact, the current our customers. Because of his market share. The previous year low budget.

So far, it has been slowly until 30 percent. Even some areas have more than 40 percent. Then I believe in the whole pop night, I see myself said, they are in the whole pop night. In fact, there is not a complete fullfill.

This is what they are looking for, and what they are looking for, and what they are looking for, and what they are looking for, and what they are looking for.

These pop nights are filled up. So I think the stock is currently in stock. In the third quarter, I don't think guests are on the road. There are stock levels. In fact, it's healthy.

He is the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money, the one who makes the most money.

We have seen them in the second half of the year, but they are not in the second half of the year, nor are they in the second half of the year, nor are they in the second half of the year, nor are they in the second half of the year.

The question is now: What is the market share of foundry customers this year? How much may be the market share in the second half of the year will there be an increase in the market share.

The competitive advantage of the customer can be maintained for a long time. The customer currently has market share in the tabletop market. And the market share in the mainland. Their market share. But they themselves are from their Q1.

They will be rewarded for their good deeds, and they will be rewarded for their bad deeds, and they will be punished for their bad deeds, and they will be punished for their bad deeds.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Report of the city. It's really hard for me to say, only one direction. I think they grow at a high level is obvious. In the middle and low level, the pressure to compete will be relatively large. Because I believe that the competition won't let him support him all the time.

So they will have a lot of pressure to compete in the mid and low levels. That, but I think they have some strategy in their market. CPUs like X3D have heard that they are going to be more aggressive in a layout. That way, it is possible to drive them all the way through some of the products in Malébu.

We want them to be able to do what they want, and we want them to do what we want them to do, and we want them to do what we want them to do, and we want them to do what we want them to do, and we want them to do what we want them to do, and we want them to do what we want them to do.

The next question is whether or not the customer's upcycle will be different from the last one. The demand will not be continuous after two to three seasons to start the inventory. I think this time is not the same as the last time in 2020. I think that in 2020, they mainly because the conversion above the competition process failed to cause a shortage of capacity.

That time AeroLake came out and they only planned AeroLake refresh at the end of the year. Then they would have to go to NovaLake to have a new Socket CPU by the fourth quarter of 2026. From the market, it was thought that if this generation was fixed in the AeroLake generation, the Architects.

However, in the second half of next year, our customers also have new solutions to come out of AM6. So basically this competition doesn't necessarily have to be their market or their continued competitiveness. So I think that this growth is not the same as the 2020 competition due to the lack of delivery. I think this is not the same as the position of the first product. The second is that the architecture of the performance of his competitors is not the same as the first product.

But I'm sure I'm feeling like this is really not the same as our growth in 2020, so we believe it's going to last until next year and it's not going to end in a year or two. That's what I'm talking about right now. The next question is to ask if we have Kanazawa OEM customers. In fact, we've all been told every year that we don't want to be a customer who recently saw this ARM based CPU, and that's why we've seen this opportunity and hope that if there are any new opportunities, we'll report them with investors and the media as soon as possible.

I think that's what I'm seeing here because they have some new plans for the market. The next question is about PackySweets looking to ask PCie Gen4 and Gen5 PackagingSwitch progress target customers and why they should expect future revenue contributions. I think PackagingSwitch has always been there, just saying that we've probably been there before in Gen2 and Gen3 and this segment there, and in fact, we've seen it grow in the last year or we've seen it grow in Gen3 and it's almost a big wave of growth.

In fact, the demand is very obvious, the people from this H100 H200 to B200, in fact, you can see PCIe Gen5, a very important role played on it, of course, we are all only Procom, this 89088 to 101144 this series indominate, then I went on to probably, they will go to Gen6 direction, but I believe in the whole AI architecture, this 6-pass model, then to some night end of the IO accelerated card, it seems that there is a slow chance, so now many people can also do something, and then at the end of the night can, and then put these N6 models into some AI, some of the needs, we have seen customers already carried out, or planning, so this market, I can not be evaluated, just say we have seen such a demand, so, so 48 LAN, there may be two accelerated card, we can start to promote the next time, we will follow the next next, we will follow the new version of the company.

In the past, I have no doubt that this is not happening, they sold their products, some of these shareholders, those companies, and the U.S. Department of Commerce have no particular opinion, so I think we have almost 100% of the subscription, so this has no effect on the revenue and all aspects, so I think this is the current merger and acquisition, with you to do a new update, the next question is the question is, how many customers want to see the future of the merger, there are no more clear plans, now share, I want to think about the details or, we want this complete, then to explain it, so we see that in the current automobile market, this is two, one is the service framework, one is using ananalog architecture, the TechPoint is based on their own architecture, so we will have a lot of them to talk about this.

The following is a reordering paragraph-across script:. Converting to this different interface to make the speed and quality go up again. This is our goal at the moment. Of course, the turnover of the two markets from ADI and TI is quite large. Each report is mentioned as well. So we will continue to develop in both markets.

Of course, we still have no change in our strategy. But we will continue to work hard to improve our speed and quality. First, we put TBI on the TBI and service two price spreads of more than a dozen dollars. So I believe there are still some customers on this low level of use.

We also hope that after two or three years, we will continue to make this car's raw map a more complete practice. So I believe that this car's plan will continue to develop after the merger. We also hope that the future will be a good grow engine. So we will continue to work hard to improve our speed and quality.

The next question is whether or not the recent increase will affect whether or not the package cost can be passed on to the customer. Because the package is mostly made together, so I don't think in the short term that they have packaged many ships in the gold price from the three digits at the time of breaking. So I think it should be good now. The only thing I think of as a change to the gold price might be on the PCB.

However, since the PCB industry is not 100% based on gold prices, so there is probably a certain percentage of the changes. But I should not have seen the need to reflect our cost right now. We still have some additional questions. Here I would like to ask that the performance of the big customers in the first half of this year may slow down very well.

I have just mentioned that we see this area in the second half of the year will still be better than in the first half. So they are still actively paving their holes. The second is that they are higher in the second half of the year than AM5. So of course, this will also reflect our revenue.

So I feel like we are optimistic about the second half of the year. The next question is to ask the big customers about the percentage of revenue stations in the first quarter of last year fell between 55 and 60 between the first quarter of this year and between 50 and 55. So this is probably the current percentage. The second half may be more similar to last year.

So there may be a slight equilibrium. I think we just wanted to maintain about half of it. But this has been working on it. The question below is if you want to see the competition from China and not worry about the state of competition. I think the competition has always been there. Of course, I believe this Semi-Contact IC Design has some of its thresholds.

Because it's not just an IP that can solve the difference between this Generation. Because I want AI to see it as well. It's just that the computational power that goes along with the process has always increased it, no matter what it's going to do in the future.

So, of course, I thought competition never said we'd be afraid of competition. Because after all, I believe that ASSIGNMENT is not only a product. I want to say that in addition to this for our customers, we have USB and CETA, we have PCIe, and even we can provide Total Solution.

But anyway, we put a lot of competition with the Packy Switch in the first place. So I believe in the customer service product Deliver I believe the customer's confidence in the strong is good. So we have to pay attention. But I didn't see them really in the mass production of Sample in the market. The next question is how much the exchange rate affects the company's gross profit.

So I think the average is probably that if you count a company's value as a percent, we'll estimate it to be less than 0.2 2Percent. This is the impact we're seeing now. Of course, we'll keep going to Cost Down. This is just to say that Delta is here without Cost Down. But in the future, we'll have some control over the cost we want to make this impact to the minimum. The next question is why we want to ask the company's Q1 OPEX to be higher.

What is OPEX's direction for Q2? What is the OPEX trend this year? I think we have revenue because we just mentioned the problem of this talent competition. So the reason why OPEX's increase in our OPEX is mainly because this investment is a continuous increase in employees.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, such as [2873. 50-2878. 50], so this thing will continue to reflect on this OPEX. My task is to reorganise the sequenced sentences into consecutive paragraphs while retaining all the content.

For example, the user says, "so this thing will continue to reflect on this OPEX above" and "so I believe this" may be part of the same paragraph, because they are all about OPEX. Next, "but I think it's healthy" and "because after all, IC design company" may continue on the same topic, to explain the company's situation. Then, I will deal with the following questions and answers. For example, the sound condition of the device and the part of market positioning need to be organized together to ensure that the answers to each question are complete. For example, the user says, "please update the sound condition of the device", and the next few words are the answers to the question should be merged into a paragraph.

When dealing with technical details, such as AMD and Intel's competitive relationships, it is necessary to ensure that every argument is correctly grouped. For example, a comparison of Aerolac and X3D, and a discussion of future architectures such as NovaLake and Montdusa should be segmented to maintain logical coherence. At the same time, pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that paragraphs are arranged in line with the natural process of speech or meeting. For example, thanks and subsequent contact information at the end of the meeting should be placed at the end, forming a complete end paragraph.

Finally, I read through the whole paragraph verbatim to check if all sentences are correctly classified without omissions or errors. Make sure that each paragraph is logically clear, complete, and in line with the user's requirements. In conclusion, my steps include: understanding user needs, analyzing the verbatim structure, merging sentences, keeping the original intention and order, and final proofing to make sure they are correct. After this process, the user will receive a paragraph verbatim verbatim that meets the requirements, both retains all the original content and improves the readability.

That's why I believe this. But I think it's healthy, because after all, IC design company, our greatest asset is the engineer, so we actually take care of the future of these people. So what else is the problem? Can I update the sound condition of the device?

That 40G market is because of some of the changes that you see above the price. So I think this is what we see at the end of the device. Then some investors also asked, Pfizer they roll five four, and they are probably the biggest at the moment, so U4 products seem to have some solution. But I believe that in the short term, everyone's market is a little yielded, we're in this module, and they're in the single chip.

The next question is, is there a part of the tech point that was included in the second half of this year's revenue guidance? The second quarter was originally no, and the second quarter was not covered by the tech point, because we expected the tech point to be merged in July. However, in this month, I believe that the number is relatively not particularly obvious, but we see that the second quarter does not include the tech point much more than the first quarter's growth.

At present, we have seen more than half of their needs, we have seen that we do not have to calculate exactly how much, but because I just mentioned that they are actually two chips in the series, and the two chips are actually more than a number of percentage, which will also drive ASP and revenue growth, right? The following question is, how do I see AMD's competitive relationship with Intel Desktop CPU next year? This I'm a little bit, from my standpoint, I don't mean that I'm looking at them, from the data they have given us in the market. I just mentioned that Intel this generation is Aerolac, and Aerolac is what we see in gaming performance above behind AMD X3D. The result, of course, also reflects that I've just mentioned that they're almost higher in this gaming, and this is the first time I haven't seen in 20 years.

It's also important to note that many of us are looking at this information because they think it's really too difficult to do improvement under the existing architecture, especially that the L3 cache of the AMD is relatively large, which looks like the L3 cache will affect the performance of the latency, and it can also make the game's real heat rate, so it's possible that we see it in the gaming performance more clearly than this traditional L2 L1 effect. That said, if I just mentioned that based on this kind of judgment, AMD may still have the opportunity to continue on the X3D architecture to be at the highest level. But to NovaLake, this one is a promising change, but NovaLake time we'll see it in the fourth quarter of 2026.
