Let's welcome TSRC Chief Financial Officer Mr. Edward Wen to the conference.

I think most of my friends know that 2024 was a challenging year for petrochemical companies in Taiwan, and in such a difficult and challenging environment, the Taiwanese company still got a transcript that was expected. Revenue reached 372.1 billion yuan. This is a record high in the past 10 years. That's a 18% increase compared to the previous year.

Gross profit reached $41.2 billion. 24% higher than in 2023. Operating profit increased by $9.5 billion in the previous year to 13.80 billion in 2024, with an increase of 45%. EPS for the US stock was $1.04. That also grew by 27% compared to the previous year. 2024 is the challenging period for multiple petrochemical companies based in Taiwan.

In such a difficult environment, TSRC's financial performance was expected in 2024 over a period of time. Revenue reached a 10-year high of 702 million yuan. Up from 18% in the previous year. Up from 18% in the previous year. EPS was $1.04, up 27%.

Previous year. Next, let's look at the financial performance of the first quarter of 2025. Revenue of 103.8 billion yuan. Gross profit of 11.9 billion yuan. Net operating profit of 493 billion yuan and revenue of $150 billion. Net before tax reached 6.4 billion.

We can see from the two columns on the right, whether it is keeping up with a quarter in the previous year compared to the previous year, we can see that the financial indicators are growing more than the previous year. Such a result is mainly from the performance of the strong synthetic rubber division. We know that in the past two years, our main subsidiary in China, Shenhua, after the move in the past two years and the new factory, the first production line of his new plant was successfully put into production in the first quarter of this year.

This is why we can see a significant increase in revenue and profitability in the first quarter of this year or the same quarter. We can also see that the price difference between natural rubber and tin tin is maintained at a very healthy price difference of about $500 to $600 per ton per ton.

It provides a very good support for synthetic rubber. In addition, SSRC is another highlight. We have only one place in Kaohsiung where SSRC is currently fully sold. It has also been certified by many international first-line brand tire customers. In fact, this new energy vehicle in China is constantly growing in sales, and these brand customers have been urging to expand as quickly as possible.

The main performance of the synthetic rubber division, which must be still full of challenges in our advanced materials division as a whole, especially our U.S. subsidiary, is the operation. If the product line, SBS SEBS and this primer is the business of meal ingredients, this profit is slightly declined compared to last year. The main reason for the market competition, the product portfolio relationship, and the customer's new product delay in import and customer delay in pick-up is probably due to several reasons. The main reason for the decline is due to market competition, unfavorable product mix, delayed introduction of new product, and the SEBS customer delay is pre-buy orders. But in contrast, SIS performance is slightly better than some time last year or previous quarter. That's due to the widening product spread, and also the Q1 gross profit is beneficial from lower level material cost. So we quickly looked at the financial information of the first quarter.

That Europe is the grey part here is a more obvious drop, which is mainly because our products ACBS a large part of it is used in cars, and the European automotive industry is actually facing this peer challenge from Asia, which is a tough competition. Of course, this economic weakness in the European region is also a part of the reason. The income in the Americas is mainly from our subsidiary real estate agents in the United States, which is mainly influenced by the SIS and SES we call pre-buy pre-order.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the text snippets provided by the user and sort them into paragraph texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I will analyze the texts provided by the verb.

It looks like this part of the content may involve business performance in different regions, such as Asia, Europe and the Americas. I need to organize these dispersed sentences in logical order and may need to be grouped according to time order or theme. For example, about SIS performance, revenue in different regions, ISRP and Alarm Taishan business performance, etc. At the same time, pay attention to the mixed part to ensure that no information is missing.

For example, when referring to the Asian market, the relevant sentences can be grouped together, forming a paragraph, and then dealing with the European and American parts. In addition, it is important to pay attention to the consistency of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is correctly positioned and does not change the original intention due to reordering. For example, with regard to the performance of the first quarter and comparison of the last quarter, it is necessary to maintain the correct order of time. Finally, I will read the compiled paragraph-based verbatim text to ensure that everything is properly preserved, without omissions or errors, and that all the user's requirements are met. This includes checking if any sentences are accidentally deleted or merged, and whether the transition between paragraphs are smooth.

So, as you can see from the three major regions, Asia rank higher in terms of revenue and share. This is mainly due to our strong Arabic business. We also see AMD's business Asia slightly smaller compared to the two other regions. For Europe, revenue and so declined. We are only able to find the EU, the automotive industry is facing problems from Asia's peers. And overall European Regions economy is not expected to recover as much as possible for American, in recent years SIS is facing from low Asian costs. So, we have to do this in the first quarter. So we see this year's first quarter Taiwan is in the lead Taiwan 177 million In investment Counted last year's same period or last year Last year's same year's the fourth quarter has grown In the right we see Alarm Taishan Alarm Taishan in fact as with Shunhua After the two years of moving it is also in the first quarter of this year's time to operate It's that we can see it when it comes to profit with the same year's last year's last year's last year's it's still reduced it's mainly due to the market that we are in the same market with the real competition market.

Thanks to Edward for your help. We're very sorry. We're going to take a quick look at this, as we mentioned in the first quarter of this year that synthetic rubber is still subject to the price difference between Ting Di Creek and Ting Di Creek. We can see the blue line that Ting Di Creek changes around 1200 blocks from the end of this year, and then to about 1500, but Ting Dixi has been in high-grade so we see the gray part, this means that the price difference between the two is maintained at 500 to 600, which is a very good support for this synthetic rubber price and also a great profit for the first quarter of this year.

These prices are to some extent the highest value of the natural exercise price. These pictures show what I just said, and they are particularly powerful in our Q1 performance. So I will post these tips. Thank you Edward for the explanation.

Let us welcome Mr. Yang Jieying, Chief Executive Officer of Taiwan Elephant Company, to the next 20 minutes of speech. Thank you, dear shareholders, investors, media partners, and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the first online conference of Taiwan Elephant 2025.

Thank you for taking part in our first investment meeting this year, and we are going to launch this year. I will report here, and explain the shape of the 2025 market, as well as some major industry projects. The clouding performance in the first quarter of 2025 is solid. In the first quarter, the market actually has a lot of problems, including the fluctuations in the price of the main raw materials, the potential tariff problems, are all fermented in the first quarter, and the challenges of supply and demand.

But here, let me summarize a few key factors that prompted us to make a profit in the first quarter. This includes first, our subsidiary biochemistry, the smooth relocation of our new plant, step-by-step amplification of production, allowing us to have enough production to meet the opportunities offered to our sellers. Second, the overall automotive market in Asia, the demand for tires in the automotive market is solid, especially in the Mainland China, and the demand for tires market is very strong in the first quarter. So this allows us to have a better market operation in the first quarter because most of our business is in the Mainland China.

The key factors I've been talking about, in fact, most of them belong to our synthetic rubber business. Instead, we are on our AMD, which is the business of TPE, and the challenge is relatively large. Before that, the Chief Financial Officer also made a certain explanation for that one. Don't go deep to Proto of Proof, but consider it. We still have natural jade original and current MOR scriver to mention the natural commercial ice-cream movies with a lot of attention to the trademark thor of the house or, but what we see is that we have already been facing this condition for the Core Board of Standards to predict spending 70%.

This is how much we actually get from the vaccine to some of the national ministries of Lo toll to our chromosomes, and there are other detailed and detailed reasons for the financial performance of the first quarter. So I don't repeat these again, I just want to briefly describe some important factors. The first important factor is the smooth rise of our Xinhua facilities, the smooth rise of our Xinhua facilities and the rise of business, the rise of these smooth rise and the rise of business, our values and projects, and let us find the demand opportunities we find. Overall, the auto market and auto market in China and in Asia are very stable. These factors allow us to get the opportunity in our strong areas.

Finally, our Indian market continues to be firm and strong. If you notice that all of these factors, important factors, regarding the auto market or auto market, are not AMD's business, which requires more work, and in the case of a challenge market, this requires more work, and in the case of a challenge market, let me analyze our market for the third quarter.

We are a market for the second quarter, we are a market for the third quarter, we are a market for the second quarter, we are a market for the third quarter, we are a market for the second quarter, we expect the next quarter, and we are also a market for the third quarter.

The overall market may face relatively strong winds, especially tariff policies in the United States. For the chemical industry supply chain, with direct and indirect effects, this includes the dispersion of the entire international trade flow, and the procurement of the main raw materials we apply.

With the fluctuation of the price of the product, it will also be more intense, the whole consumer market confidence, in fact, is a relatively low state, which leads to the weakness of the entire product demand. Here you can see a very important factor,

This is the case, the whole uncertainty is high, the whole uncertainty is high, in the short and long term, the competition and the market supply is too high, in the short-term, the situation is not satisfactory, it is not so easy to ease,

These challenges are expected to continue in the second to third quarter, resulting in a lot of uncertainty and volatility, will give the project to the whole industry, will bring a certain degree of risk, and at the same time I also think.

We hope in the second half, in the third quarter, there will be a difficult drop, and we expect that the United States is not near monetary policy. In order to increase the distribution of global currency circulation,

The effects of these currencies,. will increase the quality of the currency,. In the demand of the product, and in the output of the main goods and prices,. Under such a large amount of uncertainty, we have seen this effect,

We have already seen this impact, but I would like to say, in this, this is really an uncertain factor, and the increase, and we do not expect to have a quick solution.

In order to reduce supply, and the currency on the currency competition, we continue to manage,. Expected industry fees, that is, in the second half of the time, to maintain a high level,

They are the ones who have a great deal of trouble, and they are the ones who have a great deal of trouble, so how do you deal with it?

First, we have to constantly optimize our product portfolio, and apply it. Rebalance the layout of our entire supply chain, to strengthen the operational resilience of the direction of operation, to cope with some turbulence throughout the trade situation.

We will increase, we will produce and sell, we can react, to balance, to balance, to time balance, to the fluctuation of our entire market.

At the same time, we will be careful, and control our expenses, and capital expenditures, in an uncertain environment, this is one.

Another important measure, another important measure, is the positive acceleration, the development of our medical and green tires, and so on. Special chemical products solutions.

We will speed up the pace of development, and we will make the platform to have more jumping space. Against the uncertainty, the market uncertainty, the actions that we are taking, and continue to take, to navigate through this uncertainties, First, we need to optimize our product portfolio, and adjust our replacement, our supply, in order to improve our overall trade flow, we increase our SPP, sales, production, procurement, or sometimes call SSOP, the engagement, in response to the market volatility, TSRRC has, and will continue to maintain a very important product, expenditure, expenditure, this is an area that we have done very well, and we will continue to do so, in the areas where we are going to be able to do, we will continue to improve our development, as well as well as we have the opportunity to market opportunities, and will be able to market again, if we are able to do, to do, to provide them, as much as well as well as possible possible possible, if they are available, if they are available in the competition, if they are available for themselves, if they are available for themselves, we are available for themselves, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition, we are available in the same, we are available in the same, we are available in the competition as well as well as well as well as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as well as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition in the competition in the competition as we are available in the competition as in the competition as in the competition, in the competition as we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition, we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the competition, in the competition as we are available in the competition, in the competition as we are available in the competition as we are available in the

There are some very small portions of customers sold to the U.S., but we know that PanMaterial is a relatively small proportion of revenue or profitability in the TSRC as a whole, so we think that the impact of tariff uncertainty may be greater than the tariff itself. Of course, we also discussed how the cost of these tariffs can be passed on to the customer or to the importer in consultation on the impact of this tariff increase.

That's why we decided to invest in a new production line. The investment in this production line SSBR, we have launched this whole plan, and we will build it through our deep Chinese chemical company. From now on, the whole production line is now planned to be 70,000 tons, so the location is actually in Nantong deep China. The development of the new product is expected to be in 2027.

In the past, I have been working on the development of new products that we have reported in the field of medical-grade products or other products that we have been developing in the past. This is the reason why we need to address this problem in the first place. This is the reason why we need to address this problem in the first place. In this case, the AMD business in Taiwan, we have just seen that the revenue and profitability of this country may account for about 30% of our revenue, and of course, the profit is changing every year.

We know that this real industry, like all other heavy investment industries, is a step up every year, so in this case we expect this market to completely digest the existing over supply may take another three to five years, but each product line is different, but I think the most important thing is that our own products to go up and down to avoid such competition.

Let me quickly answer, this operation of our direction, we do not do stock stocks, this is the practice, is share by bank. The most important thing, we can also just listen to us because there are many other development opportunities, we need the funds, so this is the application we apply to the funds, in addition to encouragement, we are going to develop and open up the whole profit growth.

The reason for the loss is that one of the main reasons for Vietnam's operation was to suspend the second part of his financial strategy in 2025 and I think that the second part of the financial strategy in 2025 was that we didn't have to provide this statement to the CEO. Although I didn't say that I wanted to have a more general description of our outlook for the second half of the year, the last question was probably the progress of the online legal person's move, and I believe that the Chief Financial Officer can first tell us that our revenue statement for the first quarter of the previous quarter is that we are going to start a new line, which means that I will shut down a new line in each quarter, so now in the second quarter, that the second line is gradually in the market, if it goes smoothly to the third line, the second line will close the second line, so that all three lines will join the production will be in full capacity production in the third quarter of the fourth quarter.

We will end the virtual investor conference today and thank you for your participation Please also be invited to provide your feedback on the conference We are the Web page after the zoom meeting ends Thank you.
