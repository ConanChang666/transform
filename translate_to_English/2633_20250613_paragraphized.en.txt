<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user-provided rules carefully to make sure that the user-provided rules are not deleted, rewritten, or condensed with any original sentence. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to check them verbatim to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. Next, I will look at the verbatim fragments provided by the user, and note that each sentence has timestamps, such as [0.0 00-5. 28]. My task is to reorganize these verbatimized sentences in chronological order, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentences.

First, I need to identify the speaking part of each speaker. For example, the beginning is a welcome word, followed by an introduction to the attendees, and then a presentation. Next, Mr. JIM Fangze's business overview is a report from the finance department. Each section may need to be split into different sections to maintain logical structure. During the process, I need to make sure that each sentence is arranged in its original order without any modification.

For example, when it comes to the increasing number of classes, it is necessary to organize each point and number together, while maintaining the order of the original statement. When dealing with the financial part, users refer to data such as revenue, gross profit, net profit, etc., which need to be segmented so that the reader can understand the changes in each financial indicator and why. For example, users refer to the impact of earthquakes on revenue, this part needs to be segmented separately and compared with the subsequent financial data.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to duplicate or redundant content. For example, the user has repeatedly mentioned that the annual growth of 35.1 million people is 1.8%, which may be repeated, but according to the user's requirements, nothing can be deleted, so it is necessary to keep all duplicate sentences and appropriately separated in the paragraph. Finally, check the coherence and logic of the entire paragraph to ensure that each part of the transition is natural, no syntax errors or formatting problems.

The following is a transcription of paragraphs reorganized in the original order (totally retain all the original sentences and adjust the paragraph format only):

First of all, I would like to introduce the company's meeting management team today. Mr. Wang Wei-ren, Vice President of Finance, and the manager of the finance department.

Welcome to the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation. That is. In the second quarter of 114, the online legal person briefing session. Thank you for your participation. This meeting we have been looking for.

A briefing on some of the company's operations in the first quarter of 2025. Then I think I'll ask first here. Mr. Zhang Fangze.

And he said unto me, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.

Thank you. Now I ask Mr. Jim for some explanations of what to do first. Well, let's invest in advanced afternoon tea. Next, let's talk about Taiwan high-speed rail company's operating status in the first quarter of 2025.

The current size of the high-speed rail is still one of the scales of the 12 stations and 34 operating trains. That is, in terms of the scheduled weekly schedules. The high-speed rail company increased to 1103 times a week on July 1, 2024. That was done between April and June this year.

That's what we're doing on average. We've evaluated a passenger's ride status and some changes in the volume. That high-speed rail company decided to start on July 1. That would include these 17 short-term additions for one shift. All of them are included in the regular schedule.

Then there are 8 more trips. That total will be after July 1st. 25 more trips will be added. After July 1st, this schedule will be on a weekly basis. There will be 1128 trips.

From Monday to Thursday of that week. Daily two-way shifts will range from 145. Increased to 148. Friday of that weekend. Daily two-way shifts from Sunday. That will range from 174.

Up to 182 shifts. We followed up on a regular schedule with a supply of energy. That high-speed rail company. We people through irregular overtime. And a short-term extension plan.

A service for a specific period of energy supply. Then the next briefing page 6. It is a condition of energy supply for each quarter. High-speed rail company is a departure of high-speed rail since the first quarter of 2024.

In the first quarter of 25, a total of 14780 trains were opened. That is, compared to the 14752 trains in the fourth quarter of 24. 128 more trains were added. One quarter of GOG growth was a slight increase.

0. 9% That's right, compared to the 14416 trains in the 24th quarter. That's an increase of 364 trains. The year-over-year growth of that YY is 2.5 percent.

As a result, the number of trains increased as long as the number of trains was concentrated in Nangang. A northern section to Taichung. That is why it was slightly increased by 25 million seats compared to the fourth quarter of 24. One quarter of GOG grew by 0.5%. That is, compared to the fourth quarter of 24.

That YY's annual growth is 2.2%. The main growth is from a regular schedule on July 1, 24. One is increased to 1103 shifts per week. The next is a traffic demand situation in July.

The number of passengers in the first quarter of 25 is 1983 million. That is, compared to the fourth quarter of 24th. The number of passengers in the first quarter of 25 is reduced by two days. That is why the number of GOGs in the first quarter of 25 is reduced.

GOG grew by 1.23% compared to the fourth quarter of 24. That is, in terms of the performance of an extended kilometer. In the first quarter of 25, we benefited from one person on a long-distance trip during the Chinese New Year holiday. The number of kilometres extended was 33.6 billion.

Jomo is 33.6.2 million kilometers ahead of the 24th quarter. That's an increase compared to the 24th quarter. The number of passengers increased. 35. 1 million. The year-on-year growth of YOY was 1.8%.

The annual growth of an extension kilometer is 1.8%. The annual growth of an extension kilometer is 1.8%. That is in terms of the expansion kilometer. In the first quarter of 25 years of Chinese New Year holidays, this connection occurred in Tainan and Chiayi.

The YOY word is 0.27% year-on-year. That is, in terms of seat utilisation, the implementation of regular schedules. And a measure of short-term shifts to improve the performance of a service under. Although a passenger's demand for travel is still strong. But the first quarter of the 25th century, a seat utilisation rate of 70.8% is already the same as the beginning of the 24th century.

72.5% That shows a downward trend. Then the next briefing is on page 8. It is a performance of senior companies in the last five years. In the 25th quarter of the year when it comes to operating a train, we were connected during the Chinese New Year holiday.

The average delay time for high-speed rail is up to 0.56 minutes. That is significantly higher than the average level of the past five years. The above is a description of the operation of the business we are going to ask the finance department of Yuan Binli. Let's talk to the industry first about a discussion about the financial aspect.

Thank you to Mr. Chan for the explanation of the first quarter of the financial situation.

First, let's take a look at the 10th page of the presentation. The part of the presentation that is semi-quantitative and financial. We compare it to the 4th quarter of last year.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

The earthquake occurred. The earthquake caused some of us. The lift of the lift and the cancellation of the move, I believe this part of us, even if we leave this do not talk about this revenue follow.

Last year's Q4 comparison was just a little different. As for gross profit and net profit. There were 7% 8% growth. This part was basically. He was more like a seasonal factor. This is mainly because we had some repairs in the Q4 last year.

Some expenses. There are some expenses for repairing the repair. The amount of the request will be concentrated in the 4th quarter. Therefore, the cost of the 4th quarter is caused. It will be a little higher.

But then again.

If we look at the right in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter last year in the first quarter last year, the obvious difference is not so much, the main difference will be in the price of the steady amount, this year the first quarter in the first quarter, and the first quarter in the second quarter in the second quarter of the year. That's because this part of the fee, in addition to a large part of the difference, depends on the current year's budget, then with the actual number of adjustments, so in the first quarter there will be some differences.

The income of the affiliate business is mainly from the station's advertising, the station's rental income, and some parking rentals, such as a revenue. If you see a distribution below the screen, you can see that the affiliate is basically a slight increase in the comparison of QOQ or YY. Overall, we have seen a slight increase in gross profit margin, net interest rate, and operating profit ratio compared to 24 or 23 years, representing the overall revenue performance of the first quarter of this year I believe it is a good condition.

The company's dividend distribution has been approved by the shareholders meeting on May 22, and the dividend distribution per share is 1.05 yuan, which is also passed by the board of directors in June. The dividend distribution structure is the general equity of the board of directors on August 14th, so the last account will be July 16th, the benchmark day of July 21st, and the dividend distribution date is August 10th.

In fact, I would like you to think that the advanced investment in our stocks is probably in fact, when we see that this time in April, when President Trump announced the so-called peer-to-peer tariff, the time had been a fluke in the stock market, and many of the prices on the stock market were a big drop. At that time, the company's stock was basically still a slight drop, so the overall market value of the stock was not much changed here with you report. Then please see the page 17, I think you'd like to invest in advanced people or actually want to explain what the company has in the revenue stream, I think in recent years we've also focused on a few aspects of revenue growth.

This investment is advanced, this investment is advanced, I think a lot of advanced, and even we need some investors to worry about this, so we may be more difficult to judge, but because I think the first of its spreads is what? There is a certain difference, not to say that there are 10 pieces of 20 pieces like this, but this is another word for Taiwan. It takes about an hour 40 minutes from Taipei to Taichung, but the high-speed rail Taipei to Taichung is within 47 minutes and 50 minutes from Taipei to Kaohsiung. It takes more than three hours and four hours, but sitting on the high-speed rail is only one and a half hours by car, so there is still a big difference in this time, so I believe that while Taiwan has adjusted the price, but because it is one. **Please note:**

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript: [1474. 48-1476. 78] The difference between the time of the ride is obvious, and we are very competitive in the transport of the west corridor. [1480. 10-1481. 38] So I believe that we should not be too much of a problem. [1481-1484. 98] We have a description of this. [1481. 90-1484. 98] There is a follow-up question here, is there a follow-up question is whether high-speed rail is planning to follow up the adjustment of the fare?

[1496. 54-1503. 20] The question of this fare is that we will continue to look at the status of the board of directors to establish the department, because the contract requires that we have to adjust the basis for a custom rate according to a rate announced by the Ministry of Transportation. [1519. 06-1520. 86] The announcement of a rate for the two years is indeed an announcement, and then there is an adjustment effect. [1526. 54-1531. 14] This part of the contract we may still establish the department to consider the overall assessment of the operating condition and the economic situation. [1539. 34-1542. 66] And the price of the Taiwan Railway began to rise on June 2, I think we may also observe the overall situation, and I think we will follow up the relevant units should see how to evaluate the board for a decision. [1556. 54-1559. 62]

[1572. 66-1677. 54] In the past few years, we have used our hands to pay back that money, which is a big reason why the amount of money is relatively high compared to the interest rate of the second line. [1586. 54-1591. 40] There is a relatively high interest rate condition in the hands at the time, so many years ago we had to use the corporate debt is the amount of money to repay the bank. [1601. 64-1602. 66] Because the amount of money we have taken is higher than the bank's linked interest rate, it is advantageous to save interest on a whole. [1611. 88-1614. 18] After the last year, we had an interest rate condition of the whole of the bank's bond, and now the whole of the business is basically added to 0.445. [1630. 10-1634. 46] So this bank also released a lot of this part of this part.

[1643. 68-1646. 50] In the short term, we may not do this in advance, unless the capital market or the money market they have a better condition for a situation that we have more so-called if we get the money back by this way, we will still consider it. [1670. 86-1673. 16] Otherwise, in the short term, we may basically not consider this or not to carry out a situation in advance. [1681. 40-1690. 26] This is the case with you. [1687. 30-1690. 88] The next question is to ask if there is a slight decline in business interest, and why the steady line increases. [1695. 22-1702. 40] This is the part of the way to hear a smooth withdrawal, and the basis for which he actually has to carry out the contract in accordance with the year. [1714. 94-1717. 24] However, because we have a quarterly quarterly financial reports that we will estimate that we are actually every month and therefore we will estimate that this internally.

[1734. 92-1735. 68] Or this part of course will turn out to be a situation that he will rely on most of the estimate. [1741. 88-1743. 40] So this estimate will come together with the actual number to evaluate, but there is a large part of the estimate that will be calculated in accordance with some budgets for the future year, so they will calculate how much of the quarter should be listed in this way. [1761. 84-1766. 22] So there are some reasons for the quarterly comparisons, so this may be explained to investors ahead of that, of course, because it is a relatively accurate comparison to the year. [1775. 301781. 60] It is a good thing to report with all of your investments forward. [1785. 70-1786. 2086.

[1796. 24-1797. 00] What will happen to the new car ceiling calculation period in 2027? [1797. 00-1802. 38] Is the space of the extra shift already satisfies the area? [1802. 38-1805. 20] I think this part of our company is evaluating the condition of a fixed extra shift every year because it seems that the traffic has been steadily rising in recent years, so we will continue to evaluate the extra shift at a fixed time.

[1820. 82-1822. 10] It was July 1 this year that it would be like Mr. Jin said that there would be 25 more classes. [1828. 24-1830. 30] The 25 classes here are 8 north and south. [1835. 16-1839. 26] This is mainly focused on Fridays and Sundays, and most of them are because we found that there are a few short-term visitors in the north of Taichung and some of them have this need on Sundays, because we will do some extra classes for a few of those needs in a few rush hour. [1847. 96-1849. 50] Some of them have this need because we are going to do some extra classes for a certain rush period. [1895] So the fixed increase will be basically based on the current 34 group of driver traffic.

[1920. 00-1922. 56] The big event will have some temporary schedules to stream that is the direction of the current temporary arrangement.

Thank you, Vice President. Is there a new question here, when will 12 new trains join? What is the amortization cost after joining? The plan is based on the current plan, which should be in the fourth quarter of 2026 will be sent to Taiwan. But after sending in, we still need to take half a year to test these operations, so the actual launch should be after 2027.

Of course, the part of the car must be really on line time before it starts to depreciate. It will be according to the car's internal life and the on line time to depreciate a stall.

OK. The first part of the text question is here, so let's see what else you have to ask, and welcome to use the microphone directly. What is the cost of one of the new trains and how long is his amortization? This part of the announcement we announced at the time, uh, the owner of the train, and I let my colleagues check the amount announced at the time.

I remember about 200,280 billion dollars when I was about a year old. If this is the case, the column is about 200. As for the year, basically our car, the design is basically used in all aspects of the current car, the use of that year, we basically used 35 years to decomposition. Thank you. We just count, it's probably 20 billion, 23 billion. This is the announcement that we're going to use directly from this announcement, we have to announce it in the previous year, because our contract contract is the announcement that the contract is the number of the contract, which is convenient.

If you want to know more about advanced investment, you can check out our announcement materials. Thank you very much. Well, the text question is here. Is there a need to use a microphone to ask questions? Now you can open the microphone.

I think there is no further question about the advances in online investing at the moment. Is there a place for supplemental explanations here? No, thank you. So if you have any questions, thank you very much for all the advanced participation in the investment today. The online explanation of high-speed rail will end here. Thank you again for the company's management team, and thank you all.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
