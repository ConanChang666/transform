<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

For example, the first sentence is [0. 00-5. 64], and the next one is [5. 64-9. 42]. It is necessary to confirm whether the connection between each timestamp is natural or duplicate or error. For example, in [56. 22-57. 38], online investors may need to check if there are missing sentences, because there is no content in the previous timestamp, but this part of the text provided by the user does, so it is necessary to insert it correctly. Next, I need to arrange each timestamp corresponding sentence in order and merge it into paragraphs.

For example, [12. 26-13. 96] There is Mr. Wong Ting-yi, the chairman of the board, [13. 96-15. 62] Mr. Hung Ting-yi, the two sentences should be merged into a paragraph, explaining the participants. Also, be aware that some sentences may have jumps in timestamps, such as [46. 40-49. 12] for detailed explanations, and then the timestamps jump to [56. 22-57. 38] may be missing in the middle, but according to the content provided by the user, this section is indeed present, so it is necessary to place correctly.

The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim transcription (totally retain the original content, only adjust the layout and paragraph structure):

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the leaders of today's meeting, Mr. Wong Ting-di, and Mr. Hung Ting-yi. The conference procedure today will first use the company's business evolution briefings, and then carry out the Q&A. During the presentation, if any questions are entered into the chat window, the briefing will answer your questions. We will now pass the time to the chairman of the board.

We will first make a report on the operation of the company, which will be explained in detail by our Manager Hung. We would like to thank you for your participation in today's 2025 Law Meeting. I am Mr. Hung Ting-yi, Manager of the Management Department of the company. The first half of the legal meeting will explain to you the company's profile and the current operation status, and the second part will be Mr. Huang Ting-di for the future of the company.

The information contained in the presentation may include forward-looking statements which may differ from those based on assumptions made by the Company in the future and from factors beyond the Company's control. Third, this document shall not be regarded as an offer to buy or sell securities or other financial products.

As of the end of May 2025, the company has 439 employees, the current paid-in capital of NT$18.49 billion, and the most recent year 2024 consolidated revenue is NT$2.87 billion. The spring company belongs to the industry chain, and we use the stock exchange industry value chain information platform to explain to you.

Chemicals can be divided into four categories, including PTA, interface active agents, industrial synthetic plastics, rubber additives, and so on. Chemicals can be divided into two types of general chemicals and special chemicals. The composition of general chemicals is simple, and the variety is often the basic raw materials of chemical products.

The first category is plant protection drugs, the second category is specialty chemicals, the third category is polymer plastic granules, and the fourth category is synthetic resin. The part of plant protection drugs is mainly used as pesticides for agricultural use, we mainly produce amino acids and fatty acids, which are originally sold to customers of lower oil into a variety of commercially available plant protection drugs.

Antioxidants are mainly used as the main product of anti-oxidants. Antioxidants are mainly used as the main product of preservatives, to prevent plastic products such as polyethylene, polypropylene and tin nail copolymer, polycarbonate, PS plastic, PVC, engineering plastic, rubber and petroleum products, ABS plastic and other polymer materials, can also be used as binders, natural or synthetic plastics.

The first category is TPU, TPU is thermoplastic polyurethane methyl ester, is a low polyol soft forging and diethyl ester, a linear kilometre tool composed of a low polyol soft forging and diethyl ester, a polymer expansion chain hard section, can naturally decompose in the natural environment, can be replaced with plastic products, currently widely used in shoes leaves, textiles, pipes, wheels and as a follower. The second category of polymer materials is TPV, TPV mainly by different types and proportions of EPDMPP through dynamic glue link to achieve a variety of hardness and fog, no need to undergo chemical vulcanization, so the energy consumption is low, the product has a permanent deformation, flexible bending, high tear strength, hydrolysis and thickness, can be recycled processing, commonly applied to the wire cover cover, paper sleeve, car cover, car, car, car, car and seals, etc.

27% of the products sold in 2024, followed by 19% of the plant protection drugs, and 17% of the annual coke drug revenue, followed by 19% of the plant protection drugs. In addition, the revenue of polymer products, electronic chemicals, and flame retardants accounted for about 8% to 10% of each. In comparison with the two-year product portfolio, the total revenue of 2024 increased by approximately NT$1 billion in 2023. The main projects we see above, the main growth of the program is two, the first is the plant protection drug, the second is the plant protection drug, which is mainly the plant protection drug, part is mainly because the customer obtained the pesticide license in Brazil, resulting in the continued increase in revenue in the South American market.

Some of the additives such as plastics are made by petrochemicals. The additives are all at a very severe price competition pressure. While the main softeners have a slightly refrigerated revenue this year, the consumer electronics market has now become saturated, and no cross-generational products have been on the market for many years, so the relative recovery force is not as expected.

We can see from this chart that revenues in 2024 increased by about 4.63 per cent compared to 2023. This has improved in terms of gross profit margins, which, as we have just mentioned, has contributed to the steady growth of plant protection drugs and adhesives, as well as the degradation of high-priced raw materials in the previous year, and the price of raw materials has become stable. The company has also made some reductions in yields for some uninterruptible products.

The net loss after the reduction of operating expenses is NT$44134,000. Net loss after tax is NT$4376000. The economic condition of the entire petrochemical industry as of 2025, the surplus capacity of China, is still unimproved, and the entire market above is still in a state of overpowering state.

This is the first time that we have received the announcement of the company's revenue decline. We can see that as I just mentioned in this composition, we can see that the main source of our revenue decline is the anti-oxidant part which is mainly due to the fact that they want to be able to successfully sell the petrochemical industry, which is part of the market, which is partly due to the fact that the company's revenue will fall more recently, mainly because of the fact that this is the part of the effect of the synthesis of China's capacity surplus, which is the same situation.
