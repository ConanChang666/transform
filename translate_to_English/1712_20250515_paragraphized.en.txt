Because of the above reasons, net profit before tax decreased by 1462 million. Owners of the parent company net profit of 3.3 billion. EPS 0.8 Next, we look at the profitability of the part.

Gross profit margin increased by 2.77 year-on-year. As you can see, I have a simple reference. It is the relationship between the product portfolio. Along with the increase in gross profit margin of the employment insurance business. The operating profit margin is similar to that of the net interest rate after tax.

The next part of the balance sheet. Q1's debt is 49.2%. Q1's debt has a declared distribution relationship. So it's usually Q1's debt ratio. It's slightly higher than at the end of the year.

In fact, this year's debt ratio is still down by 2.1% compared to the same period last year. The next part of the dividend distribution.

Also 2.5%. The Board's resolution is 2.5%. The distribution ratio is 100%. The yield rate is 5.9%. It has also been issued on April 16. The above is the distribution of dividends.

The above description. Thank you very much for running the wonderful presentation of the team. Next is the exchange of opinions. If you have any questions about the above, welcome to chat room features.

Write your question in the chat room. I'll rewrite your question. We've collected a few questions before. I'm here to ask.

First of all, I would like to ask the management team. The outlook for each quarter of this year, and how the gross profit and expenses can be shared. Thank you for your advance questions.

First things first. New agricultural companies do not announce financial forecasts. So the outlook for the future. According to the rules of the exchange. There is no clear explanation. We look at revenues from 1 to April.

Just mentioned. Including the whole new farm company has been around for a long time. Business projects that have been developed. There are also revenues. There are also proportions of the world. All are fairly distributed.

Then the whole revenue is also very stable. We have domestic sales. Look at this year from January to April. Revenue is quite the same as last year. If you split into smaller divisions, there is a decrease.

This is what we see in this verse: "And it shall come to pass, that in the end we shall see the glory of God, and the glory of his name, and the glory of his power, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might."

In the first quarter, the entire cost was increased in addition to the cost of independent experimentation. In fact, the cost of independent experimentation was a kind of research and development. We had shared it with you before in France.

Plant protection is needed for this industry. Around the world. Registration. With registration, there is a drug certificate. There is a drug certificate to have revenue. There is a profit.

So we have been doing it all the time. Drug registration work. Drug registration work. There is a lot of block in front. It is an independent experiment. Independent experiment in spoken words is proof.

This drug is on the soil. It has no effect on the air. It can only be marketed, so we spend a lot of budget.

So the cost of the first quarter of today has increased. It is also counted as the registration of this drug certificate. In terms of epidemic prevention, it is similar to a research and development fee. So the whole outlook for the future.

We have a stable development trend in the future. Thank you for the speaker's reply. If there are any problems in the chat room, please feel free to leave a message through the chat room function.

Thank you. Thank you for asking the most important question in the world right now. Investors need to know the most important topic. It should be tariffs and exchange rates.

Let's start with tariffs. We have a global distribution. Our global distribution is very uniform. For U.S. customers. Pure customers. Just see that it is North America.

Just inside the briefing. The whole Americas is 15%. But the fact is, if South America has our own subsidiary here. So let's break it apart. In fact, we are purely in the US revenue.

The first is not very high. The second is because it has a variety of trading conditions. In short, if the tariffs are affected.

All. So about tariffs on this topic. Since April 8th to the present. Evaluation of the entire company financially. No significant impact. Good.

This is a problem with the exchange rate. Just mentioned in the presentation. Taiwan accounts for 53%. China accounts for 13%. These two accounts for 66%. These are not related to the US dollar.

Most of them are renminbi in trading. In Taiwan, of course. So after deducting 66. Of course, there are 34% of the US dollars. Because of these US dollars, we sell out of the US dollars.

However, our incoming goods are also priced in US dollars, so we have to pay in US dollars, so this is explained above. So, please explain above. Thank you.

Thank you, if you're moving forward, there's no further question, we're here to tell you a paragraph.

Thank you very much to the management team of Shun Rong Co., Ltd., and thank you for your participation. Thank you for your certification.
