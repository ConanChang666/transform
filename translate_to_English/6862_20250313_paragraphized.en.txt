Thank you for setting up the general public welfare securities meeting today. Today we invite you to come and talk with us about the three-level KY companies of the anime company. In fact, when I first saw that they had announced last year's operating conditions, the revenue of last year was about 20 percent, Maori was still more than 4%, EPS has more than 11, so we look forward to the operation results of 2024 and future development plans, and the future revenue should be our investors can expect.

We are in 4 pieces in 2022, in 2023, 4. 1, 2024 we are expected to issue 6 pieces of equity. The return on equity of shareholders is 23. 67, 23. 43. We have increased the number of employees in Taipei, probably 62 people, Suzhou factory is 665, Dongguan factory is 167. During the period of operation, you can see that we are 15.24 billion at the time of 2021, then 2022 is because of the adjustment of customer stock, stock during the epidemic period, so it is only 13.24 billion in 2022, but in 2023 we have to grow to 15.94 billion, then the growth of our growth in 2024 is relatively large, up to 22.24 billion, probably one of the 37. percent.

That is to say, a portion of our net profit before tax is basically a growth every year. So the net profit after tax is 3.23 billion in 2021, then 3.43 billion in 2022, then 3.92 billion in 2023, and 5.1.5 billion in 2024. So from 8.08 in 2021, 8. 26 in 2022, 9.02 in 2023, and 11.11 billion in 2023, we have reached 11.11 billion in 2024, I think this is probably a pretty close relative to the previous legal person's estimate.

The total net interest rate, in 2024, is Q1 27. 63, Q2 24. 51, then Q3 is 17. 23, then Q4 is 25. 36, then a net interest rate part of our entire year reached 23. 43. Then look at the total amount of our assets, from December 31, 2021 this is 16.86 billion, this is 16.86 billion, then until 2024 we have reached more than 39 billion, we have reached a total of 500 million. Then the whole of this important financial ratio: we are 122.5 days in 2021, then we are 122.5 5 days in 2022, then 125. 89 in 2022, then 127. 56 in 2023, then we came to 130, I think that this electronic industry is a part of the current state of our electronic industry.

The ROE part was 19. 98 in 2021, then the 2022 was 19. 87, then 2023 was 17. 18.



The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcription:. So-called a power series. One of the power modules, TLVR. TLVR is a product we often hear. Then we have the traditional is this FairWide. FairWide is a composable, one of TLVR's inductors.

So we also put pressure on the TLVR to replace the traditional TLVR. The two TLVR products, I just wanted to say this part of FairWide, the core of such a one. One of this TLVR, it belongs to the hard-bog. So we put pressure on this TLVR's product, it belongs to the soft-bog.

Hard Baoge is OK when you are the power that the current has reached a certain degree, its inductance is very slow. So at this time you may light up. So in the server, a high-level server AI server, it will worry about these things. So this includes this N company, it is why it is used for most, one of the products it uses on the AI server, it belongs to the soft Baoge part.

So we've developed a TLVR that's all in one form. So it can bring an excellent performance because I just said TLVR, which means that when your current is the same as 80A, it may not be more than the inductive value of the traditional TLVR. But if it's a press, the TLVR is a form of TLVR, and it's an inductive value can still be 70% of the senses.

So now we have started to take orders including 6x6 8x8 10x10 10x15 part. At the moment, we are still still sending samples. Then there is a car on top of the audio inductors that basically two series we basically have started small batches of orders. Then a common mode of inductance in the car is basically that we have started a small batch of shipping. So in the future, we just said that the server AIPC also wears the market micro one grinding inductive development. So we have two sizes at the beginning, but recently we have increased to four sizes.

So the future is in addition to some traditional parts of the market server AIPC, then I said in the future that we will add a so-called wear a market includes a robot in the market. So the products that we have now developed are those that we may not be in contact with in the past or that we have not had this product in the past.

Then again, one is the development of high-performance inductors in the AI market. So I think that in this part we have started to gradually began to ferment, which means that the customer is not enough high-performance inductors for us to the current power supply of a development power module is basically because it is able to improve the power density and reduce the design of a size.

So I would like to start this third quarter or the fourth quarter in the future, there may be some goods that are already being delivered to the customer. Then again, one is a high-power vehicle of a part of the car charging. Then this part we have developed 2. 5kW to 6. 6kW high-power vehicle of a charger charging terminal part of a charger includes a PFC inductor LLC of a concerted inductor transformer, etc. Basically, we have started to ship in small quantities. So we are also waiting for a large number of production of customers when we can receive more inductors.

But in the past two years, we have begun to invest in the research and development of this person and some of the equipment we have developed. So we have started to have a small success. So let's take a look at one of our automation equipment, which added some of the equipment we have in the past two years, including a high-density abrasive inductance. So this is our old equipment, the two years are all Mars products.

This is a part of the TLVR that contains these so-called parts of the car. Our new workshop is in production. This is also the future. I think we are in the future.

There is also an electric vehicle part on the side. In fact, we are talking about the electric car part. From last year. A little more than one percent. We should grow this year. More than 5 percent.

Growth is the part of the car. Even if we have a total revenue. Should have more than 5 Percents. Because this includes ADAS. The charging pile is the same. This USB-VM cable.

It's part of battery management. Then it's part of artificial intelligence. We're the future. It's now in the layout.

There is a market to be developed. A product to be worn in a smart home. There is also a machine product. This whole revenue is a dynamic. There is another.

I think this is one of the benefits of this. Everyone is also more concerned. So we have a vision of 2025. In this section, we talk about our business. Continued one. Expansion is just as I said.

Contains a market for wearing. Contains a market for robots. Contains a part of a smart home. I think this part should have. There should be some development time. So we have a grinding inductor.

That's why we expect a revenue from 2025 to be better. I think in 2024. We're in January and February. One performance has already been announced.

Please, I think you should. You can refer to it, and then add our capacity. Constantly increasing us. An economic scale of automation is expanding. So.

So our revenues are up to date. I think the gross profit rate should be, and that's time to go back to a traditional server. The TLVR inductance of the Lord's special TLVR. We've already started.

Mass production has only been shipped. So we don't just target it. International manufacturers also include the right. This is the so-called Chinese companies. Also the server manufacturers. We are also in the process of moving forward.

We have begun to deliver. And gradually in the promotion. That grinding pressure is a TLVR. We are now starting to send samples. Customers who may need it. That is to change or change the size.

Some of us are now. Extremely cooperating. That AIPC. There is also one of the inductors used on the notebook. A micro-modi we now have. The beginning is continuing to add us.

A size. A size of one size and one of it. Equipment is expected to start in the third quarter this. Four sizes commonly used specifications. A four size should be.

It should be possible to start a gradual shipment. Then the original. 325 2520 is a part. It has begun production. It has begun in the delivery but I am the one. Some of us are now increasing.

The last one I've added is a size. A size. A size of about 10 KK. I think it should be in the third quarter. It should be official. Mass production so.

The quantity of orders will continue as well. One of our messages is AIPC, which includes Notebook.

The server is already on top. Start playing miniaturized one. A micro power inductor. Used. Then another is an audio in the car. An empty inductor is also USB.

And one of them is the one who has the power to do so, and one of them is the one who has the power to do so, and one of us is the one who has the power to do so.

There is a lot of revenue and profit. It is a big contribution. It is one in the server UPS. This is a big power. A part of the active inductive BPU.

For us. In 2025, revenue and benefits will be increased. It should also be improved. Finally, the AI server power supply. The magic in the module also comes with a lot of us.

Fintech ICs and power plants. In cooperation with the development, so they continue to send samples or. They have begun in small batches of one. So we think it is. In the second half of 2025.

He should bring one. A new revenue. It is now possible that we can really have a fermentation in 2026. That is the end of us.

He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is.

31 of the total revenue. 31 more than one. The future of our target will be 3 out of 5 by 2025. The above can even come to the market.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-generated copy-paste fragments and convert them into paragraph-based copy-paste. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all sentences must be retained, and the format of the original copy-paste should be sorted into readable paragraphs.

First of all, I read through the entire transcription fragment to understand the general structure and theme of the content. It looks like this section involves the company's outlook on 2025, including the application of AI servers, the update of charging business, and questions and answers about the interest rate. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical paragraph for reasonable segmentation.

In the process of processing, it is necessary to pay attention to repeated sentences, such as "there is another update for the charging business" appeared twice, and must be kept. At the same time, some sentences may appear duplicated or lengthy because of oralization, such as "this part of the server first" and "this part of the AI server first", which needs to be merged or adjusted structure to make the paragraph smoother. In addition, the portion of the insurance interest rate question mentioned by the user, containing multiple questions and answers, needs to group relevant questions and answers to ensure logical coherence. For example, the reason for the continuous decline in the insurance rate and the expected stabilising time, as well as the middle and long-term target range, these should be attributed to the same paragraph.

At the same time, when dealing with duplicate sentences, it may be necessary to use a connection or adjust the structure to make the content more consistent, but the original sentence content must be kept strictly. Finally, I will read through the entire finishing paragraph verbatim to check if all the original sentences are properly preserved, no omissions or errors, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, in line with the user's requirements. Make sure that no modification or condensation is made, and it will be organized entirely according to the content of the verbatim text provided by the user.

The first part of a server, the first part of this part of the AI server, because we put the AI server and the traditional server together, just a high cloud a high budget, just a high cloud a high budget, and there is a cloud a budget. Basically we put it together, so the whole of the car, I think it should be more than 30%, I think it should be more than 30%. This is probably more clear that we should be. The other part of the charging dedicated part, the other part of the charging dedicated part, because we started small batch, but I think this future, it should grow.

In fact, in the past two years, our company for the server and AI a part of the server, our company actually for the server and AI a part of the development of a new product development, including the traditional TLVR, then we also with the customer to do a special development, then we also with the customer to do a special development, then there is another part of the TLVR, then I just said AI, the AI of the minimotive micro induct, AI of the minimotive micro induct, there is a high-density one high-density power, there is a high-density one high-density power, there is a high-density one high-density power, size relatively large, including 10cm 8x8, these are actually in the server also began to reference, so three classes of a new market, basically in response to these so called a new market, three-level market, we have a new market, a new market, there is a new server market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is also a new market, there is also a new market, there is also a new market, there is also a server a server a server a new market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is also a new market, there is a server a new market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is a new market, there is also a new market, there is a new market, and there is a new market demand demand demand demand demand demand demand demand demand demand demand, and we are three, and we are three, the three, we have a new year, the three, and we have a third, we have a new year, we have a new year, the year, the year, the three, the three, the three, we have a competition competition, we have a competition competition, we are, the three, the year, and we are, the three, we have a competition competition competition competition competition competition competition, we are, and we are, the year, the year, the year, the three, the three, the three, the year, we have a competition, we are, the first, the three, the year, the year, the year, the competition, the year, the competition, the year, So this is because of a customized product, some of our peers do not want to do it, because he does not know when an automation investment can be recycled, but we because of the automation of a very large investment in our conversation, we can do some so-called change or say that, so when I do custom products, I began to think about automation and design, so when I started to design this product, I thought that we can not automate production, can not share this set of equipment with the same size, so we spent a lot of time in this part of the time, of course, the customer see our listing after the Maori is so high, then will not ask us how high, of course, so it is necessary to cost time, this is actually speaking, whether it is not Maori, the customer after seeing you feel that you are very high, or even every month, there is a need to do a new product, and we will be a new product, because it is a new product, and we will be a new product, and a new product, because we will be the only a new product is a product, because we want to ask a new product, and a new product is a product is a new product, and we will be a new product, and we will be a new product, because we will be a product is a new, and a new product, and a product, because we will be a new product is a new product is a product is a new product is a product, and we will be a new product, and a new product is a new product is a new product, and we will be a new product, and we will be a new product, and a new, because we will be a new product, and a new, and we will be a new product, because we will be a new product is a new product is a new product is a new product is a new product, and we will be a new, because we will be a new, and we will be a new, and we will be a new product, because we will be a new, and a new, and a new product, and we will be a new product, a new product, because we will be a new product, and a new, and a new, and a new, and a new product is a new product, and a new product is a new product is a new product, and a new product, because we will be a new product,

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim: Can you achieve such a feature? That's why we're happy to work with customers how to do so. So we started the R&D team to start OK. The size of the mold you want to reduce, you want to develop. So what part of the material is to reduce a size, after that area, the functional part can not meet the customer's one requirement.

So for the middle class part of a gross interest rate, we feel like to say, I'm constantly how, to increase the development of my new product. So we continue to go, this is the one to look for, this more difficult these inductors, the industry is doing less, such a one. This kind of industry, then we do some so-called development in this regard. So we also have a, we are developing is a material of our application. Receiving inductance basically to the end, who is the material, who is the design leader, then who is a part of a characteristic power, efficiency part can meet the customer's requirement.

So, let's say we are ahead of the industry, we are ahead of our other competitors. Then I believe that is the customer, if we say a little price, the customer is also able to accept. The key is that these customized products, you can not use automation in a way that can reach the customer, as scheduled, a delivery deadline.
