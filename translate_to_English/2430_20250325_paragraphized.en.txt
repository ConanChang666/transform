<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided copy-paste fragments into paragraph-paste transcripts. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that the user understands the sentences corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the order and content of the original text must be maintained.

First of all, I will check the sentences corresponding to each timestamp to confirm that there are no omissions or errors. For example, there may be some timestamps in the user-provided script, such as [470. 82-473. 12] mentioned "material", which may be a typographical error, but the user requests not to modify the content, so it is necessary to keep the original. Next, I need to arrange these sentences in chronological order and organize them into a consistent paragraph, while maintaining the integrity of each sentence.

In the process, I also need to pay attention to the correctness of the punctuation and format, to ensure that each sentence ends with the correct punctuation, and that there is a proper line between paragraphs. At the same time, the user may want the final paragraph punctuation to be easier to read, so it is necessary to take reasonable segmentation to avoid long paragraphs. Finally, I will read the whole finishing text, check whether all sentences are properly arranged, without omissions or misplacements, and ensure that all user requirements, in particular, do not modify anything.

Well, that's what I'm going to tell you about, probably a March 2025 legal meeting. One of the key points of a presentation today is that it is divided into four main areas. The first one is a key point of a financial statement in 2024, and the second one is an overview of an operation in a retail store, a distribution of a general store.

In Taiwan, there are two investment companies, which are 100% invested, and the other is a permanent investment that is 100% invested. There is another one on the right hand side of the company, Tan Kun, which is a company that is 100% invested by Chun Kun Industrial. Here we are a holding through a BBR of a ProWorld. That is the overall investment structure of the company, and all of the investment companies are 100% held by a company. OK The next page is the current one, the company is a distribution of an entire exhibition store in Taiwan.

This year, the total number reached 294. The 294 is mainly distributed in the north one of the 87, the north side of the 46, the central area of the 55, the south side of the 47, the south side of the 45, the east side of the 14.

The cost of operating costs has also reached 161 million, and the operating gross profit margin is about 28.600 million, the operating gross profit margin is about 15.06. The cost rate is about 25.75 billion, compared with the same period last year 26.24, the cost rate here is a slight decrease. The main thing to mention is that we have a distribution of electricity, although compared to the same period last year, but the company here is a relative decrease in revenue. The main reduction will come from a sales staff in the store, the main part of which will come from a sales staff of a relatively small salary of the store.

The operating profit rate for that year was 2.8.5 billion and the same as last year's $3.57 billion, which is about 20% less. The main reason for that decrease is that it regressed to a business income, which was about a 1 billion loss compared to the same period last year, about 5%. The net profit of that year's net profit was about 2.33.6 billion, compared to the same period last year's 3.3.53.

The cash portion of that cash is called a small increase compared to the same period last year. The cash portion is called a small increase. The cash portion is called a 13.7, and the stock portion is about 24.5, and the total asset is about 138.44 million. The total debt is mainly a payment of a supplier's money by the flow of retail. The debt is also about 28.46 million, which is about the same as the same period last year.

OK, so here's what I'd like to say, it's a matter of 2025. That 2025 outlook, the company will continue to make a showroom, that showroom will continue to make a showroom, that showroom to talk about retail is because sometimes there is a regional and regional population of a transfer, the company here will only make a new showroom for this regional change.

OK, this page is probably an overview of the company's cash incentive in the past four years. The column on the left side of this column can be seen that this is probably an EPS in the past four years. It is a distribution rate with the company's overall cash incentive in the last four years. It is the one on the right side of this perspective that maintains a cash incentive in the past four years.
