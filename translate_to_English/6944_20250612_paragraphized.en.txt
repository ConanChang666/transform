We would like to thank you for your participation in today's Fubon Investment Forum. It is our pleasure to welcome you today. Zhao Lin Industrial Co., Ltd.'s management team.

Thank you for investing in advanced. Take control of Lenin in white. A spell club on the side of Zhao Lin. Of course, today is our spell club. It is the venue of Leverage Fubon today. Because the topic of Fubon is today.

HAI's new business opportunities. That's why we're not going to Leverage this AI. Recently, we have a colleague called Ecolab. Ecolab is a European company. It's a very large company. There are about 30 billions.

It was a great company. It was his CEO upgrade. He said he was the Chairman of the CEO. Then he said he was working on Chemical water treatment. Then they were all AI-based.

The day will come when the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, and the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, and the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, and the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, and the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, and the word of the Lord will be fulfilled.

So basically all of this is automation. It is in the process of this automation. This is the role that can be played in AI. In fact, I think everyone is still looking at it. This is a hot topic, of course.

Our financial situation in the first quarter. Well, that's because the second quarter hasn't been revealed yet. That's why there are probably a lot of QA questions ahead of time. I might also want to keep a little more time for you to ask questions. That's the answer to everyone's questions.

I'm going to start brief today. Because there are so many new friends today. So I might have to say, what do you do with your face? Otherwise, everyone will be a little confused. Is this the next page?

Good POWER. Sorry no. Ok cheers can't see it. OK, so maybe I'll introduce the company a little bit. Because there were a lot of old friends last time.

Our first quarter of the situation. We don't know what we're doing. Well that's basically what we're going to do on May 28th. Well that's May 28th. The company is mainly engaged in the pure wastewater engineering in high-tech plants.

Well, that's our main job right now. Well, that's our company staff. Well, about 1100+. Well, these 1100+ are actually the main workers. That's the design of the factory. Well, that's the design section of the project.

Then included the drawing of the works. Then it came to the construction supervisor of the construction section of the public security. Well, this is all the staff we look at. Well, there must also be after the whole plant is covered. Our staff arrived at the site to do service. Well, this is also our staff.

Well, they look like a lot. But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different.

But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different. But work in a factory is very different.

These people are mostly our subcontractors. They are all our subcontractors. So we have a large project. The number of workers in a day is about 700 to 800. The number of workers in a single site is 700 800.

So let's share with you again. Our company's location. So just mentioned our one page project to talk about. The main thing is to do the whole section of the project. Because the business of the section of the project is to follow the owner's capital expenditure to go.

The owner's capital expenditure is inside. Always go to build a plant first. Then build a plant after the plant is completed. Now the high-tech plant needs. Clean room. So he needs a clean room.

After the clean room. He needs a water system. Because the equipment may be privately made. It may be a recycling system. So he has a water system.

He also has a chemical system. If he needs it in his process, there are some blood agents. There are these chemicals. He also needs the system of these chemicals.

We call the system a utility system. Those systems go in. It also needs to be recycled. That's in a high-tech plant. It has a recycling system called these chemical. Because it wants to be recycled.

So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbiage:. He may become the relationship between recycled water and recycled water. He may become the relationship between recycled water and recycled water. He may be considered as a cost of recycled water and recycling water. So this part is a long-term direction.

This is part of the process. That is why in the engineering phase, we will first talk to the customer about the plan. The customer will tell him what kind of water to achieve. Because the semiconductor plant has the water quality requirements of the semiconductor plant, your board plant has the water quality requirements. Then the packaging plant has the water quality requirements of the packaging plant and the water quality requirements of the PCB.

It's like you're planning a car, or you're developing an electric car, or you're developing a gasoline car. The concept is to first define your needs clearly. After the definition is complete, we start to design it. Well, so our design is based on your definition. So the decision of the scope is to plan the scope, and then we follow your scope to draw this picture.

Now it is drawing to autocad 3D. Now it is robovipins. Basically you can calculate the flow of your water quality and the pipes inside it, and the flow of your pump. So the drawing will be more and more accurate. The more accurate you are, the easier it will be to build the drawing later. So the drawing and construction are basically linked to the back end.

The construction part is, most of the subcontractors have been working with the face for about ten years. Therefore, their works are also familiar with the owner's needs. Therefore, the relative failure rate or error rate or cost will achieve a certain advantage.

So functional acceptance is that I have reached the standard of water quality that we need to achieve a confirmation point on both sides of the water quality. So when I get the thing I cover, you have to test the car first. You test the car, you have to get the full response. You can't say that I tried it out a little today, so the water quality is very clean. You are very clean, of course, you have to test it out. So you have to turn around.

Your water quality is getting dirty after the full turn. After the test, the system is recovered after you have not met your standards. So after the test, we need to get back to the laboratory to test. After the test, our report tells us how much water we can handle does not exceed the amount of pbb or more ppm.

So this cycle actually takes a lot of time. So the back end part is that sometimes a factory acceptance takes about two or three years and is still in the process of acceptance. But the previous paragraph was completed about a year to a year and a half ago. Of course, the relationship between our project amount is not possible to wait for the customer after the acceptance, so this part of the industry is too hard.

That other customers sometimes pay a deposit in the previous paragraph. Pay a prepayment. This prepayment sometimes takes between 10% and 20%. Then the prepayment goes to this place, and most of the work pays about ninety-nine percent.

So about 90% of the money was collected back in front of me. After that, it was about a long time to accompany him. Then the final payment was completed. So this part is what we are talking about at the moment. Then the engineer's service process.

The service part is that the factory built the house has been lided and started working. After the operation, it is the water system, of course, there is also a clean room system. The clean system is actually less service. So you see other clean room companies, it is less service type in this section. But the water system part refers to this service category more items.

What's the project. The first is the water system's operation service. It's your system that needs to go through the handler 24 hours to monitor your water quality. The water quality should be where to go. It's because it's dynamic. It's not a SOP.

It is dynamic. That is, the amount of water to get where it goes. The amount of water to get where it goes. So it is online water to monitor. So it just said that the service at the end of the AI is a lot of control in the part of the factory. So this part is part of the water system.

The second part is that the equipment may have to upgrade with upgrade, it may be necessary to optimize or add new equipment. So here we also have the so-called industry called secondary pipes. The secondary pipes actually have a lot of companies in the country to do the same.

So the part of this renovation is about the second pipe. Then there is our laboratory testing. Laboratory testing that we will not charge if it is at the end of acceptance. Then if it is at the back end of the test we will charge. There will also be some laboratory costs when we do some testing for our customers. And then there will be supplies for this water system.

This is what we need to do to make him recycle. That is, recycle is what I want to do to get him back to clean. Just like in these things, there are MD membranes with the MD membranes with the quality of the RO membranes that are related to these water systems. So the data of these consumables that we have cleaned will be returned to the owner after I told you to wash this stuff back to the original standard value and I will get you back to you.

That's why most of our consumables are made up of parts that will be replaced by cleaning. This part is more inevitable. Of course, some consumable replacements are something that he might have to replace some consumables like the second one.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

For example, when the speaker begins to discuss different topics, such as moving from the consumables section to the service section, or from the chemical classification to the coolant recycling, these places may need to be segmented. Next, I need to identify the logical relationship between each sentence. For example, the user mentions the relationship between the consumables and the regeneration section, and then it is the long-term nature of the service section, and then the classification of the chemicals.

Similarly, parts of the coolant recovery and AI may require a separate segment, as they involve different application scenarios. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps. Each timestamp corresponds to a sentence, but paragraph-based finishing requires a continuous combination of relevant sentences, while retaining the timestamp. For example, sentences from [857. 38-860. 38] to [866. 38] are discussing the relationship between consumables and regeneration and can be combined into a paragraph.

In addition, the "most important rule" mentioned by the user cannot delete anything, so it is necessary to ensure that all the sentences are included even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant. For example, in the classification section of chemicals, the user mentions different types of chemicals multiple times, all of which need to be retained in the paragraph. During the processing process, I need to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural while maintaining the order of the original. For example, when discussing from chemicals to recycling, a transition sentence may be inserted, but according to the user's request, nothing can be added, so it can only be achieved by segmentation. Finally, check if there are missing sentences or wrong timestamps arranged.

For example, make sure that all sentences about the recovery of coolant are correctly classified into the same paragraph, while the financial situation is a separate segment. After completing these steps, I will read the whole paragraph verbatim again to ensure that all the requirements of the user, especially the integrity and order of the original are maintained, while making the content easier to read. </think> [857. 38-860. 38] So this section will be part of the linkage. [860. 38-862. 38] But not the absolute relationship. [862. 38-866. 38]

[866. 38-868. 38] Of course, the price of consumables is relatively high. [868. 38-870. 38] The revenue contribution is also relatively large. [870. 38-872. 38] The service is a long time. [872. 38-874. 38] That's what I've always done for you to wash things. [874. 38-876. 38] The raw material is derived from the consumables. [876. 38-882. 38] The part of the consumable is then we enter into the 5nm.

[882. 38-886. 38] It is slowly derived from these chemical. [886. 38-890. 38] The chemical used in a semiconductor industry is divided into two parts. [890. 38-892. 38] is a chemical used in processes. [892. 38-897. 38] It is like a lot of Fleeting these pet industries. [897. 38-899. 38] They are imported. [899. 38-902. 38] These chemical used as agents for importation.

[902. 38-904. 38] This piece is for process use. [904. 38-905. 38] What is the other piece? [905. 38-907. 38] is a water system related chemical. [907. 38-912. 38] The chemical used in the water system is basically to maintain the optimization of your system. [912. 38-914. 38] Reduces the scale of your system. [914. 38-916. 38] Reduces its removal rate.

[916. 38-919. 38] Reduce wear damage. [919. 38-920. 38] or include these. [920. 38-921. 38] There are some possibilities. [922. 38-925. 38] Drying will affect some ROs. [925. 38-930. 38] I first use some chemicals at the front end to lay it down, etc. [930. 38-933. 38] or H2O2.

[933. 38-935. 38] Because it has strong oxidative agents. [935. 38-93. 38] Affects the back end consumables. [937. 38-943. 38] Let's first restore them by using the chemical method of the potion. [943. 38-947. 38] This time the drug added is the chemical that we are selling. [948. 38-952. 38] But our chemical is basically a powder-like thing. [952. 38-953. 38] The concept we have chosen.

[953. 38-955. 38] That is to say, I bought these. [955. 38-958. 38] These are the original ingredients. [958. 38-960. 38] Then I formulated it again. [960. 38-962. 38] What happened after the distribution. [962. 38-965. 38] Because basically we talked to our customers. [96. 38-966. 38] We are functional acceptance.

[966. 38-970. 38] So how much do you want to achieve. [970. 38-973. 38] Our system can test that ingredient. [973. 38-979. 38] So we can achieve the most cost-effective ratio. [979. 38-980. 38] Because we all know it. [980. 38-981. 38] Powder is relatively cheap. [981. 38-983. 38] ingredient is more expensive.

[983. 38-996. 38] How much is the ingredient. [986. 38-993. 38] 35% is effective or 33% is effective or 30% is effective. [991. 38-993. 38] This is different from the chemical of that bottle. [994. 38-996. 38] In this section, we talk about it. [996. 38-1000. 38] We focus on the ratio of ink to this so-called form. [1000. 38-1002. 38] So we have to adjust this section.

[1002. 38-1005. 38] and then supply it to our system. [1005. 38-1008. 38] This part is part of our backend service. [1008. 38-1010. 38] service. [101010. 38-1013. 38] It is a bit of a steady growth every year. [1013. 38-1016. 38] Of course, it follows the project's revenue. [1016. 38-1019. 38] There are different types.

[1019. 38-1022. 38] That's why today's topic is AI age. [1022. 38-1025. 38] So we just had a match with our customers recently. [1025. 38-1029. 38] The so-called recycling of cooling fluid. [1029. 38-1032. 38] The whole AI system is now divided into two. [1032. 38-1034. 38] One is a water-cooled air-cooled room. [1034. 38-1036. 38]

[1036. 38-1038. 38] Of course, the air-cooled room has nothing to do with anything at all. [1038. 38-1040. 38] The water-cooled room part. [1040. 38-1042. 38] becomes a water-cooled room system. [1042. 38-1046. 38] It has a cooling liquid behind the cabinet of the server. [1046. 38-1048. 38] The cooling liquid part. [1048. 38-1051. 38] Most of them are like fluoride.

[1051. 38-1053. 38] is the same as those of the cooling mediums. [1053. 38-1055. 38] Most of them are fluoride. [1055. 38-1058. 38] This is basically after your system is running. [1058. 38-1060. 38] It has been running in the pipeline for a long time. [1060. 38-1062. 38] It is getting dirty. [1062. 38-1065. 38] You are dirty to a certain extent.

[1065. 38-1068. 38] is the same as the cooling water of the car. [1068. 38-1070. 38] is the final discharge. [1070. 38-1071. 38] is put away. [1071. 38-1073. 38] and add a new coolant into it. [1073. 38-1077. 38] This is the current system. [1077. 38-1081. 38] is the cooling liquid system turning in the condenser.

[1081. 38-1082. 38] After a long time. [1082. 38-1084. 38] Heat up and start blowing up. [1084. 38-1086. 38] Cool down and go in. [10886. 38] That's why it basically starts. [1088. 38-1090. 38] Long time will turn yellow. [1090. 38-1092. 38] Corrosion these pipelines.

[1092. 38-1095. 38] What we do is what we do. [1095. 38-1098. 38] We are basically inside its system. [1098. 38-1099. 38] Divided into two pieces. [1099. 38-11010. 38] One is inline and one is offline. [11010. 38-1102. 38] Currently it is offline. [1102. 38-1105. 38] The customer needs are not yet so big.

[1105. 38-1107. 38] So basically we do the offline. [1107. 38-1109. 38] That is basically what you say about the water quality. [1109. 38-1112. 38] What we are in the process of monitoring. [1112. 38-1113. 38] So that the water quality needs to be replaced. [1117. 38-1118. 38]

[1118. 38-1120. 38] Let's take it out. [1120. 38-1122. 38] Take it out. [1122. 38-1125. 38] Do reclame in our system. [1125. 38-1126. 38] Make reclame in our system. [1126. 38-1128. 38] Let it remove the impurities in it. [1128. 38-1129. 38]

[1129. 38-1132. 38] [1132. 38-1133. 38] [1133. 38-1134. 38] [1134. 38-1136. 38] [1136. 38-1138. 38] [1138. 38] [1138. 38] is similar to the current concept of water.

[1140. 38-1142. 38] It is the water system. [1142. 38-1143. 38] The water is treated. [1143. 38-1144. 38] After the treatment is completed. [1144. 38-1146. 38] The water is recycled. [1146. 38-1147. 38] Otherwise you do not treat it. [1147. 38-1148. 38] The water is discharged.

[1148. 38-1151. 38] So this part is about cooling liquid treatment. [1151. 38-1152. 38] And recycle. [1152. 38-1153. 38] So now we talk about it. [1153. 38-1156. 38] AI7 is more and more water-cooled. [1156. 38-1158. 38] So it becomes a cooling liquid. [1158. 38-1159. 38] Also this problem.

[1159. 38-1161. 38] The coolant you're not going to recycle. [1161. 38-1163. 38] You're going to throw away. [1163. 38-1165. 38] You're going to throw away. [1165. 38-1168. 38] You're basically going to cause ESG problems. [1168. 38-1170. 38] When you buy these chemical products.

[1170. 38-1171. 38] You buy these refrigerants. [1171. 38-1173. 38] This is also an ESG problem. [1173. 38-1174. 38] So it turns out. [1174. 38-1175. 38] In fact, our recycle. [1175. 38-1177. 38] This can be achieved. [1177. 38-1179. 38] It is relative to coolant recycling and reuse.

[

In addition to these advanced packaging plants or these FAB, this will be the revenue of the project, and then of course the revenue of the project will be compressed to the proportion of the revenue of the service, so the revenue of the service is actually growth, but the proportion of the service will be relative to the project's compression, so the service ratio of the project is about 77%, which is a relatively high level of service, that is, the owner's capital expenditure is relatively hot. From here you can see two pieces, one is in our project revenue, the project revenue, the light blue is the part of the project revenue, and then the dark blue part is the balance of the hand order, then the first time we reached a new one up to 149 billion, the first time we will continue to decomend these projects, and then the first time we have the second part of service, and then the second part of the second part of the service, the second part of the second time to see the contract, the contract, the contract, the contract, the second time, the contract, then the second time, the second time, the contract, the contract, the second time, then the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the contract, the second time, the contract, the second time, the contract, the second time, the contract, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time there there there is the second time, the second time, the contract, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time there there there there is the contract, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time, the second time there there there there there is the contract, the second time, the contract, the second time there there there there is a new services, the two, the second time there is a new services, the contract, the two, the two, the contract, the contract, the contract, the two, the two, the contract, the contract, the contract, the contract, the contract, the contract, the two, the two, the contract, then the Therefore, the gross profit of the service category is that we are the manpower generation operation, but the manpower generation operation must have a contractual relationship, it is not long-term, that is, basically it is about two years a contract, two years a contract, so two years a contract, this part will be a little time difference, affect the gross profit rate, but the contract expiration may reflect a little price, because this is the earn money.

The main reason for this is because the price of your project's income, and the price of the project's execution, you can't fully reflect, so at the time of 2022, the raw material price also contains shipping prices, and our prices include the industry price, and the gong war, the whole raw material material on this side of the rise, the natural gas price rise, so the process of natural gas prices has been rising, because the price has already been reported to the owner, so there is no way to reflect the old cost, but you will have to reflect the new cost, I think you have changed your things, you can not sell it cheaper, I have an egg an 8 dollars, how can sell you 6 pieces of tea eggs, this is impossible, but because at the initial price, then reflect the price, then the price, then the price, and the price of the market to us back to the customer's commitment.
