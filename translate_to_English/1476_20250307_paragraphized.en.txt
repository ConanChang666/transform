Welcome to the Investor Conference. I am the presenter. Before the official start of the conference, we are honored to invite Mr. Hu Ruihan, Chairman of Yuanta Investment, to introduce the opening of the conference. Let us share with you with a warm applause. Today, we will introduce to you a lot of investors here, we have a lot of investors, and we have a lot of investors.

We welcome Mr. Hu. Such as the general manager of Rainbow, such as the operation team, the chief financial officer, and all the legal friends and journalists of the meeting, this is an interesting way to retract the opening. However, because the reporter's friends came to me and reminded me of the time when the media was in the media, when our reporters talked to him about running like a rainbow, he said to me that it's bad for the mature industry.

Of course, I think this time, you guys should have a rainbow of clothes. Now it's not just sportswear, my daughter says a dozen pieces, I have four and five, so fashionableFashionable is what you're going to have for dinner with your friends, I'm wearing a rainbow of clothes, functional clothes. So, of course, I'm going to look back and see if this is the second quarter of last year, I found that it's really good. If we look at the time to start in the second quarter of last year, I'm going to see that we've got more than three percent of the gross profit margin, and if we're going to keep it up and down the average gross profit margin is also 31.8. So he has his strength.

Mr. Hu said, "I want to thank you, Mr. Hu, for your support. I would like to thank you, Mr. Hu, for your support. We will take this focus back to today's President, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Lin, the Chief Financial Officer of the Hong Kong People's Republic of China. The agenda will be announced by Mr. Lin, the Chief Financial Officer of the Hong Kong People's Republic of China.

The Q&A session will be co-answered by Mr. Hung and Mr. Lin, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to give my time to the Chief Financial Officer. I would like to thank you all for your interest in investing in advanced media.

The Q&A section of our general manager will answer more questions. Some of the relevant financial-related questions will be answered by me. Today, we will introduce the financial-related questions that will be answered by me. So let's first report to our company because there are some future prospects that may not be published so we will try to answer reasonablely. So if there is something not so clear, then you can ask no more questions. That's basically what we have to say after the briefing, you can write a question ticket or raise your hand to ask questions.

We can see that the total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 is up to 9.5 billion7. That vs. the fourth quarter of 2023 grew by 12.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 by 12.7 billion. That was 28.500 million in gross profit. That grew by 3.4%.

That vs last year was a slight difference in gross margin of 32.51 in the fourth quarter of 2023. So many advanced investors would come to ask me why I am doing this a little bit. There are four main reasons. The first is Protamix Protamix Protamix, which is the product that we can see in the fourth quarter of 2024 the share of the increase of capital is 30% in the 2023 Q4 increase of 40%, so the first is because the share of 2024 is 30% lower compared to the previous year. The second is the delivery of the customer and the delivery of the gross profit product.

還有高毛利產品的交期有部分延至2025年1月所以呢產銷的組合在Q4的產銷組合比例就受了一些影響然後一樣的Q4的銷售也受影響連帶的毛利率也受影響這是第二個原因那第三個原因就是海外的基本薪資持續的提高那我們還有印尼是新的廠人數員工直接人工一直在招募所以越來越增加那目前到12月的時候印尼的整個產線有112條目前是開到99條那但是因為員工都已經招募進來在做訓練所以有在這方面的影響成本那第四個原因是新客人一直是我們努力開發的對象那新客人的一些訂單款式呢有部分特別是更新的客人都仍在熟悉中所以會有部分影響我們的生產效率所以呢在第四季的時候我們看到我們的營業毛利來到29. 85 29. 85可是還是在我們整個經營團隊預計的28-32%這樣的一個區間這些跟大家做個報告接下來我們看一下營業費用那營業費用可以看到2024年第四季的營業費用是918然後vs前一年的同期增加20%那我們也看到營業費用率的確有比2023年第四季高了一些營業費用率來到10. 31那我這邊因為有一些人會Q&A有提問我想說這樣講到就在這邊先回答這邊呢主要是有三個原因營業費用第一個原因是年終獎金的估列我們在Q4的年終獎金跟去年第四前一年的第四季的年終獎金的確有明顯的上升主要的原因是2024年因為我們的營收獲利是主計上升所以獎金的發放金額也隨著主計去調整提高所以我們通常都會在後面的幾季去陸續增提前幾季提列不足的獎金數這是2024年的獎金提列的狀況反觀2023年年底因為營收獲利不如預期所以我們反而在2023年的一樣第四季會去重新看一下我們在2023年第一季去回轉前面幾季所多估列的獎金數所以一個是增加增提一個是減提所以導致這樣子的一個兩期費用的一個比較明顯的差異那第三個原因是當時就是其他的原因對不起第二個原因是出口費用主要是第四季面臨訂單的報單緊急出貨12月底來不及船運出去而延到一月才出貨的金額高達四億元也就是在第四季的時候船艙年底春節前的海運缺艙狀況所以導致整個出口費用明顯上升這是第二個原因第三個原因就是公司的稅有上升有增加薪資也跟著有調薪加班費等等所以讓我們在這一兩期就是1130第四季第12年第四季的營業費用有一些些的上來那我們看一下營業淨利率因為毛利率跟營業費用率所以整個營業淨利率來到19. 54那接下來跟大家說明一下營業外收支營業外收支這邊比較大的數字就是在其他利益及損失這邊主要的數字是來自於匯兌的一個損益我們在2024年的美金升值比較多所以有一個匯兌的收益有到2. 25億那反觀在前一年的是匯損是2. 65億所以來回就會有一個4. 5億的一個差額主要是在這個地方那我們稅前淨利來到21億稅前淨利率是22. 25%然後整個稅前淨利的成長率是22. 2%這是稅前淨利然後到最後的本期淨利是成長21. 95%我們看一下美股營餘美股營餘第四季的美股營餘是6. 22vs前一年同期的5. 10增加了1. 12成長率是21. 96好那看完第四季我們就很快速的來看一下全年度全年度的狀況我們的營收來到368億368億是史上次高僅次於2022年僅次於2022年那成長率vs前一年2023年成長率是19. 61增加了60億增加60億那我們可以看到費用率看到這個營業毛利率也是來到30. 87就回到30%以上回到30%以上那看一下營業費用率好了營業費用率這邊2024年的全年度營業費用率是9. 82vs2023年的同期全年同期10. 16我們就是一個比較正常的狀況也就是說第四季是有一些特殊的一些因為seasonal的級別的一些特殊的費用會坐在第四季所以你如果是整年拉起來做看的話其實那個營業費用率是一定在我們控制的一個範圍內是一定在我們控制的一個範圍內接下來跟大家報告的是整個其他的業外的支出這邊一樣有4. 多億的一個差異主要也是在匯兌的匯兌的收入的差別在今年2024 2024年的匯兌的收益是4. 5億。

That was only $0.500 million in the previous year. So there was an increase in the revenue and expenditure of a 400 million exchange. Let's look at the net profit for this period. Net profit for this period in 2024 was 6.6 billion growth rate of 28. 29%. Net interest rate for this period was 18%.

Last earnings per share 24.2. Compared to last year's earnings 24.2. Growth of $5.33 year-on-year compared to last year's year-on-year 2023. Growth of $5.33 year-on-year. Growth of $5.33 year-on-year. Good.

We can see the revenues of each quarter for the past three years, and we can see the steady growth of the quarters. So if we look at the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, we just mentioned that the increase of 10.7 billion is 12.6 billion. So if we follow the 1 we can see that the figure in Q4 in Q4 is 5. 181 lower than in 2023.

The first one is the low season of Q4. I have just mentioned that the customer's delivery time is relatively tight in Taiwan this year. So the customer's delivery time is until January 2025. One of the four quarters of that time is up to 29. 93. In fact, it is almost 30%.

So, the Q4 sales increase is clearly the highest in history. Second only to Q2 in 2022, the single quarter of 7.1 billion. A single quarter of 2024Q4 to 6.7 billion increase is a year-on-year increase of 31.8%. 31.08 percent. Next, let's take a look at the monthly revenue and let's report our February revenue figure. We can see that February this year's revenue figure is 2.6 billion compared to the previous year, and February 20. 73 has increased by 20. 73.

So let's take a closer look at the steps if the number of February is slightly lower than the previous year. That's a continuation of the previous year or growth from January to February to 18.58 million or continued to grow from the previous year or the previous year is the same as the previous year or the same as the previous month. That's because January to February because the number of days of work is less and there are some Spring Festival holidays in fact, the employees who come back to work, so the start of the labor union is relatively slowly, so a month of shipping in January and February will be slightly moved, so we would suggest that it should be said that while January to February together, it is a step down in February but a step up in February to increase in overall YTD to the current year by 23.97 percent.

The main reason for this is that in the second half of 2024, while waiting for the sale and withdrawal of 1, our annual capital increase ratio was up to 40% and then up to 35%. We looked at the 1 to 2,25 in January and the 1 to 2,2025 in January and the 1 to 28% in February, so we can see that the ratio is up to 28% in January and February. Next, we can report on the profit trend of the 3rd quarter and we can see that our gross profit margin is basically stable growth between 28 to 32%, which means that when we continue to expand the market size, we can also maintain a stable profit and then the net operating rate on the right side, we can see that Q4 number in Q4, the net operating rate is up to 19.54%.

The bottom left is the income after tax, we can see that the number of accumulated income is sustained in the growth and tax after the interest rate continues to grow, of course, mainly is that there are some outstanding income, especially in 2024 exchange benefits, relying on 400 million, and selling some plants to increase profits is 6 million, mainly in 2024 is the two relatively large numbers. The bottom right is the earnings distribution of our distribution of the dividend distribution.

We distribute the earnings per share. The distribution per share is 7 yuan. The distribution rate for that earnings is up to 70%. That is, we want to keep the dividend rate stable.

We can see the two bars on the right. The AR days of 2023 are 50 days. That's from 2024 to 56 days. That's mainly because of the benefits.

In fact, it is all about sales growth. It is especially about earnings. Sales of earnings are the highest in the current year. But we can see the unexpected part. In fact, most of the rising numbers are not expected. So AR is healthy.

Below is a look at the stock. The stock condition is the stock date. Basically, it is below. However, you can see the Q1 order in 2025. Because we expect to rise. In fact, Q4 in 2024 is either the stock of our raw materials or the stock of our products is raised or deferred.

That's because stock increases are controlled for a short period of time. That's why it's the opposite. Well, I quickly made the relevant gross profit margins for you, and the expense ratios for you. Then I'll give the time to the host. Because we're going to do the Q&A next time, thank you again for Lin Fenrong's wonderful presentation.

We arrived at Q&A time. First, we had a question collected before the meeting. We asked the Chief Financial Officer to answer the question. The question will be in paper form. Please send the question to the field staff. We will arrange the order and then ask the general manager to answer the question.

Well, the same is true for me to ask. Before we meet, we know that there are some advanced questions that we want to make more of. I did some sort of sorting. Then I will answer by the general manager. There are some parts that I will add to my answer. The first is about tariffs and Mr. Trump, which are now very popular and everyone cares about us.

The question here, including the change in tariffs after Trump's appointment, will affect the supply chain so that customers will not react to the changes in the supply chain. Well, I do. Well, I do. Well, I do. Well, I do. Well, I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do not. Because the question is very similar to how companies or textile industries deal with tariffs that will share tariffs with customers.

I would like to thank the Vice President of the company, Mr. Frank, for the first time to remember that Mr. Frank, Mr. Frank, I would like to thank the partners of Yuanda. I would like to meet this question because today, I think the situation of Tariff in the company is a simple response to a few questions. That is, the company has a question to say whether there is a change in the situation of customer orders after Trump's position in the supply chain, whether it is a change in the situation of customer orders, such as Rainbow's current situation, because of the current impact of the fact that some of the three major Mexican households in the company's production base is actually affecting some of China's agreements.

Currently, it is possible to stay in the case of a 10-15% add-on order. So, in short, the company's current order is still stuck in the case of a 10-15% add-on order. It is a change that is not visible. It is a change that is not visible at the moment. The fourth question is whether the company's investment in Vietnam is affected by U.S. tariffs or not.

The two points are the current state of the company's overall investment. At present, it looks, and currently looks. In fact, before Tariff's policy, the company's investment in this plan in Vietnam if the problem is Vietnam local will probably stay in some small increase. Some increase in capacity, because the last few spells will probably show that our company's current proportion in Vietnam is relatively high.

This is the current situation. Of course, the target of our review is not of course, there are some other possibilities for Indonesia and Cambodia. That is because we are still in early stage, so if there are some more clear directions, we will do some further explanations with you.

The next question is about the U.S. climate. What is Trump's impact on the U.S. climate after his appointment? What is the outlook for the overall terminal market in 2025. What are the positive and negative factors. On the other hand, there is also a relevant question as to whether Taiwan's current order visibility.

This question was asked by the general manager. Thank you, Vice President. I answered the second question first. That's the visibility of the current order. It's pretty clear that the current customer only to the company forecast seems to be in July.

So looking at the numbers, I can't really tell if he's saying North American needs. Because the numbers seem to fit our expectations at the time. So here are some of the answers to this question. The previous question was about the economic impact of Trump's post-commitment. What is the outlook for the overall terminal market economy in 2025? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

I think it's a good thing to start with. We actually see the world's demand for some sports industry in terms of numbers and client-side meetings. This includes several international events from 2026 to 2028. So overall, this movement is driven by a very strong drive force.

I don't think that this number is going to affect a lot of things in my opinion. That's because it's a consumer market. If there is not enough money in the consumer pocket, then it's going to affect his consumption behavior. So of course, we're still going to review to monitor some of the figures that are actually related to consumer behavior in some countries, including the induction of consumer spending indexes, which we see the biggest uncertainty right now is that the U.S. government has some of the policies in the various industries.

Thank you, General Manager. Next, we have a question about the order. The order has already been seen in July. Please ask if you have a previous order to see if there is any double-digit growth or if you can reach more than 20% growth, especially during the second quarter of 2025 to the third quarter of this year.

In fact, this 20% or double-digit growth goal I would like to say in the previous few spells, probably, that this is a direction and goal that the company's senior management team can hope to achieve. That's what I want to see at the moment.

As for the second half of the year, we just talked about some uncertain factors or needs to be observed, so we continue to monitor. But sometimes looking or saying something old is a prudent and optimistic. Well, next is a question about customers. The first two questions are, because I already have a number, and I report that question first.

Q. What is the share of the five largest customers in 2024? The share of the five biggest customers is still greater than 50% in 2024. The growth rate is 22 digits. The share of the six minorities is currently up to 13% by December 2024. The growth rate is 3 digits. The target of 2025 is 12 to 18%.

So, let's talk a little bit, and then let's go ahead and ask the general manager to answer what the main customer's outlook is for 2025. The order will grow as long as the future growth comes from the addition of the existing customer or new customer. Then, what are the customer's motivations to provide operations in 2025.

All of these are related questions for the general manager to answer. Thank you, Mr. Minister, I've done cover. I'd like to add Q&A if there's something missing. Just to mention the outlook of the main customers in 2025, I'd like to continue our previous law fairs.

So this is no exception. I remember my previous law granting a percentage of the company's adoption of our new product. It looks pretty good right now. That is to say, the client's kinetic energy on the adoption of the new product is also good. So I think it can not be converted to the actual order, I think it depends on the actual market change. That is to say, my adoption rate means that my business will definitely increase.

But my adoption rate is not very clear and clear, it's definitely my TO. So from this point of view, the actual company in the adoption rate of new products in the adoption rate seems to maintain a good condition, so we have a good immediate point. Well, the next point to mention that the main growth of the order is mainly from new customers or old customers.

This is why we can also expect him to work with some of the well-known brands in North America to come in. That in the fabric fabric part of course, we also have some of the development results in the last couple of years. So we included some of the performance or active wear we have in the fabric development in the past, especially for some of the outwear brands that are more professional in terms of price.

I think the development team is also a positive encouragement to say that some of our development levels and even the above levels are constantly rising. This also lets you report ahead. Brand customers and channel customers' orders look forward to the growth of each brand, because the situation of tariff is relatively sensitive to some tariffs or prices above. So the situation of 4Cast seems a little more conservative.

However, overall is about branding and clients, and I think that their outlook for 2025 is positive. Well, there is a question about the current inventory of the industry in 2025. Considering some of the current environment and the existing inventory of the brand and channel customers have not adjusted.

So I think this response should be to say that the stock water they have been down. As for how brands and channel customers adjust their order patterns, I think I should have answered this question a little earlier. Well, above. Well, next is the question about gross profit margin just asking the reason for the company's decline in gross profit margin in the fourth quarter, which I have just helped to answer, so this is no longer answered here.

還有一題是公司2025年的毛利率表現會較2024年加嗎會不會維持在30%以上再跟大家說明就是說其實隨著一些出貨時間點的挪移毛利率每個月或是每季可能會有一些的變化調整,但是我們都會持續在擴大營收的狀況之下持續去維持穩定的毛利率也就是說其實我們認為我們的毛利率維持在28到32區間就是健康穩健的狀態,所以我們對我們的毛利率的態度是審慎樂觀。 這個我不說比較好對,那個補充剛剛副總說的就是毛利率的部分,那的確這公司的內部的一些數字的review我們當然會去看說哪種數字即便它是在這個我們所身邊的範圍那它有任何的上升或下降我們當然都希望可以知道它背後的原因同時再來說是不是在下個月或是來的接下來這些生產的月份能夠針對我們需要可以避免的一些問題我們也希望能夠儘快把它解決。 所以的確我們當時候看到Q4它的Course Margin往下降的時候的確有TRIGGER這個機制,所以我們內部開始做一些review開始做一些檢討那即便它是在28到30的這個我們設定的範圍內但因為它已經往下有下降我們必須要確定說它的Rule Call是什麼以及我們必須要確定說我們經過到2025年的Q1這樣的Momentum是持續往下呢它就是它稍微可以拉回來一些所以我們呼應剛剛副總的提議經過到2025年Q1我們1月份這個狀況看起來因為我們大概已經知道它的Rule Call我們Based on這個Rule Call我們可以看1月份甚至我們肯定2月份大概都稍微再把它拉回來一些。 所以這一點以上補充說明謝謝謝謝總經理的說明補充,那接下來我們就看一下原物料原物料的問題是我們知道目前原物料的價格變化那特別是中國低價傾銷產能過剩的化纖產品是否有助於公司降低材料成分提高貨幣請總經理慢慢回答好謝謝副總以我們現在手上配合的供應商的原物料目前的變化當然這件事簡簡單單是Overall來看看起來算是一個平穩的狀態不過有先進的關係就是中國的一些低價傾銷的一些化纖產品是否會助於公司降低材料成分提高貨幣那我必須要這個地方稍微說明一下我們看到那邊有一個很便宜的東西但不代表說它適合我們用所以我們當然會去monitor會去把他們的原物料會發過來來看一下說合不合適在就是符合是我們的產品那我必須要在這個趁這個機會跟各位說先進說明我們看到台灣的化纖真的很厲害它不是簡單的量就可以說得過去的所以我覺得我們對於台灣的化纖它在很多細節上面很多Performance上面的用心的程度它不是單從它的規格或價格上面可以看得到的所以簡單來說我們當然會評估那公司從來沒有把這個當成是一個這麼有講到說降低材料成本提高獲利的方式我們希望說可以跟整個供應鏈能夠創造一個互惠互利雙贏的一個局面能夠強化公司自己本身的開發一些能力同時能夠跟著我們的供應商一起把一些Innovation適合台灣做的產品把它Secure下來透過這個機會跟各位說明我們當然是一些Commerciate的產品我相信台灣也不是那麼喜歡做一些Commerciate的產品所以這一點大家應該不用太過擔心如果今天真的公司真的需要有這些Commerciate的一些材料我想不只是中國大陸很多地方可能會有像印度都有聽過或沒有聽過的國家可能都會有生產我們當然就是一些採購的機制好以上說明有關資本支出把資本支出產能的擴建擴廠這些放在一起。

The first question is what percentage of the company's current capacity is. This is the first question. Therefore, we come to answer this question. The company's current capacity of the configuration of the countries, the fabric part, we produce about 1000 to 15 million yards. Taiwan and Vietnam, Taiwan 55%, Vietnam 45%, more or less of a range.

The rest is probably part of the Indonesian and Cambodian region. Well, then there is a question about the product. There is a linear question about the condition of the product portfolio in 2025, and I may not know what it means. So we would not have thought about the occupation of 2025, not the profit. If not, we would have to ask again. Is there a possibility for the product portfolio situation now?

The second is the U.S. Republican rule, whether or not the brand will reduce the demand for environmentally friendly clothing products. Therefore, we ask the general manager to answer. Well, I first looked at the product portfolio, I didn't compare the benefits from that, because just everyone explained. But I think there is a big direction in the company, and we will always look at the combination of the product from the perspective of comparison. For example, the proportion of complex products to the proportion of the general kamari, the middle proportion, we have always hoped that we can maintain a certain proportion of the complex product line.

So now we look at our own product line, a positive triangle, and we want to maintain a certain percentage of the high complexity above it. Then I want to enter the next year to 2025 or even 2026, I think this general direction is the same, we will not go completely to pursue the triangle bottom of those composite products. The question is whether the U.S. Republican rule for the industry to launch green carpet, I don't know if you don't see, I don't see, I don't see, I don't see this trend. Because many big brands in the last year or two years, probably have their own initiative, hoping to say that in a certain year physical year, it holds the proportion of green material, the proportion of the product has a certain degree.

So, textiles aren't always complaining about the world's second-largest blue industry. It's like this topic. I think you're a supplier too, and I think it's an important part of our own company. So we don't, even if they don't have that direction, the second is that we have our own direction.

Well, the next question is the AI edge device, which is the rise of AI edge devices, and the company has not developed wisdom 1 has become part of the edge AI. Please sit down, if wisdom 1, maybe two years later that wisdom 1, the answer here will not be me, the company has not developed wisdom 1 plan. I think this question has been asked several times before.

But we are basically in line with their needs to do some research and development. So wisdom 1 has a concrete plane, I clearly report to you, there is no, we are not, but we have a project to follow, but we have a concrete plane's stats, with digital or some digital transformation tools, let us put some of the internal strings into production of the efficiency above. From these two directions, it is true that, from the beginning of what I wanted to start in the past, our ERP system all the way through the chain up to our financial data or sales data, or production of the above data, there is a general framework exists. So how can we use these raw data to connect them first, and the second can have the tools from the background to do this mass data analysis, then this time can be linked to some of some of some of the very popular artificial intelligence tools we just talked about.

好以上。 接下來的幾題可能就由我來回答,因為是比較一些零散的題目,那第一題就是協力廠,目前協力廠的比重就大家報告目前協力廠比重大約是30%,沒有改變,就差不多沒有太大的變化。 然後一個股息發放的疑問,這個疑問非常幽默,所以我想答念一下洪董退休後說要去種田,那公司是否考慮提高股息配發率到八成以上讓洪董以及廣大的股東有資金活水嗎,也可以獲得高股息ETF的清單。 很謝謝這個這位先生,我先幫洪董爭取大幅東,我想我只幫洪董大部分洪董在爭取資金活水,那我這邊代表公司回答一下,本公司目前因為在產業發展還是在屬於成長的階段剛剛有提到我們還要擴廠然後我們還要增加擴充生產錢需要資金,但是我們還是注重股東,所以我們還是會需要錢,但是我們還是會維持穩定的股息發放率,那配息率七成,我想是一個目前的一個基本上的一個輸走。 所以我們2024年明明分配可以配發期礦,那全數以現金股幣發放而且已經有社會主動通過,就先讓大家知道一下,在目前我們還有在擴成的情況之下,我們會去做一個balance就配息率會穩定,但是我們還是需要現金來做擴充的工作,那這邊也跟大家說大家做一下船運的報告,因為去年第四季大家都知道我們的船運狀況有什麼狀況,那這邊做一下報告目前的台灣跟東南亞的船運狀況第四季因為天氣的影響還有春節出貨的旺季影響所以有缺艙這些,但目前已經減緩,那東南亞船運也都較春節前後更為順暢當然有一些港口可能是它自己本身的一些基礎設施不足的因素所以可能有部分有一些港口還是有一些的塞港。 基本上跟第四季相比是減緩,那未來長期可能會影響的也跟大家做一個報告第一個就是紅海危機是否順利的解除,那如果以它達成加薩頓貨協議,那紅海恢復正常的話,這個船運的狀況就更加的減緩,那運費也說不定可以下降,那第二個就是剛剛一直在談的就是中國的貿易的一些變局的影響,那主要就是中國如果出口美國的關稅飆漲,那會導致現在大家還是會在關稅生效前趕快把一些貨物運出去,所以在一月的一個數字發現亞洲、廣美國的運輸量增加了13%,那連續17個月都高於去年的同月,所以一月運輸量是一個歷史的最高的紀錄。

Another piece of information we all know is that U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. USTR has proposed a ship that could be built or operated in China.

It is possible that the shipping company will take some relevant expenses, and it will cost a lot of money. This is a relatively long-term effect. That is, if the Chinese ship can not be transported, that is, to skip the United States, there may be more long-term shipping tensions that may occur. But so far, our main auxiliary shipping to Southeast Asia is better, but it is still to continue to pay attention to the war in the Middle East and the United States trade, above. Thank you for the detailed review of Hong Dong and Lin's Chief Financial Officer, we are now going to visit the site.

I am not sure if this is the case, but I am not sure if this is the case. I am not sure if this is the case. I am not sure if this is the case, but I am not sure if this is the case. I am not sure if this is the case. I am not sure if this is the case, but if this is the case, I am not sure if this is the case, but if this is the case, I am not sure if this is the case, I am not sure if this is the case.

If we can raise our hand right now, can we raise our hand? If we can raise our hand right now, please raise our hand if we need to, we will deliver the microphone to you. If you want to ask, I would like to ask, how can we understand that the sales share of that company was just coming to about 20 % vs 70% in the first quarter of the year?

謝謝。 你剛的意思是說成一跟布布料的比重下降然後成一比重增加是因為內轉的比例增加嗎? 目前看起來的確有這樣的數字,我們內轉的比重有稍微高一些些,但另外一個我覺得比較大的是我們的成一的產能其實有開出來它有一個比較大的產能是說它成一的訂單其實收得還不錯,所以簡單來講其實它訂單增加PO就增加那我覺得主要應該是來這裡但你講的沒錯啦,因為我們自己看另外一個數字內轉的比重在某些開放上面其實看起來也有增加的趨勢,所以以上回答你的問題。 我現在手上有一個問題,今年新增北美知名的成一客戶預計在第幾族的對營收的貢獻比例為多少? 我現在想問一下,因為我現在是在開發,所以它的比例我一直沒有這個數字,但簡單來講它第一季應該不會大,我先這樣講。 任何剛剛那個新增的貢獻比例我現在是在開發,所以它的比例我現在是在開發,所以它的比例我現在是在開發,所以我們所謂的先進同仁在關心的不論是哪一個巨人或者是哪一個新客人我想一開始的時候大概都不太會我們這個大訂單就做起來其實這也不是我們要的我們希望說可以第一件understand客戶端的需求也讓客戶端understand我們的capability那配合過一段時間之後我覺得方向對產品對中端市場的反應對這個demand的projectory就會出來重點還是要賣得出去啦,我覺得啦,所以這個當然就是我們希望可以推一個產品讓品牌端能夠賣得出去,所以這個是我們當然上場方向,所以比例應該第一次的訂單應該不會高,那我們期待啦,對不對我們期待明年吧,或年底。

Thank you so much for your interest in us, we just mentioned our new guests' occupation this year's goal is 12 to 18 and we've come to 13, so it's probably because the new guests will go to 18 to slow down, so it must be like coming in slowly and then repeating it, so we'll be able to feel the changes from the new guests of our little giant. If you still need to use the question form or raise your hand, please let us know.

The second is that I just don't know if the capacity of the fabric is correct. You just said that the capacity of the fabric is 1200 to 15 million kilograms full. Full red dot culture will use kilograms, how do I object, OK, I answered the second question well. This is the average horse weight I think about about 200 to 250, so simple you multiplied by 0.2 to 0.2 25, is the monthly kilogram capacity, so you can answer your question, can not watch, 1200 to 1500, horse then multiplied by the average horse weight, of course this average horse weight will be related to the season, simple say, the average horse will be a little bit lower, the average of autumn and winter will be some higher, so it will be 200 to 300 kilograms per mark, so simply multiply by 0.2 to 0.3, it will likely fall in his month of kilograms, that the good, that the next few, that is not much.

This is the reason why the Prime Minister has changed their orders? No, it is actually one of the reasons why. But I think the proportion should be right, and the proportion should be right, but it is not the main one? This fourth should not be the combination of the structure of the product, which is a larger reason. We have also seen that because the new product is because the proportion of new customers of small orders is actually a bit more in the fourth quarter.

This is one of the reasons why this Prime Minister has mentioned it before, is that small guests are good and bad part of the impact of the fourth quarter, then I am curious to say that this is the reason we have found later this improvement method or because it is because of the nature of the customer relationship, there is no way this can be done. It is later, it is only occasionally will happen, and then, of course, it is not the case, because if we go back to the product we did not do it before, of course, we want to say that the efficiency of the product we did not do it is not so well that we would have a team in the next time we have to do it.

Is there a high single at the moment? Is there a high single at the moment? Is there a high single at the moment? Is the largest guest in the region here? We say that the contribution to our revenue is right or wrong is that the growth of high single at the single beach is not better than his own low single dumb. The problem is that he was a little bit like a little transition last year and he has some new products to quit so we think that this year's growth rate at Crew will be better than last year?

This is because it is in fact after watching them from my point of view that they seem to be holding on to that number last year that we have grown more than I think comes from the kind of chase buy or not in his focus suddenly ask us to make some adjustments above the order, so I really have no way to have enough computer to answer that this year's chase buy situation.
