<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and sort it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim fragments provided by the user in a sentence, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentence.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that sentences are arranged in the correct order of time. Some sentences may have time intervals, but the content is continuous and needs to be merged into the same paragraph. For example, the outlook for 2025 FREETRIP may need to be merged with the previous FREETRIP data.

In addition, the example provided by the user, the transcription of the financial portion is organized into multiple paragraphs, each of which begins around a topic. I need to imitate this structure and classify sentences of the same topic, while maintaining the order and integrity of the original story. During the process, there may be connection problems between some sentences, such as the timestamp is not continuous but content related sentences.

For example, using a connection such as "Next", "In addition", etc. to guide the reader, but the user requests not to add anything, so you can only rely on the connection words in the original. Finally, after finishing the finishing, I read the entire paragraph verb, checking if any of the sentences are missing, and checking if all the sentences are correctly classified, and meeting all the requirements of the user. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to re-arrange the original verb to make sure that there are no errors. </think> Here are the finished paragraph verbatim verbs (re all the original sentences, only re-arranged according to semantic logic): The copper process dropped 0.2% in 2024 compared to 2023, while the golden thread process also decreased by 0.4% and the freetrip rose 0.6%.

In the second half of 2024, we look at the classification of this middle market, which is about 55. 6%, Computer 7. 2%, Communication 8. 6%, Automotive 3. 6%, AI 1. 6%, Industry 3. 4%. Among them, there is only Consumer, Computer, and Industry, and AI revenue above is growth. There is a slight decline in communication-related revenue, and only the second half of the second half of the year is mainly due to the rapid decline in the international automobile market, which is mainly due to the decline in automotive electronics demand.

The second is the slow growth of industrial and consumer electronics. The third is the increase in demand for new PC and notebook products, and the rise in demand for high-end esports, so the capacity of production is also slightly increased. DDR5's module market has increased P-MIC-related ICs gradually.

The second AI mid-end device has the opportunity to promote the development of the switch slot, the strong development of Virtual 3 new products, the current output of new customers and the newly added operation number. The analog chip has emerged a climatic bottom-line signal, and is in the process of resuming the recovery. The utility of the transmutation of the U.S.-China technology station should be noted for significant revenue this year. The second U.S.-China trade war continues to be fermented, and Taiwan IC design company is subject to the Chinese policy requirements for the rise in autonomy, increasing the proportion of China's closed-loop testing.

In the face of the competition pressure in Taiwan to continuously optimize the competitiveness of the product and cost market, we will continue to invest in AI and automation and reduce manufacturing costs to enhance our competitiveness. Last but not least, Q1's customer orders are very conservative, but we can expect that Q1 will increase our capacity utilization slightly compared to the same year. Thank you, General Manager. Next, we would like to set up the Chief Financial Officer to explain the financial situation to you.

Since it was supposed to be the next week of every month of the month for us to hold a spell party because next week is a Chinese New Year holiday, we are going to report to you a week in advance about our current operation. First of all, I would like to greet you in the early morning and wish you all a healthy new year, and the success of your investment mission.

First of all, you can see the QOQ comparison in the fourth quarter of QOQ, you can see the fourth quarter of revenue to 170.97 billion, compared with the third quarter of this year, the QOQ part of the roughly reduced 6.6 percentage points. Here the reduction part is mainly the most familiar with the industry-based customers to place orders to keep, so in the PTI this D-RAN and the NAND part of the reduction of about 6 to 16 percentage points, respectively, resulting in a decrease in revenue. The gross profit margin part is reduced from the third quarter from 21.4 to 18.3, the main reason I want to reduce the amount of revenue in addition to a little decrease, and we have three days of overtime fees due to typhoon in October last year, and because of the electricity prices in October, because we know that the increase in the majority of revenue of the majority of revenue.

The EPS part reached to 2.04, compared to the 2.28 of the 3rd quarter, about a quarter of the situation was reduced. Well, then, we will report the comparison with the YY of the 4th quarter. From this report, you can see that the Q4 of the Q4 of the 23rd quarter is about 17.0.97 billion and Q4 of the 23rd year, and the YY part is about 10% less, about 10% less.

That part of the gross profit margin is because of the relatively low revenue scale, the relative overtime spending and the increase in electricity bills, which also resulted in a quarterly gross profit margin of about 2.2 percentage points lower than the same period last year. In fact, in the external part of the industry, the fourth quarter of last year, we disposed of 70% of the shares in Suzhou last year, including our shareholding in Suzhou, about 3.5 billion losses, and some of the losses in exchange, so the industry here, from last year's 2.8 billion profits, to the third quarter of the year, the net income 43 billion, in fact, includes the benefits of 3.5 billion, so if this part of the profit reduction last year, it is likely that the fourth quarter of the net income is about 8 billion, it is a considerable growth.

That part of the gross profit margin has also been continuously optimized from last year's 17.9 percent to 19.1%. The whole fee section has increased from 44.54.4 billion to 46.3 billion a slight increase of 4 percentage points, so the net profit portion has increased from 81 billion last year to 93 billion I think this is a profit performance in the industry, even if in 2023 we have a full year of revenue in Xi'an and nine months of revenue in Suzhou, in 24 years, the whole net profit margin has been able to continue to grow by 1.2 percentage points.

First of all, in the 2023 report, we cover the whole year of Xi'an revenue and 9 months of output of a 9-month transmission week, that number if we peel this part, from last year's 70 billion parts will become about $6.3 billion. That 2024 billion in the 2024 included nearly $33.3 billion of Xi'an revenue, so if we remove this part of the revenue, you can see that the revenue part of the Xi'an revenue increased from $6.3 billion to 699 billion, the growth of YY reached about 11%, about 11%. I would like to see more clearly on the basis of consistency, PTI in terms of revenue, although we expect our total revenue to continue to grow under a reduction of Xi'an's revenue, that continues to grow in addition to grow.

In addition to one part of the changes in memory, there is a logical development of the company in recent years, I think we continue to do a lot of work in that part of the gross profit margin can be seen, when the cost base price in Xi'an is the part of Cost Plus, so his average gross profit margin is lower than the company's Coverage Average part, so when the low gross profit margin of this part is removed, adding some relatively new products such as AI, our profit margin is slightly increased from 2023 18.9 to 19.5. The YY part of the gross profit margin also adds about 0, 6 percentage points. The last part of the EPS you can see about the part of the EPS, if we take it out of the transaction in Suzhou, the corresponding profit contribution 2023 is 6.46, compared to this year's profit contribution to the year's half of the profit contribution, the year, the EPS is roughly 8.62. 62. 62, the YY is close to the three parts of the year is close to the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the share of the shares of the share of the same with the year.

Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer, we have invited the Chief Executive Officer of Licheng Group to explain our business and industry situation. We have already reported that we have done some major projects here. The first quarter of our 2024 revenue is 17. 1 billion, QoQ just said we are 6. 6% Drop, mainly because we have to predict that some products will be mass production, but this is because the product itself is not enough, and there is also the so-called machine learning chip between his Qualified Cash is not as expected, so we did not have a slight decrease in our revenue, Gross Margin is 18. 3%, and we have lost 3. 1 percentage point, EPS 2. 04 compared to 2.28.5%, because we still have a lot of our sales in 2013.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained.

First of all, I check each timestamped the corresponding sentence in a sentence to see if there is a natural paragraph separator. For example, a segmentation may be required when the speaker mentions different product categories or market segments. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sentence is arranged in chronological order without confusion. Next, I identify duplicated or similar content, such as discussions about parts like DRAM, NAND Flash, Module, etc., that may require combining sentences of the same topic into paragraphs.

In addition, parts such as “Consulting Remedy by Product” and “revenue by end market” mentioned by the user may require separate segments, as they involve different analytical dimensions. At the same time, content such as AI needs, stock adjustments, market expectations, etc. also requires reasonable segmentation to ensure logical clarity. During the processing process, I need to ensure that sentences within each paragraph are arranged in chronological order without missing any timestamps or content.

The following is the collated paragraph verbatim script (totally retaining all original content, undeleted/rewritten/condensed): This part of our 2024 statement is also a part of our service pattern to divide the test by 22%. The module part is 10%. Last year 2024 is now 2025.

There is a lot of demand for short orders and collection orders. That's why. He uses it for AI servers. So we have that part of our business. Significant growth. Up to 10%.

The package portion is 68%. Compared to last year, 2023 is a year earlier. But 69% hasn't changed much at all. That's our 4G. Consulting Remedy by Product.

The DRAM is 19% in 4G. The NAND Flash part is 28%. The SHIP and Module part is 11%. The logic part is 42%.

Because of the 4G we are actually. We are facing. NAND Flash. Their entire module part is 18%. So we're down in this stock.

There is no such thing as expected, so the NAND part is slightly lowered slightly. So from. 31% of the 3G dropped. 28% of the 4G.

That's what it's all about. Big inventory adjustments. Because it's really AI needs. But it's in the mobile part of the phone. Some of the mobile part of the NAND phone needs.

This page is about 2024. Put our product category. DRAM is 22%. That NAND is 28%.

That's 10% of the module. The logic part is 40%. So you can still see our logic part from 2024. It's still growing.

NAND is actually there. It is still lower than the previous year, but we expect it to be in the future. There may be AIPCs. We may also have applications for our AI.

The demand for NAND is expected to be expected next year. 2G. Or even the slowest word in the second half of the year. Its demand for NAND should grow significantly. This part is waiting for us.

In our outlook section. We will probably say. That part is our 4G. Our return by end market is the final market look. Our car is 14%.

Communication is 24%. The communication part is slightly missing because of the mobile networking and wireless AR VR here. It is our communication. It is missing because it is actually mobile here. The computing part is 25%.

We have a significant growth in the 3G. The consumer part. We are 27% also growing. The industry part.

The 3G is the same as the 4G. That's the AI part. Yes. It's the same as 8%. It's the 4G part.

We follow. That's the part. For the city, we can see that automotive is 14%. In fact, the automotive part. In fact, it is slowly falling. I think.

Everyone has an investment in management. Everyone in the media is very clear. That is to say, the auto part of the story is because of the fact that EV Car is questionable.

The whole area has some economics. In fact, it is not very good. The market is also saturated, so the parts of the car has a lot of changes, especially in.

In the mainland China market. They basically want to make their own. So there will be some impact on what our customers have to say.

From 1G to 4G, 24% of us have come. 30% of the 3G will eventually fall to 24%. Consumers will probably grow a little. This part of the computing section we have. From 1G to 4G, there is actually a decrease. The industry section is more frequent.

The AI part is almost 4% from the 1G. Since our second quarter of the year we have been counting. That time, 6% grew to 8% today. I think. In AI we are still growing.

Because of our recent investment, there are a lot of investments for AI investing. We hope to make a comparison in 2025. At least in the 2G 3G should bring a comparison.

All in all. 4Q24's business looks like we're making a summary. Standard group. Memory. Second half of the demand is conservative.

However, if we don't contain rare aggregates. In the first half of the year, we rarely contribute more than one month to more than six billion. If we remove rares, we keep the two of us.

Double digits. The growth of that mobile memory. The memory of that mobile memory increases year-on-year. It is consistent with our expectations. But because.

Mobile is actually here. It is a relatively mature market. You have to see him grow very much. Now it is a bit more difficult.

Unless, later called AI. AI. That mobile phone. I think this part. Or bring it.

So we're still seeing the same long term. Ours. Mobile memory will still have significant growth here. Especially in the second half of next year. I think we can see.

[2472. 64-2475. 20] The annual revenue growth memory receipt is flat. [2476. 22-2480. 58] The part of this part just said that the car part is really under the challenge situation. [2480. 82-2482. 36] is under the challenge situation. [2482. 62-2483. 64] In the case of [2484. 66-2486. 98] In the case of Nano, our SSD shipments are reduced.

[2491. 06-2493. 62] The word of the year is still a slight growth. [2494. 66-2498. 74] SSD actually speaks of the so-called AI generation in fact many people speak of the fact that it does not appear to be mounted on this windmill. [2501. 06-2502. 34] It does not appear to be mounted on this windmill. [2502. 64-2503. 40] The windmill. [2503. 66-2504. 42] In fact. [2504. 68-2505. 20] In our history, we feel it.

[2505. 46-2508. 26] In our journey, we feel that SSD will eventually have its performance because of the speed of AI. [2512. 36-2513. 38] is the speed of the application. [2513. 64-2514. 16] It also has its performance. [2514. 66-2515. 70] SSD has a very significant performance growth compared to Hard. [2520. 30-2523. 62] It has a very significant performance growth. [2523. 88-2524. 66] All of the density of the SSD is said to be more and more.

[2530. 28-2530. 80] More and more. [2531. 06-2531. 82] Especially when many PCs may or may have used Hard disk drive and other years will slowly be replaced by SSD. [2536. 18-2538. 22] And other years will slowly be replaced by SSD. [2538. 74-2539. 50] So in Long term, Nano expects to be in the second half of next year. [2542. 06-2542. 58] When AI PCs come out of AI mobile phones, we are talking about Edge computing after Cloud computing.

[2551. 02-2552. 56] Now we are talking about the future of Cloud computing Edge computing. [2552. 82-2555. 62] There will definitely be more demand for SSDs. [2557. 94-2558. 96] There will be more demand for SSDs. [2559. 46-2560. 74] If the SSD needs to have NAND, there will be an increase of NAND. [2561. 82-2562. 34] This part of this part I think should be the whole trend.

[2569. 50-2571. 80] Customers' demand slowed down to a quarterly decline. [2572. 06-2573. 34] Increase in numbers year-on-year. [2573. 60-2576. 42] This is what has happened in our fourth quarter. [2580. 00-2581. 54] The revenue of the logical part of the story is consistent with the quarterly revenue. [2584. 86-2586. 40] Increase in number year-on-year. [2586. 66-2598. 98] That is because just before our quarter overall, the customer continued to go out.

[2590. 24-2590. 74] Customers continue to go out. [2591. 00-2591. 78] Revenue growth in double digits 12%. [2591. 42-2598. 22] This is especially due to the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2024 some customers want to build inventory, especially under the potential tariff impact. [2605. 14-2607. 70] They want to create inventory, especially under the potential tariff impact. [2607. 94-2608. 98] Under the potential tariff impact, they want to be able to create inventory in their clients. [2609. 22-2611. 54]

[2612. 04-2614. 86] The fourth quarter of the super peak's revenue is completely unexpected. [2620. 94-2623. 04] brings great contributions. [2623. 30-2626. 62] So they bring 12% growth throughout the year. [2627. 14-2630. 98] Telapro and Telapower are not the same as our Japanese company. [2632. 00-2632. 78] The customer. [2632. 02-2635. 84] The automotive customer needs slowed down that previously reported with investment friends.

[2636. 36-2637. 90] Says that because our Telapro Telapower is a qualified supplier of Grade Zero, he is a supplier of the highest level of automotive. [2646. 08-2647. 62] The automotive supplier. [2648. 14-2649. 66] He also supports us with a large number of customers in Japan and we have several large customers in Japan and in Europe. [2656. 32-2665. 36] It is the customer of the automobile. [2659. 64-2665. 54] But in the second half of 2024, we can see that the car is slowly easing, especially in the EV Car. [2668. 34-2668. 86]

[2669. 12-2669. 88] Yes. [2670. 66-2669. 18] Greater demand is very obvious. [2672. 44-2674. 50] Inventory is also very high. [2674. 74-2679. 10] So their end customers there continue to adjust and control the inventory. [2681. 70-2683. 76] The manufacturer's words to the automobile manufacturing begin to control the inventory even more. [2688. 62-2689. 90] The inventory is even more controllable.

[2690. 42-2690. 92] So the demand for our Telapro Telapower part fell slowly, but this is not forever. [2698. 34-2701. 94] It was more obvious in the second half of 2024. [2702. 18-2706. 02] The HPC and AI demand continued to grow steadily. [2706. 28-2708. 08] So our Telapro is so much smaller that he has a very small number of slowdowns than our entire silver revenue. [2711. 96-2715. 80] But Telapower is still growing. [2721. 18-2724. 00] We now look at our entire EQ 2025 and the next Outlook business for everyone.

[2729. 88-2731. 16] Report to everyone. [2731. 42-2734. 50] The entire industry as a whole, the global economy is eager to continue a mild growth trend. [2734. 74-2735. 52] Continues a mild growth trend. [2735. 78-2737. 30] AI applications continue to drive the technology industry. [2738. 08-2739. 62] Technology development. [2739. 92-2740.4. 94] This is something we all know.

[2742. 22-2743. 76] This is all we all know. [2744. 78-2748. 10] The new U.S. government takes over the measures of technological trade competition and the development of tariffism. [2748. 36-27449. 64] And the development of tariffism. [2750. 16-27454. 76] This is what we have to pay more attention to in fact, Trump took over last night. [2755. 02-2755.7. 78] Has already taken over. [2756. 04-2757. 32] He has a lot of executive orders.

[2759. 38-2760. 66] That's certainly the impact that many of us have been asking what countermeasures we have against the so-called new protectionism. [2767. 56-2768. 08] We have countermeasures. [2768. 34-2768. 84] The so-called new protectionism. [2769. 10-2771. 40] We have countermeasures. [2771. 66-2771. 16] In fact, I feel that I set up a group to go with the plan head or guess. [2778. 32-2779. 34]

This is our strategy. [2789. 32-2789. 84] That is to say that we have set up a continuous effort on Advanced PackageAdvanced Technology. [2793. 92-2794. 96] Working hard. [2795. 20-2795. 72] Our Terra PowerTerra Pro we continue to build on the so-called future AI test platform. [2802. 62-2806. 22] This year we actually tested on AI we may even have about 344 billion investments.

[2812. 62-2813. 90] Does not include last year's investment has not yet been delivered. [2817. 98-2819. 02] There is no delivery. [2819. 26-2820. 30] This part I think we can still support. [2823. 36-2824. 38] We can still support it. [2824. 90-2825. 42] It is because they are more free chip products compared to Legacy's Liframe Base. [2831. 30-2832. 58] Compare Free chips.

[2833. 34-2835. 40] The impact of that part is relatively small. [2835. 66-2836. 68] In fact, the comparison should benefit the entire trade competition. [2840. 00-2840. 78] Because a lot of comparisons compared low-level Liframe Base products before many of our great competitors were from China. [2851. 78-2854. 08] When the whole time it was Blocked, it was actually a benefit to the overwind. [2854. 34-2855. 62] We also saw that Q1 just spoke to our reporter Q1, which basically looks like the Q1 of 2023.



We should be able to get it soon, but we should be able to get it soon, but there are still some. That is, of course, the fact that this product development is definitely what we expected from our customers. Our Panel Level is also the same, we have several customers in the Panel Level, which may take a while. For our HBM section, the HBM section of our development is called HBM2, HBM2E, and HBM3 Sun One. For this part, we are actually Ready for HBM2E and HBM2E, but we are still developing HBM3, and we will have the opportunity to report with you.

This part of our equipment is equipped with a capacity, of course, we have the most advanced investment in our equipment is our own U.S. machine, then the fact that these two parts we started to invest in in the second half of 2024, then we may have a large investment in 2025, because the investment there is a very high. That is because there is a need for us to invest, so we have a large customer with our customers, but we don't talk about the name of the customer, in fact, the U.S. is a very large customer. The first quarter of the effect memory and logical memory is flat, so we also hope that the second half of the slowest word can see the growth of his order at the second half.

In that case, we hope that our over-the-air FreeShip products can have a capacity of at least 100 million per month, which we can do. The customer ordered Q1 and kept, but this is because it just said that I am because of our China plus one our China corner, so Q1 will basically be better than Q1 last year.

The AI application is to suppress the uniqueness of our products, including our packaging. It may feel like you've been talking to our chairman for a long time, in fact, a lot of the time, I've been talking to the chairman of the board, so sometimes these products are a bit of a miss window, because the cost, product development time is really beyond everyone's imagination, because the product is really very complex. But in fact, we've been talking about the HBM part, we've had a customer development with Japan, then they've just temporarily changed from HBM2 21 to HBM3, so their products aren't ready, but our technology we're continuing.

All investors, I would like to share with you the last part of PTI's ESG efforts this year. From the left side of the screen, PTI continues to participate in this award from Taiwan Sustainable Energy Foundation. For nine consecutive years, we have received an award of 100 gold in the sustainability report issued by the Taiwan Sustainability Association, and also included in a list of 100 corporate models.

At the same time, in the association's global sustainable corporate model, we have won the Bronze Award. The parts of these cases mentioned in the report are also a real situation in our internal work, and are also included in a share of the best case that can be provided to the relevant peers or friends as a reference. I think this is in the award section.

In addition to the capital market, we also have some index companies in Taiwan and internationally renowned Fuji companies, which are listed as so-called constituents in the development of Taiwan's ESG constituents and emerging market ESG constituents. I think that a winning part here also affirms PTI's role in ESG as well as the ongoing investment efforts. At the same time, we basically do what we do within the company, in addition to the corresponding board of directors, through a corresponding approach to accounting, to strengthen this role.

***3692. 20-3695. 40** is capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of Earth citizens. **3695. 40-3697. 40** I would like to represent this one. **3697. 40-3699. 90** We have a continuous effort in ESG. **3699. 90-3702. ** In this respect, we will continue to work with the company and the industry. **3702. 90-3706.

**3706. 10-3708. 20** Deepen the relevant one. **3708. 20-3710. 50** Above report. **3710. 50-3711. 80** Thank you. **3711. 80-3714. 50** Above description of the technical and ultra-thin electronics. **3714. 50-3716. 80** Management Team. **3716. 80-3718. 70** As the coming year will be next week.

**3718. 70-3720. 80** Prior to Q&A. **3720. 80-3724. 06** We ask the Chairman to greet you early in the year. **3724. 06-3725. 24** and illustrate the success and success of the company. **3725. 24-3725. 26** and illustrate the success and success of this year's company. **3725. 26-3725. 36** and illustrate the success and results of this year's company. **3725. 36-3725. 44** and illustrate the results of this year's company.

**3725. 44-3725. 46** and illustrate the company's results this year. **3725. 46-3725. 48** and explain the company's results this year. **3725. 48-3726. 32** encourages policies. **3726. 32-3732. 74** and recent legal entities are continuing to focus on technological developments. **3732. 74-3736. 82** such as HBM, flight PLP, Coworks, etc. **3736. 82-3740. 92** and the latest developments in product development for customers.

**3740. 92-3741. 98** Welcome to the Chairman. **3745. 30-3746. 64** Hello everyone. **3746. 64-3750. 70** First to report to you. **3750. 70-3755. 22** Congratulations to all of you for your early years. **3755. 22-3760. 28** Happy New Year.

**3760. 28-3761. 50** I would like to ask the first question. **3761. 50-3765. 90** Questions about encouragement policy are issued by EPS. **3765. 90-3771. 72** The encouragement policy of our past journey is EPS. **377. 72-3777. 46** No less than 60% of EPS policy is issued by EPS. **3777. 46-3780. 08** This was last year in 2024. **3780. 08-3782. 18** We sent 7 pieces of money.

**3782. 18-3784. 26** We EPS. **3784. 26-3785. 08** is 10. 72. **3785. 08-3787. 44** We approximate distribution rate is 65%. **3787. 44-3793. 76** was released last year 2024. **3793. 76-3798. 36** Our EPS9. 09. **3798. 36-3801. 96** compared to last year.

**3801. 96-3805. 28** is slightly lower than the previous year's 2023. **3805. 28-3807. 60**, but less than a single drop of ours. **3807 60-3810. 84** We have done better than last year. **3810. 84-3813. 16** is better than the previous year. **3813. 16-3815. 04**, so take into account our investment public. **3815. 08-3807. 12** has all of our finances.

**3818. 12-3821. 12** We think we are still able. **3821. 12-38232. 36** We have a better distribution rate for EPS. **3823. 32-3828.2. 32** We will be like February. **3828. 32-3829.1 76** We will be like February. **3829. 76-3833. 64** We are like the Board of Directors in May. **3833. 64-3836. 08**

**3836. 08-3838. 28** We want to distribute 7 pieces of money as ours. **3838. 28-3844. 92** We will. **3843. 20-3844. 44** I think this is the first question we would recommend to the board of shareholders. **3847. 44-38556. 44** I think the second question is the research direction of our new product technology. **3846. 44-3863. 44** The first one we are talking about is our TSV technology to make a CIS image sensor.

The second problem lies in the research direction of our new product technology. **3874. 08-3874. 48** The second problem lies in the research direction of our new product technology. **3874. 48-3875. 08** I think we are the few in the industry to be able to use TSV technology to do the image sensor of CIS. **388. 58** It is mainly used in monitoring and automotive. **388. 58-3891. 84** Then we have verified that we use TSV to do this with the CIS image sensor. **389. 84-3901. 08** It is performance.

**3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance. **3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance. **3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance. **3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance. **3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance. **3903. 68-3903. 68** It is performance.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user requests, sorting the provided verbatim fragments into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I need to read the rules and examples provided by the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity and order of the original text.

First of all, I will check the provided verbatim fragment to see if there is a timestamp or other markup that needs to be processed. In the example given by the user, each sentence has a timestamp, but the finishing paragraph verbatim text needs to be removed from these timestamps and only the conversation content is preserved. Therefore, I need to extract the corresponding content of each timestamp first, and then sort it into paragraphs in order. Next, I need to determine how to segment.

For example, when a person begins to answer a question, it may need to be a separate paragraph, or when a topic is converted, it may need to be a paragraph. During the process, I need to make sure that no sentence is missing and that the original order is kept. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency between sentences, making the paragraph read more natural. For example, if a person says several sentences in a row, it may need to be merged into a paragraph, while the conversation between different people needs to be separated.

In addition, some sentences are separated by timestamps, such as [4214. 60-4216. 60] and [4216. 60-4222. 60], which may mean that the same person is speaking continuously, so they should be merged into the same paragraph. If there is a larger interval between the timestamps, it may mean that different people are speaking, and segmentation is required. During the processing process, it is also important to pay attention to the use of punctuation marks to ensure that each sentence ends with the correct punctuation, such as periods, question marks, or exclamation marks.

So we will walk a little bit harder, but we will use system provider as our target customer, so I think we will compare the long term. So this is one thing about the chip on wafer, and then our chip on panel is great, because now I want everyone to know that the SOC is getting bigger and bigger, the die size, and the other components.

When we were with a lot of people, his die size was actually a wafer not a lot, so our panel became a big advantage. Now many customers asked us to do the chip on panel, but the only problem we think is that we all would have to deal with the other problem is that we designed this chip on panel, we wanted the so-called middle end to be made of some wafers, we wanted to do it on panel, but when we wanted it to be subpanel, we wanted it to cut it into subpanel. But now we want our customers to say that we can do more than that, it is a panel that can be put in, but that is what we want to do, and it is not easy to find a machine to hit that big panel. I think that in this area, our panel size, in fact, in other applications is very successful, I think, we are involved in the so-called very hot talk about AR, talk about AI, and some wearable things, we are involved in some of the manufacturing of the wearable, in fact, we are not able to participate in some of these things, so we just want to invest with you advanced, that is, we do not say, mean we do not do, or we can not do, in fact, we are ready, I am here to tell you, I want to be different from last year, the first quarter of the year, the biggest thing, last year is good, the third quarter because of the customer inventory adjustment, so we gradually did not have no hands, we will be on the fourth quarter, we will be on the opposite, we will be doing this, we will start because of the customer inventory adjustment, with a slow down, so may be a little, but we will gradually, but we will gradually, we will be getting better, with the development of new technology development, this year we should be optimistic about our future future development, thank the chairman, thank the chairman, next time, next time, thank the Q&A.

In this part of the question, I would like to answer by myself, the super wind is in the third generation of semiconductor, in fact, we are talking about the price of nitride and silica, because the price of nitride part, because its production does not require new equipment, so this part is in the super wind part, we are actually in the production of 2024, there are a number of customers in the super wind part of the operation, that part is in the 2024, we are probably in the revenue of more than two million, which accounts for the total of last year's revenue about 1.5%, and of course, there are other manufacturers at home and abroad, is also in the phase of engineering verification, this part of nitride price, but because the customers are in the IDM factory, and because the main nitride price of silicon, so this part of the process is different, because the process is different, we need to invest in this part of some investment equipment, we have to invest in this part of this part of this part of this part of the we have been to invest in this part of this part of this part of the most we have been to invest in the most we have to invest in this part of this part of the latest, we have to invest in the next next next time, we have to invest in the product, we have to invest in the next week to invest in the next time, we will be to invest in the next time, we will be to invest in the most of the next next next time, we will be a series, we will be in the product, because we will be in the next next next time, we will be a series, we will be in the product, we will be in the next next year, we will be in the next time, we will be in the next time, we will be in the tt we will be in the product, because we will be in the t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t , we we we we we we we we will be the t t t t , we, we will the t , we will be in the product, we will be the , we will be in the product, mainly we will be in the

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-abridged transcript: These packages. That's what I mentioned in my previous report, as far as we look forward to 2025. This is mainly because Trump may have different rates for the entire of our partners. So in China, what we're hearing today may be higher than the rest of the world. In this part, I think a lot of brands will actively seek base production outside China to reduce their impact.

So because China plus one is a need for Taiwan manufacturers, and even we are super wind, I believe we can gather some of China's automotive China's turnover benefits. The related automotive electronics, in fact, in the mainland China, are relatively developed early, but also used a lot of places. So I think the Chinese autos are going to come out, in fact, we have some Engage, so we still have the opportunity, because he is out of the situation, they are going to the international market. So I believe that this, we have a little opportunity.

In addition, because the whole AI server, like some products of the super wind, the AI PC exchange slot, I believe that this is a positive direction for the super wind, because we are also doing this, that is, it is only at the moment, because the effect of Trump, in fact, will change in the future, and sometimes we are hard to determine. So if we exclude this part, in fact, we should, in 2025, our entire operation, I believe that we still have the opportunity to grow. I think this is a report with advanced media friends today, thank you.

What is the outlook for 2025? What is the product demand delayed in the fourth quarter of 2024? Then what is the change in capital expenditure in 2025? I would like to answer this part of the outlook for 2025. Waiting for our capital expenditure section to be answered by our general manager.

But DRAM has a major client, and it has the capacity to demand a large car in Q2. Of course, we can support it, and we expect different packages in the second half of the year. This part is because it involves the confidentiality of some of our customers and we can't follow Liquid. In fact, its own DRAM may not be a traditional package, but its Bandwidth may be wider due to different packages.

What we have to say about NAND is that it is relatively slow compared to Slow, and we expect that it will slow down in Q2. In the future, the Edge Computing is better, or Cloud Computing is better, and the long-term demand for the whole NAND is still positive. As we have just said before in the advanced process, it is that we are in HBM, our development is actually the part of 2 and 2E, and we are ready. Of course, with customers because this is the so-called few of our customers in the United States, Korean suppliers are also, they are all using Latice version HBM, which is called 3E. Even next year to 4E. But it is a lot of demand in 2 and 2E.

But this supplier turned it into a smaller Maker for smaller DRAMs. In this part of the story, sometimes our Ready customers don't have to be ready. In the whole part, I think that HBM's story is not a problem in the course of the journey. The opportunity to work with us is what we play as an EU company or a Korean company.

This part has to be rely on OZ. So it takes time. I often say not to say that we should be ready to be prepared for the perfect people. So I think our journey is logically just to say that automotive products in Q1 is not a good future, and I think we still have a lot of opportunities. So the whole EQ revenue, I think that the market EQ, we are the whole summer is Q1, we will be less slowly hope for better opportunities.

This part of our operation is our 2025 outlook. At that time, our CAPEX section, I found our general manager JS to answer. Thank you. Regarding this year's CAPEX, like last year we had an estimate of 1.5 billion, that actually occurred 1.3 billion. That year we still expect to maintain a level like last year's.

Thank you for sharing your experience with the management team. The above seminar will be completed today. Investors can view the presentation and video replays of today's meeting. Thank you for your participation.

I wish you all good health, investment health, and investment smooth.
