Today's meeting leaders will first have our Vice President Yang Kairong, Manager Zhang Weijun, and Manager Tsai Jiaming. That today's book will become two stages of the company's presentation and Q&A. Those investors can be below us, a point point point in the point, there is a sido option, then in the Q&A field, the company will be able to enter your questions, and the company will be processed and agreed to reply in Q&A time.

Well, now that you're investing in advanced and media friends, today, uh, yes, I'm going to report to you about the company's first quarter of the year 2025, the content of that meeting is divided into four parts, which is mainly for the company's profile, reputation and performance, and the results of ESG 2025, ah, and finally Q&A. Ah, first of all, let's look at the company's profile, the company was founded in May 25, 1999, then we listed on December 9, 2019, with a share capital of NT$7.2 billion, the general manager Mr. Liu Yuanshengsheng was Mr. Lin, and the number of employees integrated investment reached 2,14 people.

We have invested a total of three companies in Taiwan. The first one is a joint venture company, which owns 80 percent of the joint venture, which owns 19 percent of the joint venture. The other one is a joint venture, which owns 80 percent of the joint venture, which owns 18 percent of the joint venture, and which owns two percentages. The other is a joint venture, which owns 100% of the joint venture.

The second is the joint venture, which mainly engages in commercial and large-scale car divergences and for commercial and large-scale bus companies to do some business financing. The third joint venture, we are divided into three major businesses, the first is energy, the second is energy, the second is energy, the second is energy, the third is energy, mainly from Thailand, and then from FC, that energy is charging piles. The fourth is joint venture, the joint venture is focused on the operation of corporate finance, mainly small and medium enterprises.

In terms of funding capacity, we are strong, and at the same time, we can continue to support the growth of our business. We are in the total trust section, we have 42.51 billion yuan, then we use the amount to reach 27 billion yuan, the total turnover to 64%, indicating that we still have enough funds to continue to expand the new business. Good that continued is the part of the operation performance, the summary of the Q1 operating results in 2025, our consolidated revenue of 60.86 billion yuan, and the previous year down about 22 percentage points.

We were in August last year, because of the heavy industry of the group, we sold the shares of the Hyun operation. That Hyun operation, especially in the first quarter of last year, its revenue is about 1.2 billion yuan. So if we use this Apple to Apple comparison method, although the revenue time in the first quarter then fell by 22%, if we cut this last year about 1.2 billion yuan, in fact, the increase in revenue is about 85%, that is the corresponding part of Taiwan, will also be affected.

Because of Taiwan's part. Last year, $66 billion. In fact, it took 1.2 billion. Co-Cloud operation. It has been sold.

In fact, last year's revenue from Taiwan was roughly the same, about 85% of the continent.

Here we are going to talk about it. OK Next is 2025. Q1's earnings yield bond. Net profit after tax consolidation came. $7.72 billion.

That EPS came. $.47. It was mainly held in March of this year. It was released to $4.5 billion. That Jomo affected EPS about 0.7. It was a little too five-year-old here.

In fact, in the first quarter of this year, the net profit after the combined tax. In fact, the decline.

This EPS is not proportional, because it is. EPS is this year. It is our first quarter of the year. This special dividend is recognized. 23.350 million.

I'm sorry. 43.5 billion. I'm sorry. 43.5 billion. In fact, the same period last year was probably a special dividend.

4.3.5 billion. The same period last year was around 2.87 billion. So if this particular dividend factor is taken into account, it should be the same. Net profit after the combined tax is equivalent.

In 2025, Q1 landed on the Toyota and Nexus markets. The market share of this landed market reached 41. 8%.

The Toyota part is in total Q1. The number of landing stations has arrived. 32441 units. Then Nexus has arrived. 8613 units. The overall market segment of Q1 in 2025 has reached 39%.

That's Toyota and Nexus. The ratio is up to 36%. That's the same. That's better than 35% of the total revenue in 2024. That's in the consolidated revenue.

We. In March 2025 to 309 billion. That YY was about to grow. That was also 3%. The steady growth of the dynamic. That revenue in Taiwan reached 2753 billion.

The growth of the YY is also up to 2%. That's where the payment is received. Quality is here. We can see in March 2025. The delay rate is up to 1.56.

That ratio follows. Last December 2024. About the constant. That is the part of the amount. We have a slight decrease. There is a slight decrease in this.

There is a slight decrease. There is a slight decrease. The combined revenue here reached 60.86 million. That's the part of YY. It's pretty much the same. It's also a slight addition here.

In the last quarter of the year, keep moving forward. Predict that we are part of the quality of this asset. In fact, it is different. The performance of this quarter is consistent with what the quarter said.

In fact, it is in Taiwan. We can see the quality of the entire asset. More pre-set so-called pre-set amount to see. In fact, there is improvement. In fact, it is. Last quarter.

Our. Taiwan's pre-placement ratio is about 1.3 better. In fact, this season will also drop to 1.2 better. That's slightly from 1.55 to 1.56. It was the last time we shared it with you in Maao and God. In fact, it was in mainland China.

There is also a slight rise. From the previous quarter there were about 3 better ones. 3. 2 better ones. Up to 4. 1 better ones.

That's the main reason why, in addition to the GDP of the continent, growth slows.

Some of these are related, some are receivables, because of the continental region, we begin this year.

This is a tactic of growth. It is considered that the so-called quality of the asset is not heavy, so the receivables part is due to the growth of the reaction slightly reduced.

The denominator decreases. The pre-set is slightly higher. I look at the pre-set amount as a whole. In fact, it's very good. So here we are. Finally.

This is the first time I've done this, thanks for the Q&A. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Here is the transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs: Next we go into the Q&A stage. I want to remind you of the advances in investing: If you have any questions, you can enter the point of this point in the next point there will be a slide screen, slide in the next point there will be a Q&A, so please enter your questions in the field of investment advanced, then click on us, then we will complete the agreed reply, thank you.

First of all, the first question is, what is the impact of financing legislation on the company's future. So the first question I came up with briefly to answer is that the actual financing legislation is not currently in place, because in fact, the government launched the so-called consumer financial protection law, which is basically our own average of our company, because in the second half of last year, the whole method began to be discussed by this leasing peer union, so some of our internal practices, including its emphasis on the four aspects of transparency of this contract, as well as KYC and the rationalization of this amount, so in fact, we all are in accordance with these guidelines, so there is a slight adjustment to complete, so this year is expected to be implemented in August or September this year. In the first quarter of this year, we can only slightly report the actual growth of the part of our corporate finance, which, of course, includes our subsidiary progress and theoretical new business growth is about 20% more than the same period last year, which is actually very large, because corporate finance is likely to be around 70%, the second is the so-called pre-owned car loan decline 30 to 40%, it is the most important part of our category because in fact, our old car loan has the original capital of the car, the first quarter of the year, or the last part of the original capital of the car, is very large, so we can see that recession is actually caused by these original agricultural products, this year is really our growth goal in Taiwan.

In fact, in the first part of the question, we have actually improved from the fourth quarter of last year, in part, between Taiwan and mainland China.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be retained sentence-by-word at the same time to make the overall read more easily.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the general structure and topic of the content. It looks like a meeting record about the company's finance and business development, involving revenue changes, green energy layout, tariff impact, and gross profit margin analysis. Next, I need to identify the conversion points between different topics for proper segmentation. There is a clear separation between timestamps and sentences in the transcript, and I need to group these sentences logically. For example, the discussion of the continent, the impact of Iran's revenue, the development of green energy layout, the impact of tariff negotiations, and the analysis of gross profit margin should be different topics. It should be noted that some sentences may belong to the same topic but are separated by timestamps, such as the part of Iran's revenue, and need to merge relevant sentences.

At the same time, the duplicate "thank you" part may need to be processed separately, but the user requests not to be deleted, so it must be kept in full and may need to be separated or merged. During the processing process, I will check the vacancy part in the timestamp, for example (e.g., 2179. 96-2180. 96 to 2184. 96-2187. 96) need to check if it belongs to the same paragraph, but depending on the content, it may belong to different parts and therefore need to be handled separately.

In addition, pay attention to the consistency of sentences to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, after discussing the gross profit margin, the next questions and answers should be taken as new paragraphs. At the same time, the duplicated "thank you" may need to be merged into a paragraph, but the user request is not deleted, so it must be kept all and may need to be listed separately. Finally, I will read the whole conversion of the paragraph typed transcripts to check for compliance with all the requirements of the user, make sure that no sentences are missing, and that the paragraphs are broken reasonably, keeping the original text intact and accurate.

In fact, the first quarter of the year has been reversed. We think that this is going to continue. Some of the continents we estimate should be reversed by the second or third quarter. The main thing is that we now have this loan on the continent, and we have taken a more positive response after the loan on the pre-lender.

What is the second point about this year's revenue in terms of deducting the Iran-related revenue impact signal, and what is expected of the year's negative revenue change direction? Is it possible to show a delay? We can see that the actual time for the Iran sale is in August last year, in other words, about the third quarter. That's why Iran, its total revenue is probably about monthly revenue, as well as 400 million of our Dutch penny lenders.

The third update is that we want to move forward in this year's green development goal, the acquisition of power assets, and the increase of photoelectric stock holdings. That this year's green layout part, we also hope that in the past, we can continue to see this in the solar energy part, can not reach the goal of signing a hundred. So of course, we are mainly in the green part, this year's revenue growth is relatively fast, because this year's revenue is about 200, so compared to the same period last year about 45% growth.

If you have any questions, you can point to the next section, and then there is a new Cisco system, and then there is a Q&A section, then there is a problem to enter your Q&A. Okay, we go into the next section, under the Taiwan-US tariff negotiations, if you adjust the tariff on automobile imports or cargo taxes, ask the truck company's limited operation, is there any impact? Thank you.

But because of our company, the main thing is to do the financing of the vehicle, according to the previous experience, when the vehicle sales is not too much impact, often the so-called promotion rate, so the impact of our vehicle financing is not necessarily negative, this can be reflected in our first quarter, in fact, our vehicle's status will also be affected, because we are not really affected by the increase in the number of frames, this is the case.

The third reason is just to report to you, because the fact that this contract action has contributed to our revenue in the past, but the fact that the contract action is considered to be a little detrimental to our gross profit, so that if this part is removed, the gross profit margin is actually slightly increased. The footprint of the gross profit margin is rising, in fact, we think it is possible, because if this trend continues, there is no special systemic risk, I think this gross profit margin should be able to continue to rise. Thank you. Is there any other questions for investors? Is there any other questions?
