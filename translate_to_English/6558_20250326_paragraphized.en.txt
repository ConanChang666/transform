<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user's user-interrupted format to the paragraph type. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I observe the verbatim content provided. It looks like every line is a duplicate request that the audience likes, subscribes, forwards, and rewards support shows. Time stamps start at 0.00, repeats every 30 seconds until the end of 2639. 98 seconds.

There are about 88 entries in total, and each entry is the same, but the timestamp is different. The user wants to combine these duplicate sentences into paragraphs, but does not delete anything. Since all sentences are the same, the combined paragraphs may appear long, but the user explicitly requests not to be deleted, so all duplicate sentences must be retained. However, the user may want to combine the same content sentences into one paragraph, but according to the rules, no sentences can be deleted, so it may be necessary to combine all duplicate sentences together to form a long paragraph.

But according to the user's requirements, all sentences must be kept together, so they can only be separated by line, but the user's request is paragraph, and may need to merge all sentences into a paragraph, with a clause in the middle, but there are no clauses in the original sentence, so the sentences may need to be added. However, the user may want to merge all the duplicate sentences into a paragraph, with a clause in the middle, or with a line in the middle. However, the user wants to merge the same sentences into a paragraph according to the rules, but cannot delete any sentences according to the rules.

Therefore, the correct way is to combine all sentences together, form a long paragraph, each sentence is separated by a period, but there is no period between the sentences, so the user may need to add a period, or keep the same period. However, the correct way is to combine all the sentences together into a paragraph, with a paragraph separated in the middle. But there is no period, so it may be necessary to add a period, or keep the original, just to separate all the sentences together with a space. Finally, taking into account the user's requirements is not to delete anything, so it is necessary to combine all the duplicate sentences into a paragraph, with a period separated, or keep the original, but may want the user to form a more compact format.

In summary, the process steps are: 1. Combine all duplicate sentences into one paragraph. 2. Add a period after each sentence (if the original sentence doesn't have one). 3. Make sure that nothing is deleted and keep the original sequence. 4. Output as a paragraph, you may need to use a line breakout or a period separator. Now you need to check if there are any exceptions, such as whether timestamps need to be retained.

However, the correct processing is to remove the timestamp, keep only the sentences, and combine all sentences into paragraphs, separated by a sentence, or kept together. However, the original data of the user, each entry contains timestamps and sentences, so it is necessary to confirm whether the timestamps need to be kept. The user does not explicitly state that, according to the task description, the user may want to remove the timestamps, but only keep the sentence content.

However, according to the example provided by the user, it may be more inclined to the latter, i.e., the connection, there is no punctuation in the middle, but the user may want a more readable format, so add a sentence. However, the original data of the user is independent of each entry, may correspond to a timestamp for each entry, so it may be necessary to combine all sentences into a paragraph, add a period after each sentence, and form a long paragraph. For example: Please do not like to subscribe to the forwarding of the support mirrors and dots. Please do not like to subscribe to the forwarding of the support mirrors and dots.

Please feel free to subscribe to receive feedback. After processing it, the user's request is met, all the sentences are kept, merged into a paragraph, separated from each sentence by a sentence. However, it is necessary to confirm whether the user is allowed to add a sentence, but the user does not mention it, so it may keep the original, just linked, and there is no punctuation in the middle.
