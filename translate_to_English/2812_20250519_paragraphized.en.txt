<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must remain the same, just adjust the format. Next, I will check the verbatim content provided. It looks like it contains a lot of financial data and terms that may involve the bank's quarterly report.

First, I need to identify which entries belong to the same topic or the same paragraph. For example, parts of net interest rate, cost-effectiveness ratio, asset quality, etc. may need to be grouped. At the same time, pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the logical order of the paragraphs is correct.

For example, the net interest rate for the low quarter of 2025 and the NIM1.3 33% of entries should be put together. Similarly, the parts of the cost-effective ratio need to integrate all the relevant data points, including the percentage changes and reasons. During the process, there are some possible mistakes or inconsistencies that need to be noted. For example, some entries may contain misspellings or incomplete sentences, such as "long-term immersion ends" or "stitched the dep 길", which may need to be retained as they are, but may need to adjust the format to make them easier to read.

In addition, some timestamps can be duplicated or intermittent and need to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. In addition, the user mentions that the phrase "permanently cut through" may mean that each entry is a separate sentence, but some may just be phrases or incomplete sentences. I need to determine how to combine these phrases rationally into complete sentences without adding anything. For example, "adding $319 billion" may require a combination of the preceding "cash channel" or "financial assets" to form complete sentences. When dealing with financial data, pay special attention to the accuracy of numbers and percentages to ensure that all values and comparisons are correct.

At the same time, make sure that the logical coherence between paragraphs, the correct sequence of time, and the use of the term are consistent. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but according to the user's request, no rewriting or assumptions can be made, only strictly in accordance with the original text. In conclusion, the process requires careful analysis and patience to ensure that fragmented entries are translated into clear structured, easy-to-read paragraph-column transcripts without changing the content. </think> Below is the compiled paragraph-column script (fully retains all the original content, adjusts the formatting and punctuation only):
