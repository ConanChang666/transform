<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice that there are different sentences followed after each timestamp. The user wants to re-arrange these sentences into readable paragraphs, but all sentences must be preserved without any deletion or modification. This means that I need to identify which sentences belong to the same paragraph and which need to be separated. Next, I need to analyze the logical relationship between each sentence and see if there are any natural paragraph divisions. For example, the opening part may include greetings and greetings, then the company introduction and the meeting agenda.

The Q&A section may involve multiple questions and answers that require the integrity of each question and answer. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the sequence of paragraphs is consistent with the original transcription. At the same time, make sure that each sentence remains in its place without missing anything.

In addition, it is important to note that some sentences may be incorrectly separated due to timestamp intervals, such as in the Q&A section, where the user mentions "I haven't heard" multiple times, which may be due to technical issues, but according to the user's request, all content must be retained. Therefore, it is necessary to keep these duplicate sentences in place during finishing, without merging or deleting them. In handling financial data sections, it is necessary to ensure that the numbers and percentages are accurate, such as "2 billion consolidated revenue in the first quarter of 2025" and "207 billion", etc., and these numbers must be presented correctly.

During the process, you may encounter a connection between some sentences that are not smooth enough, such as jumping or repeating content between timestamps. At this point, you need to maintain the order of the original sentence without making adjustments to ensure that the user's requirements are met. For example, the user has multiple "thanks" and repeated confirmation statements in the transcription, all of which need to be retained even if they look redundant. Finally, after finishing, you need to check the entire paragraph transcription to ensure that all sentences are correctly arranged without omissions or errors and that all the user's requirements are met. At the same time, make sure that the format is correct, without using any Markdown, keeping plain text form.

All are welcome to invest in advanced online. Fengtai Enterprise is no longer limited by shares online. In this meeting, the director of Kanghe Securities invited Xu Fang to share the company's business outlook with all walks of life. Today's agenda will be divided into two stages, the first company briefing, the second Q&A exchange.

Mr. Xu please. OK. I confirm again, have you heard the sound? Yes, it is clear. Thank you for your participation.

This time we will update the operation information, first with a few pages to update the operation information. In fact, before we have participated in the legal meeting, this page did not change, because this is all using 2024 data to do the company's basic information update. We are mainly going to ask about our capacity, here is the information is your capacity configuration in each country in 2024, China is 10%, Indonesia is 14%, Vietnam is 46% and India is 30%. Next, is our central financial information for the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, we consolidated revenue of 2 billion, 2072 billion.

The YYC increased by 1%. Our consolidated net operating interest rate was 7% and YYC increased by a percentage. Our consolidated net profit after tax was 6%, then the first quarter of the month's economic cost was 7%. Then the second quarter of the earnings per share was 1.16 pieces. So, if we look at the earnings per share, it is actually 10% less than the same period last year.

So this is what we see here is why the net interest rate is relatively low in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period last year? In fact, there is no big change in the Poly here, there is some increase, but the other is not much change in the business cost, which is mainly in the small increase in business net profit, increased by 4% more than the same period last year. However, in the case of non-operating expenses and expenses, the portion of income is 45% less than last year.

The first quarter of the year is the month of May, and the fourth quarter is the month of May. The first quarter is the month of May, and the second quarter is the month of May. The first quarter is the month of May, and the second quarter is the month of May, and the second quarter is the month of May.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, I didn't hear.

I haven't heard it. No, he's in the chat room, to confirm whether Nike wants to share tariffs on the supply chain. OK, uh, our main customer Nike with us really doesn't have a deal with this Copy, that is, we actually have to deal with our customers every year with a mechanism to negotiate prices, so we will discuss in this mechanism, that we will not only include tariffs, we will be able to increase efficiency, and increase costs, these different factors to discuss, but of course, tariffs how to let each other win, this will be discussed in this mechanism, but it's not often said in this way, for example, customers want the company to pay 5% a 3%, not in this way, so we don't do it in this way.

Shipments for the first quarter of 2025. Well, 2024. And shipments for the first quarter of 2025. Because we don't talk about shipments outside. We don't disclose shipments.

So, I don't find it easy to explain numbers here, so why not talk about shipping amounts, because in fact, we see a lot of changes in blood type.

It's not the same as the past two. So these things can be easier. This will cause more questions. If yes, the shipment is actually the first quarter.

The first quarter of this year compared to the last year. In fact, it was slightly higher than the first quarter of last year. It was slightly higher.

There are good investment companies to ask questions. Ask about the impact of tariffs on the company. What is it? OK I can't say. It must have an impact, so it's in.

We are with the main customers. Talk about the impact of this tariff. The first is, of course, not. Not focus on the cost of materials distributed. Or the shared tariff ratio. Tariff ratio.

That is, if we are to say that we are to do this every year, and that we are to do it, and that we are to do it, and that we are to do it; and that we are to do it, and that we are to do it, and that we are to do it, and that we are to do it.

Speed up production. The adjustment of the configuration of the base. That is, in production. Just like in China, we also see the capacity of our China.

This is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go; this is the way to go.

Like Vietnam and India and Indonesia, one can adapt to tariffs. The first one is actually, in the past few months.

Use other production machines. Produce. That's because writing is more difficult. This order moves from China to Vietnam. Or move to India. He still has a lot of technical skills.

He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us, and He is the one who works for us.

There will be some impact. This is also said to be why the revenue in May is relatively low, because in this process, there will be some decision making.

It's time to go. That's it. The loss of productivity will appear in this process. So I'll say the impact of tariffs.

He did not say anything but that we should be saved, but that we should be saved, and that we should be saved, and that we should be saved, and that we should be saved, and that we should be saved, and that we should be saved, and that we should be saved.

Yes, I would like to request a copy of the company's production base. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Please follow up with an investment legal person to ask.

The customer has made a correction. What is the status of the shipment. Visibility I have been talking about in the past. Three months is relatively clear. Three months order. The six months order is the same.

Because there has always been this mechanism. He has three months and six months of orders, of course. It is a big change. So three months of orders are better. Visibility is better.

I have not been able to see the signs, but I have seen the signs, and I have seen the signs, and I have seen the signs, and I have seen the signs, and I have seen the signs, and I have seen the signs, and the moon, and the moon, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars, and the stars.

In contrast, the first two months have been also less than 10 percent. So legal persons have to ask. We have just mentioned the month of May. Basically, there are many factors that affect it. Because it is also in response to tariffs.

Whether it is a syllogism, a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism, or a syllogism.

So he has different factors that affect May. The revenue of shipping is relatively low, but the future. We are two to three months. Looks like yes. Maybe we will go back to comparison.

Normal levels. Levels like March to April. So I can say May. A relatively different one. Included under the factors. Shipping arrangements.

It's a relatively low situation, but it looks like there will be a difference in the next two to three months. Maybe I'll go back to compare. Normal level, three months later.

We are not afraid of the truth, but we are afraid of the truth, and we are afraid of the truth, and we are afraid of the truth, and we are afraid of the truth.

I hope, although challenging, but this is our goal. Thank you, Mr. Xu, for your kind words.

Now the order visibility. Now the visibility. We think it's a big change. Let's see now. We think it's a big change. Let's see now.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript: [932. 56-943.4. 56] The investor asks a question. [934. 56-936. 56] Fever to P5 out of income. [936. 56-938. 56] Just talking about the interest of the exchange of Taiwan dollars. [938. 56-940. 56] In the first quarter of 25.

[942. 56-944. 56] YY decreased by 40%. [944.4 56-946. 56] This refers to the previous year. [946. 56-950. 56] Foreign currency exchange in Taiwan. [94. 56-950. 56] This year is relatively large. [950. 56-952. 56] Less meaning. [952. 56-954. 56] In other cases, the company will.

[954. 56-956. 56] is a relatively large demand. [960. 56-962. 56] is just right. [962. 56-9664. 56] is the first quarter of 2025. [96. 56-966. 56] is the first quarter of 2024. [966. 56-968. 56] Foreign exchange interest is relatively small. [968. 56-970. 56] First quarter of 2025.

[970. 56-972. 56] In the first quarter, the currency is still changing. [972. 56-974. 56] Yes. [974. 56-976. 56] There is still the meaning of the exchange. [976. 56-978. 56] The amplitude of the exchange is relatively large compared to 2024. [978. 56-980. 56] The amplitude of the exchange is relatively large. [980. 56-982.2. 56] So.

[982. 56-984. 56] I am not mistaken. [984. 56-986. 56] Other countries. [986. 56-988. 56] The exchange rate is also fluctuating. [988. 56-990. 56] That's 2024. [990. 56-99.2. 56] So this is just. [992. 56-994.2] The answer to your question is correct.

[994. 56-996. 56] Then the second. [996. 56-998. 56] The second question is the question. [998. 56-1000. 56] The exchange rate. [1000. 56-1002. 56] What is the exchange rate. [1002. 56-1004. 56] The relatively large impact. [1004. 56-1006. 56] That.

[1006. 56-1008. 56] Basically, the exchange rate. [1008. 56-1010. 56] The exchange rate is our effect. [1010. 56-1012. 56] It is short-term. [1012. 56-1014. 56] It is said. [1014. 56-1016. 56] Because we have customers. [1016. 56-1018. 56] There is a comparison.

[1018. 56-1020. 56] Major customers have other major customers. [1020. 56-1022. 56] is also the same, but with the main customers. [1022. 56-1026. 56] is a relatively real-time. [1024. 56-1026. 56] Adjusts the mechanism according to the exchange rate. [1026. 56-1028. 56] The price mechanism. [1028. 56-1030. 56] So basically.

[1030. 56-1032. 56] Within a month. [1032. 56-1034. 56] Can be adjusted. [1034. 56-1036. 56] Will follow. [1036. 56-1038. 56] Change the price. [1038. 56-1040. 56] To adjust the price. [1040. 56-1042. 56] So.

[1042. 56-1044. 56] Our impact will be short-term. [1044. 56-1046. 56] One-off will be short-term. [1046. 56-1048. 56] Yes. [1048. 56-1050. 56] After this adjustment. [1050. 56-1052. 56] Indeed. [1052. 56-1054. 56] There is no comparison with this part.

[1054. 56-1056. 56] The effect of the exchange rate. [1056. 56-1058. 56] Hello. [1058. 56-1060. 56] Can I hear my voice. [1060. 56-1062. 56] Yes. [1062. 56-1064. 56] I want to ask this. [1064. 56-1066. 56] The exchange rate is of [1064. 56].

[1066. 56-1068. 56] One of the accounting. [1068. 56-1070. 56] Our Taiwan earnings are to be converted. [1070. 56-1072. 56] Taiwan Dollar is to be converted. [1072. 56-1074. 56] Or the company is. [1074. 56-1076. 56] According to the. [1076. 56-1078. 56] Foreign currency on the market.

[1078. 56-1080. 56] Volatility or what. [1080. 56-1082. 56] The reason is to operate. [1082. 56-1084. 56] The actual operation or just accounting. [1084. 56-1086. 56] To do so is OK. [1086. 56-1088. 56] Because our company did not do it. [1088. 56-1090. 56] The wind is relatively.

[1090. 56-1092. 56] In financial operations are very conservative of us. [1092. 56-1094. 56] is basically the board of directors. [1094. 56-1096. 56] is less. [1096. 56-1098. 56] requires derivatives. [1098. 56-1098. 56] Foreign exchange operations. [1100. 56-1092. 56] We do not have this foreign currency operation.

[1102. 56-1104. 56] [1104. 56-1106. 56] So now we are really real in our account. [1106. 56-1108. 56] This is the account. [1108. 56-1110. 56] Also on account. [1110. 56-1112. 56] Accounts payable. [1112. 56-1114. 56] These net USD assets.

[1114. 56-1116. 56] It is lost on account of. [1116. 56-1118. 56] The loss of the exchange is like this. [1118. 56-1120. 56] Thank you. [1124. 56-1126. 56] Invest. [1126. 56-1128. 56] Invest. [1128. 56-1130. 56] Can you hear it?

[1130. 56-1132. 56] I would like to ask. [1132. 56-1134. 56] The one you just said is. [1134. 56-1136. 56] The one who wrote the letter. [1136. 56-1138. 56] The exchange rate is received on the order. [1138. 56-1140. 56] There is a exchange rate and then. [1140. 56-1142. 56] There is another exchange rate after [1140. 56-1142. 56].

[1142. 56-1144. 56] It is your time. [1144. 56-1146. 56] Shipping will be based on that time. [1146. 56-1148. 56] The exchange rate will be adjusted to a price. [1148. 56-1150. 56] It is such a logic. [1150. 56-1152. 56] It seems that this logic does not work correctly. [1152. 56-1154. 56]

[1154. 56-1156. 56] That's another question I'd like to ask. [1156. 56-1158. 56] That's what you just said. [1158. 56-1160. 56] You'll work with the customer to do something. [1160. 56-1162. 56] Capacity distribution. [1162. 56-1164. 56] You can ask about capacity distribution. [1164. 56-1166. 56] When will I tell you about it?

[1166. 56-1168. 56] will adjust to be relatively smooth. [1168. 56-1170. 56] We. [1170. 56-1172. 56] In fact, Q3 will be after that. [1174. 56-1176. 56] We will focus on it. [1176. 56-1178. 56]

[1178. 56-1180. 56] Put it. [1180. 56-1182. 56] Put it. [1182. 56-1184. 56] There is a way to adjust it. [1184. 56-1186. 56] Production is available. [1186. 56-1188. 56] Other countries like Vietnam and India. [1188. 56-1190. 56]

[1190. 56-1192. 56] [1192. 56-1194. 56] Smooth. [1194. 56-1196. 56] I dare not say that this is related to it. [1196. 56-1198. 56] The whole transfer. [1198. 56-1200. 56] I just mentioned it in a good way. [1200. 56-1202. 56] Difficult shoes.

[1202. 56-1204. 56] At the time of dismantling these migrations. [1204. 56-1206. 56] It is more difficult because it is needed. [1206. 56-1208. 56] A lot of it is because of it. [1208. 56-1210. 56] These are still a lot of old-time intensive. [1210. 56-1212. 56] A lot of detail is required. [121212. 56-1214. 56] There is also the matching of molds.

[1214. 56-1216. 56] So. [1216. 56-1218. 56] We can only say that we are now Q3. [1218. 56-1220. 56] This will be the second half of this year. [1220. 56-1222. 56] Our focus is our goal. [1222. 56-1224. 56] So it starts from the third quarter. [1224. 56-1226. 56]

[1226. 56-1228. 56] is now ready. [1228. 56-1230. 56] Because everything is. [1230. 56-1232. 56] Knows it. [1232. 56-1238. 56] All subsequent productions must be prepared in advance. [1234. 56-1236. 56] Another question to ask. [1236. 56-1238. 56] is now.

[1238. 56-1240. 56] The big customer is right there. [1240. 56-1242. 56] is currently open. [1242. 56-1244. 56] Is it a weak one? [1244. 56-1246. 56] That is, [1246. 56-1248. 56] The new CEO comes after that. [1248. 56-1250. 56] Some of his blood types.

[1250. 56-1252. 56] There are some adjustments. [1252. 56-1254. 56] Yes. [1254. 56-1256. 56] The operation of the customer is ours. [1256. 56-1258. 56] It is not easy to comment that we can only refer to him. [1258. 56-1260. 56] He himself is announced. [1260. 56-1262. 56] I only say to himself.

[1262. 56-1264. 56] They speak to themselves outside. [1264. 56-1266. 56] [1266. 56-1268. 56] If I am not mistaken, he speaks to me. [1268. 56-1270. 56] He himself speaks to himself in this season and the next season. [1270. 56-1272. 56]

[1274. 56-1276. 56] Or else. [1276. 56-1278. 56] Decreases the cannabis. [1278. 56-1280. 56] So for the wind. [1280. 56-1282. 56] What we see is also the condition. [1282. 56-1284. 56] Also the head. [1284. 56-1286. 56] We do not see very well.

[1286. 56-1290. 56] It's that one. [1290. 56-1290. 56] We haven't seen the turning point yet. [1290. 56-1290. 56] That's why we say it. [1292. 56-1294. 56] The second half of the year is still just a challenge. [1294. 56-1296. 56] Even though I'm talking about the next three months. [1296. 56-1298. 56] We should also go back to the previous few months' level.

[1298. 56-1300. 56] But let's look back. [1300. 56-1302. 56] We think it is just shocking. [1302. 56-1304. 56] Yes. [1304. 56-1306. 56] Of course, it is a lot of work. [1306. 56-1308. 56]

[1310. 56-1312. 56] But it really is all over. [1312. 56-1314. 56] The market is not good. [1314. 56-1316. 56] I think it is a challenge. [1316. 56-1318. 56] This is part of the customer's order. [1318. 56-1320. 56] The response. [1320. 56-1322. 56] The second question you have is this.

It's hard for me to talk about it. It's clear that there are no data comparisons, because innovation and harmony star has always been Nike's innovation, strength. In fact, the wind is also, because the wind style and Nike is such a long-term partner? Because there is always continuous product innovation and new products, we will continue to show our trend value, so basically we have basically this atmosphere is back, because we really have a lot of discussions, all of these harmonies have a lot of discussions, just to expect more explosive, more chemical products, I think it will take time, and then just talk about the tariff problem, because usually you are the annual premium, for me, if I'm not mistaken, the annual premium is now related to tax, will there be a change in the middle price?

I don't know if it's going to be the same thing, but I don't think it's going to be the same thing. I don't think it's going to be the same thing, so I think it's going to be the same thing. I don't think it's going to be the same thing, but I don't think it's going to be the same thing. I don't think it's going to be the same thing, but I don't think it's going to be the same thing. I think it's going to be the same thing, but I don't think it's going to be the same thing.

Thank you. There was a question on the message board: Nike's new chief executive officer, the new shoe-type development, and then Nike will enter the vendor to clean the shipment, is there a more positive material? The first question I just answered is the shoe-type. The second question is, can you tell me a little more? I don't hear very clear. He said Nike was new to the vendor to clean the shipment, is the material more positive?

So I assume that in the discussion is that there is no return to the power of innovation, then I think it must be, because to show consumers to see different products, must have a different appearance from the material, just because this is said that, like other products, mainly, mainly eroded customers, as people say, such as Rowney, this high-level Rowney really is not the main thing, public tai does not do Rowney, just say that we are not high-end Rowney, so it is difficult for me to say how the Rowney market is doing, and this is not quite a way to explain it.

I think the revenue is just a challenge, because we have to adjust the mechanism with the customer, but it still has some lag on the purple line, so I have to say that it is more difficult, then, the shipping amount we want to be stable, but I must say that it is very stable is our goal, but we are more conservative, this is a challenge.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it must be kept sequentially and arranged into paragraphs in chronological order.

For example, [1712. 56-1714. 56] corresponds to "should take effect", followed by "thank you", "hm", and so on. I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and merge them into natural paragraphs, while keeping the order and content of the original sentence unchanged. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same paragraph. Usually, when the speaker is discussing the same topic, the sentence is arranged together. For example, starting with "should take effect", the next sentence may be in response to a mechanism or question, there may be a new question or topic.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete or need to be combined with the context understanding, but according to the user's request, no rewriting can be made, so it must be retained as it is. In the process, there may be some time between the gap between the tags for a long time, such as [1842.156-1872. 56] there is no content between the contents, which may mean that the speaker has to pause or switch the topic, which may be left blank or otherwise processed, but the user does not specify otherwise, so keep it as it is.

In addition, it should be noted that some sentences may belong to different conversational rotations, such as investor questions and answers, need to be correctly segmented. For example, when "the director has advanced questions" appear, it may indicate that the new question needs to be segmented. Finally, check whether the whole paragraph is smooth, conform to the Chinese reading habits, and ensure that there are no missing sentences.

1. [1712. 56-1714. 56] should be in effect. 2. [1714. 56-1716. 56] Thank you. 3. [1716. 56-1718. 56] Well. 4. [1718. 56-1720. 56] I think. 5. [1720. 56-1722. 56] This is because I just had it. 6. [1722. 56-1724. 56] There is a prospect for an investor.

7. [1724. 56-1726. 56] A mechanism of speaking. 8. [1726. 56-1728. 56] Basically. 9. [1728. 56-1730. 56] Basically. 10. [1730. 56-1732. 56] We all know that the quote must have a certain exchange rate... When combining these sentences into paragraphs, it is necessary to consider logical consistency. For example, sentence 5-7 may be to explain a mechanism, followed by sentence 8-9 to repeat, which may indicate emphasis, and then enter into a discussion about exchange rates.

After that, there may be new questions or answers that require segmentation. During the process, encountering a duplicate "basic" needs to be retained, which may indicate the speaker's emphasis or repeat. At the same time, paying attention to the interval between timestamps, such as [1842. 56-1872. 56] without content, may indicate a pause, leave blank during processing or otherwise. Finally, make sure that all sentences are arranged correctly, and there are no omissions or errors.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

A mechanism to speak. Basically. Basically. You know that the quote must have a exchange rate. You can quote a exchange rate. That may be the exchange rate of the quote.

That is, until the end of the production until the shipment. Basically, it will be close to the shipment. Close to the shipment. I can't speak too specific. It is the closest to the shipment.

Yes, it is possible to do it again. It is OK. There will be a fundraising event like this again. There will be a recurrence of the process. So it really is for us.

We have seen that the month of Ramadan is the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan is the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan is the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan is the month of Ramadan.

This is so short a time. In such a short period of time, the decline and appreciation of that mechanism, I just talked about it. It is impossible to cover. May is more like one.

There is no time limit for cover. So it's much bigger. It's a call to our company. From production to shipping. We know every money. No.

That's what we say. One of ours. It's just this lead time. It's about time. It's about time. Well, it's because lead time is included.

It's time to start buying a ticket. Or until it's time to start buying a ticket. That's the material we want to ask. We're going to prepare the material for a long time. We're ready to ship when we're ready.

We split it into two sections. Well, that's a lot different from the blood type. But average if it's normal.

Two months later, two months later, two months later, two months later, two months later, two months later, two months later.

We should be in a month. Ok thanks. The director has advanced investment questions. Please ask our prices will be adjusted according to the exchange rate.

This is why I've just answered, so it should be good to be able to move forward, and then it's good to be on vacation right now, and we're more experienced than before.

When the time comes, when the time comes, when the time will come, and the time will come; when the time will come, and the time will be at hand, and we will be like one another.

I am not sure if it is a long time to produce shoes, so I am not sure if it is a leisure time, which is to say, what kind of.

Shoes, shoes, what kind of shoes we have, because we have a number of shoes every day, shoes, what kind of shoes, what kind of shoes.

Well, if this is the case, then there is a problem that can be supplemented. There is a problem that can be supplemented. Thank you, Chief.

There is also an investment legal person to ask. He said. May byte opmatch teaching package. Can it be extended. Because he looks at the second half of the profit. Good.

The month of Ramadan is the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan.

I'm going to say two things, one of the main reasons, the first I think, I really see that we're going to make this paragraph.

Production of this paragraph is our past. We have been controlling costs. Here is the result with the improvement of efficiency. So we are producing this paragraph. . Profits have increased.

This is the main reason for this. Then again, of course, there is the new factory. Our new factory is 2020, there are two new factory and he.

The loss is a loss, but the loss is a loss, and the loss is a relatively small loss, so the two main factors are the main reason for the production of these two factors.

The second part is really about managing costs. Because we have some issues with fees. Some issues with fees include bonuses.

He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest.

Profits. Old, so we have some bonuses. Tidings as well. It has decreased a lot, so it's just these two factors.

Let OKMARK. Make it even more. Good director has to invest. Please ask for the next term. The gross interest rate of the scholarship is on the average.

What is the value of the company like? Look at this year. The duration of the gross profit margin. Well, it's transient because we're only the first year.

The second year later, he also told us that it is a new business. New business. So we will. Other gross profit margins will follow.

Yes, that's right. The shoes are very small. We hope that's not the case at the moment, so I just said that our heart is still losing.

We will see, and we will be able to see.

Gross interest rates are similar to that of running shoes. Levels. Of course, he has. Cross-time pricing. His price is relatively low. Absolute amount is less.

The amount of time spent on it is less than the amount of time spent on it; this is the amount of time spent on it.

If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. If you are looking for the best shoes for you, this is the perfect choice for you. This is not easy to answer, because, coming to the product, I from a long time ago, this is difficult to go, a very product face, the second is that it is involved in the direction of the customer, then I see the distance is very big, that is just said, I see the current situation, in fact, basketball shoes except JODEN, because JODEN is a separate brand, so we also see Nike, always, and of course, Nike or athletes, its core value or athletes, so it is still athletes, to want to do new, new series, just say, this series may not be so famous, if the general people, not do this, but also have a lot of series of we have done long, that there will be some new, some new shoes, there will be done, these signature shoes, this is the only part of us can go back, this, this is the main focus, whether we have a new ball, or not to the ballet, if it is a new, if it is a new, if it is a new, whether it is a new, it is a new, whether it is a new, we will be, whether it is a new ball is a new ballet, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, we will be, or a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new ballet, or not, we are not we are not, whether it is a new ballet, we are, we will be, whether it is, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new ball is a new, or not, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, we are, we are, whether it is a new, or not we are, we are, we are, whether it is a new, whether it is a new ball is a new, whether it is a new, or not we are a new ball is a new ball is a new, whether it is a new, we are, whether it is, whether it is, whether it is a we are, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a new, whether it is a we are, or not we are Thank you very much, I think we can talk about it in the first quarter of the year, the main customer ratio, the main customer ratio, in fact, it is almost the same, the first quarter, I may, the first quarter, the first quarter, I think, we have said in the past.

Nike's Full Wear is 85%. It's probably 85%. But I'm not that bad. Because I don't really have a clear data. It's just that it's possible because we're here.

One of our other customers, Solomon. Solomon. The share of 2024 is about 6%. The share of 2024 is actually. We expect to be the share of 2025.

A little up. Because of Solomon's brand. Its growth is relatively rapid. We expect it to actually happen this year. It may have it compared to 2024. Two-digit growth.

So I think the percentage of the first quarter. There will be some small changes, but it's not too big. But I just don't have specific data to tell you about it.

There is also a question for legal persons. Ask for the May OP Margin upgrade. Even the new factory. Reduce the loss. Reduce the bonus fee. Reduce the contribution amount.

The bonus fee is reduced by about how much contribution. See in percentages. See in percentages. It should be. It may be difficult to say specific. This is because it is only.

As a percentage, more than half of it comes from production. That's productivity. More than half of it comes from new factory courses.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your comments. The above message board has been completed. If there is any investment legal person, please leave a message. Thank you.

Please, please. Adjust the production base. Will China's share decrease again. China's share decrease again. Will China's share decrease again. Will it fall to none.

It's now 10%, I'm here, and I'm sure I'll just have to add to it. We're in China's factory.

"We are not going to do it, we are not going to do it, we are not going to do it, because we have been in China for more than 30 years.

We believe in Him, but we do not believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him, nor do we believe in Him.

High-tech, high price. Quality and efficiency. All are very good. So the first one can be used, of course, there is domestic sales. We try our best to the future is domestic sales.

Then there's the idea. Some of these higher-tech prices, to fight, so there's a lot of opportunities in the future.

But it won't let him have China's production capacity. So it was beginning to mention some high-tech products to move out. I remember that China used to be doing this high-tech high-priced thing. So you wanted to move him to Vietnam. Is Vietnam the burden of Vietnam will increase again.

I'd like to ask if you're working with Nike's production rate is adjusted. You want to increase India, Indonesia, or Vietnam.

Basically, we're. We're in our own every year. We're going to talk about a sequence, which means China is the most technically difficult.

We can gradually undertake high technical difficulties. So basically will undertake China first. Definitely will be the team in Vietnam. Under this, of course, we will have some.

Some to Indonesia, some to India, maybe Vietnam, or some co-operatives, can make good use of Indonesia again. After that, we will reconfigure again. India's production capacity. So all of these will go.

We are all moving. Everyone is going to be moving in this whole distribution production probability. This is the way to do this. Just say the direction must be. Of course, we are going to be in Vietnamese.

This is the word of the Lord, which is written in the book of life, and it is written in the book of life; it is written in the book of life of the Lamb, and it is written in the book of life of the Lamb; it is written in the book of life of the Lamb, and it is written in the book of life of the Lamb, and it is written in the book of life of the Lamb.

We have been in Taipei for a long time, although 2023 to 2024. Our order is actually a little less.

The wind is not a fart from Layoff. We probably rely on the natural loss rate. It is the balance between man and order. So it is. It is the balance between man and order.

It was a long time for us to do this, but I saw it on my own, and I thought it would be useful for Vietnam now, because it is basically not enough for us to have human resources.

That's why. Your problem is yours. We'll be mainly in Vietnam. We'll just say the probability of production of all this movement. The transportation of Indonesia will be waiting. And then we'll plan a better one.

Mr. Kiku. I would like to ask you a question. For tariffs, Vietnam 46%. It is comparable to Indonesia or India. It is relatively unfavorable.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, "The best among you are those who do not know the truth, but those who do not know the truth, and those who do not know the truth are those who do not know the truth."

Or, if it is not, it is not a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end, or a sign of the end?

There is no such thing as a righteous person, no matter what they say, and we have no way of knowing what they are saying.

I think of myself, because I see the current situation, and I want to go to Vietnam.

And most of them are in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat, or in the same boat.

Yes. Quality and efficiency are not. In fact, it is for the brand. It is also very difficult to supply demand. So I think it is here.

It's a two-way conversation. That's going to be according to. It's a real supplier. He's the ability to produce machines. Let's arrange. We've got our suggestions.

So I'm just saying it's going to be okay. India Indonesia is moving together. We can't see it. Our own journal is also writing. India is also gradually building a middle-class shoe style.

It's hard to say, but that's what India is all about, and I'm only talking about it.

It is not really 46% of Vietnam. It is one of the biggest judgments because most of the shoes are actually in Vietnam. All are produced in Vietnam. According to the brand's words.

He won't say after that, just like Trump's idea. Say I want this shoe. For example, there is no possibility of automation, there is no possibility of moving. You Asian region.

I've come to Mexico, or where to go to produce, this is a topic that the brand has been thinking about.

It's been a long time since Nike was founded. It's been years since it was founded. It's been in Mexico. It's a shoe automation.

At the time, he was very busy and we were able to provide him with the technology.

Technology. Technology. That's where the resources are. That's what I forgot. Specifically, it's been around for years.

And he said unto them, This is the interpretation; this is the interpretation; this is the interpretation; this is the interpretation; this is the interpretation; this is the interpretation; this is the interpretation.

This is not the case, so the brand should know. uh uh uh uh hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu dun hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu

This supply chain is very difficult. It is difficult to tie up because there is no material manufacturer in India. That's what happens in Mexico, so I guess.

And when he had done so, he said to them, "Do not do any good, nor do any evil, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any evil, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good, nor do any good.

Or do they have a great deal of work to do, and a great deal of work to do, and a great deal of work to do, and a great deal of work to do, and a great deal of work to do.

Just in case you don't have to produce in Vietnam. But here you have some. Supply chain section. You can't always come from China. That's what the current company received. The message is there.

What is the way of printing? Basically, I have a lot of materials manufacturers, all in Vietnam and India, he has the ability to publish, so he has no ratio, I just said.

We are now coming from China from this China material. The proportion is about a lot. Well, I remember this proportion, but it affects it.

Partly limited, because China's materials. Because only some special things are to China. China to produce. So limited. Because many material suppliers.

He was born in Vietnam and in India, but there are some really yes. It is limited in China, but I don't remember much about it.

I do not know what is in it, but I do know what is in it, and I do not know what is in it.

"This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from Me, and their righteousness is from Me, and their righteousness is from Me," says the Lord.

I'm going to put the basketball shoes on the table, maybe I'm not going to put them together.

So Jodan has a lot of fun, so I put the two of them together, and the two of them share, and I can't say a clear share.

It's just that it's also an important proportion. It's not to 50%. It's not to 50%. It's just that it's also an important proportion. So it should be a part of our development ability. So it's going to be our blue shoes and JODAN.

All of our main series are mainly the series. I played 50,000 companies. 1st place. Silver sales proportion. Silver sales proportion.

Xiaomei silver sales ratio. Xiaomei silver sales ratio should be close to 40%. About 40% up and down. Similar to Nike its own market sales range. Have a question about solarman gold rice has a wooden pipe share. Jinmi.

Silver sales accounted for less than my goal. Just to say we were 6% last year. Today we expect some double digits to rise. Well thank you to JODAN. JODAN has students asking. What is the number of direct employees in the first quarter of the year?

Then is there a plan to add a new employee in the second half of this year? Just ask the number of employees. OK No, I didn't count the number of employees. But basically it should be.

Because we didn't have a one-time Layoff employee since 2024. So we are. Natural churn rate. Natural churn rate. So we really don't compare. So we shouldn't increase.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. But I don't mention how much percentage. Excuse me. Well, is there a plan for adding members in the second half of this year? Excuse me, please tell me again. Will there be a plan for adding members in the second half of this year?

In addition to the new factory, there are two new factories in 2024, which will continue to expand this year, and it is an easy new factory far away. In these two factories will also, because the expansion will increase the staff. That, but this part of the expansion, I don't think it will actually be very soon. So apart from these two factories have added other, we won't, basically we are not enough.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. I have a question before, please take the time, thank you. OK, if you don't have a question, please ask.

Yes, yes, yes. Nike has mentioned that tariffs will increase the consumer price, which leads us back to improving the OEM. Will we increase the OEM price? Thank you.

This is not true. Because I have just said that we are in this year, we are in this bargain mechanism, in fact, we will go together to discuss how to go together to share the different costs of this part of the good.

Thank you. Felicia. That's right. Thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

OK. If you don't have a question, we will invest in advanced questions. Today, the public limited company, the online visitor instructions will mention a paragraph. We once again thank the director Xu Fangwei for the special exchange with you, and thank you for the advanced conversation. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you.
