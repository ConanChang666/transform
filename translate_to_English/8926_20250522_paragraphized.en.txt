Below is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph type: Hello everyone. Today we are honored to invite you to share with us a brief overview of the company's response. Next, we will give Mr. Chen our time. Today, according to the example or our finance department's weekly manager for Q1, we will give you a simple report and explain. Next, I will follow you on the important business situation of the company.

In the first quarter of 114, the combined revenue of the company was about 19.4 billion, which was less than 0.500 million. This is mainly because of the progress of the project revenue listed in 114 this year. However, in terms of gross profit, the year 114 Q1 has been 2.1.3 billion, which is about 0.3 billion more than the same period last year.

This is a year-over-year growth. That is currently about 0.4% per share. The second time in terms of balance sheet, the total assets of the company are about 273 million and then the debt is about 116 billion. The current combined debt ratio is about 42.5%.

The focus is on the increase in the income of the project. In addition, in terms of debt, the bigger the change should be in the current debt here, probably an increase of about 2.5 billion. This principle is mainly because the company has 1.9 billion payable corporate bonds due in August this year, so from non-current liabilities to current liabilities.

The financial structure is still solid. Let's take a look at our cash flow statement. The cash flow of this period's business activities is about 14.6 billion, and some are the cash flow of the company's operations.

In addition, the cash flow in financing activities is about 500 million, which is mainly to repay a FRCV due. The company uses free capital to pay off it. That cash at the end of the end of Q1 until the end of March is still 27.86 million. The funds raised 5 times. The latest company operating revenue in April 114 was about 30.36 billion, which is still slightly less than the same period last year, nearly 500 million.

That last look at our nearly five years of dividend distribution. The average yield is about 4.6% or more. In 113, we estimated that the cash dividend would be around 2.1 billion per share. But this is only to report the shareholders' meeting here to pass the reasonable. That is to say, I simply made a few simple reports on the company's finances. In the operating part of the company, first of all, the company's Kanda plant, in the short term or to improve the fuel capacity of film and SRF alternative fuels to reduce the operating costs of the entire Kanda plant.

In order to reduce the use of coal, we are going to start charging the carbon costs generated this year from next year. In order to reduce our carbon costs, we are also applying for this self-reduction program. This will be applied in the next two months. If passed, we can apply for a self-reduction plan from another industry. By this way, we can reduce our carbon costs from 300 yuan per ton to 50 yuan per ton.

It can be effective to reduce our carbon expenditure and emissions. It can be effective to reduce our carbon expenditure and emissions. Of course, the medium and long-term part of this coal is to further reduce the use of net-zero carbon emissions. The purpose of net-zero carbon emissions. In the future, we will consider whether to change the current Guanda gas plant in South America to a fully gas-fired cogeneration plant.

This part is currently being evaluated. We will also continue to try to negotiate the relevant issues related to the extension of the PPA. There is no progress at this stage in the Fair Trade Law and Fair Trade Law of Private Power Plants, and there is still no progress at this time. However, the various IPPs and Fair Trade will continue to follow this mediation process to see if there is any chance to further reduce the sanctions on our circulars.

In the corporate governance section, at the end of April.

The stock exchange has announced the evaluation of all listed companies in 113 years, which we have returned to the top five in the next part of the investment, I only have to report the changes, then in the next part of the investment, I have not repeated, there are more changes, is a good news part, with all investors to do a report. First of all, the private power plant, the two phases, you may know that we are also in the second phase of the power program, the program is already on May 15, on May 15, has been issued power license by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and also May 20, after the registration of the company, began this business operation on May 20, and then will indirectly have some positive impact on the profit of the TB. In the future, we will continue to invest in the renewable energy, and there will be no further progress, but there will be no further discussion, that is, the renewable energy sales of electricity is the same, that is, the ongoing efforts to fight the relevant business, the details of the part is no longer discussed, so I think Tiande, regardless of the financial or important business overview, with you to report here, we have left the rest of the time to invest in advanced friends, to see if there is no problem with the company here, to do a communication with each other, now to leave the time to the advanced friends, good thank you for the detailed introduction of Chen, then we can enter Q&A time, welcome to invest in advanced can not be silenced to ask questions, refuel. This is what I understand from Mr. Zhao: You are a banker, in principle not wrong, the gross profit of the project, must be much lower than the gross profit of our investment, so we can see that our revenue growth, with our profit growth may be the same direction, but it is not necessarily the same, if as just mentioned, is not the same as mine, the company's earnings in terms of revenue, most of our electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, electricity, gas, electricity, electricity, electricity, gas, electricity, gas, electricity, electricity, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas,

Mr. Chen, can you see the question of the message area, you can, we are now looking at the screen, thank you, Zhi Jie, Zhi Jie, on you first supplement, then I wait, a brother in the declaration of secondary, the second half of this second half of the year began to invest in the transfer, for the benefit of our second half, must have.

The second question and the first question is, what is the price of electricity, of course, the higher the price of the summer, the profit of the company will grow, this is no problem, but I think the digital principle of the company is more inconvenient to announce, this first point is probably the first point. In the light of the country really don't want to look into the power supply, I may go further equity-funding program, but at this time we have this plan, but this principle is still going to lead to the picture, and then the other investment plan with the company, his sum will be a more robust financial planning, and if there are some decisions, we will make some decisions.

The first one is about our gas prices and electricity prices, and now it seems that the gas prices and electricity prices do not have a lot of fluctuations, I do not know the second half of the general manager on the gas prices and the trend of electricity prices, it is likely that this is not a good prediction, because a positive environment of the gas prices is likely to be difficult to predict, the teacher I just said gas prices, the part of the gas prices actually see two sides of the talk, because now the coal price is also rising, the coal price is also rising, and now the price of oil prices are falling, some people say that the gas prices will reflect the price of the oil and coal, there will be a reaction, but there is also a party said that because the oil gas prices in the past part of this part of this part of the loss, which may be reflected the decline of this gas prices, so it may not necessarily follow the so called the trend of the international gas prices, consistent, so, so that this part of this information can only to investors for investment reference, the better.

It should be last year, from last year, the government for this part of the refrigeration, so basically it has followed the general power generation gas price, almost to the power generation is very close, then this is the key air purifier is a positive effect, is a positive effect, because the steam user currently sold to the key manufacturers is to use the gas price to link, so the gas price to increase the price of our customers will have a positive effect, it will improve, that our revenue and profitability will have a positive effect, above. We look at the following idea, we will see what we are now talking about, we say now, this is the second phase of the style, in principle in June 2024 before the license, his glass performance, it looks like less expected, so I don't know what is expected, the next time is called these opening fees and some kind of the next month of the first, so it will be able to give us the first.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript: [1361-1365. 38] Depreciated within 25 years. [1365.1 38-1369. 34] The natural capacity rate comes in after that. [1369. 34-1371. 60] Because most of us are now. [1371. 60-1379. 40] The rate for PPA bids is set. [13791. 40-1393. 44] This part of the investment amount is called this part.

[1383. 44-1386. 04] is where the capacity rate is to be recycled. [1386. 04-1388. 90] The profit is also in this structure. [1388. 90-1391. 28] This part of the capacity rate is to be recycled. [1391. 28-1393. 20] is the amount of our investment. [1393. 20-1395. 30] is the amount of our investment in this 2nd issue. [1395. 30] is the amount of our investment in this period. [1395. 30-1393. 42] will be the amount of our investment.

[1397. 421-1398. 38] Acquired. [1398. 38-1400. 84] So start from May 20. [1400. 84-1404. 40] Slowly we can put our investment in the funds. [1404. 40-1405. 78] And our profit. [1405. 78-1409. 46] Can be started to reflect on the 2nd issue. [1409. 46] Above.

[1409. 96-1414. 58] Prime Minister you follow the previous question. [1414. 58-1416. 26] So that is not a representative is to say. [1416. 26-1420. 20] The portion of the rate that has decreased in the past about 9 months. [1420. 20-1421. 16] In that case, [1421. 16-1423. 72] is not that. [1423. 72-1424. 48] This does not mean that.

[1424. 48-1427. 04] This is the months before. [1427. 04-1428. 84] He only gave the energy rate. [1428. 84-1431. 92] The energy rate was because we took the time to schedule. [1431. 92-1434. 72] So basically it also required some. [1434. 72-1436. 78] Of course, natural gas. [1436. 78-1438. 56] Fuel costs he would give us.

[1438. 56-1442. 16] The fee that contains some of our changes will be given to us. [1442. 16-1447. 52] But so there is actually a profit during this time period. [1447. 52-1449. 58] I mean that every time there is a profit. [1449. 58-1450. 86] It depends on what rates he has lost. [1451. 16-1452. 24] The words. [1452. 24-1453. 66] This is true.

[1453. 66-1459. 28] Be able to say 11 points. [1459. 28-1459. 66]. [1459. 66-1463. 16] Be able to do so. [1463. 70-1465. 76] But this зрор. [1468. 82-1469. 84] If [1469. 84-1471. 12] is not necessary.

[1471. 12-1472. 34] Sure. [1472. 34-1473. 44] handicapped. [1473. 44-1474. 66] habe [1474. 66-1475. 52] powder pure. [1475. 52-1476. 00] That is. [1476. 00-1476. 80] That's fine. [1476. 80-1477. 36] He earns money.

[1477. 36-1477. 74] You see. [1477. 74-1478. 56] I live. [1478. 56-1479. 26] I see more than I see. [1479. 26-1480. 28] To earn Gerald. [1480. 28-1480. 74] Chen. [1481 16-1483. 46] Settlement is settled.

[1483. 46-1487. 66] That will not go back to what you just mentioned. [1487. 66-1490. 16] The future to supplement these nine months will not. [1490. 16-1493. 40] Because the 20th of May begins. [1493. 40-1496. 60] Enter the truly so-called business operation. [1496. 60-1500. 48] It will be collected at the price of the PPA. [1500. 48-1502. 54]

[1502. 54-1506. 26] So the so-called first 9 months of the problem has not been supplemented. [1508. 12-1509. 96] Well. [1509. 96-1512. 96] is also part of the related Guoguang phase. [1512. 96-1516. 64] Because there will be a unit due in March 2028. [1516. 64-1520. 24] That's because the second phase is actually here. [1520. 24-1522. 74] This project has been dropped.

[1522. 74-1526. 58] So now the future of Guoguang Phase 1 is there. [1526. 58-1529. 72] PPA is possible after expiration is extended. [1529. 72-1531. 44] or should it be shut down. [1531. 44-1534. 16] It is directly accepted by phase 2 here. [1534. 16-1539. 96] Guoguang Phase 1 according to PPA should be until October 117. [1539. 96-1543. 16] November 117.

[1543. 16-1550. 54] According to the time of our EIA in this period of Guoguang II. [1550. 54-1552. 98] It is also mentioned. [1552. 98-1558. 68] It is said that the time of Guoguang II. [1558. 68-1562. 58] The EIA phase must be stopped. [1562. 58-1565. 82] This is our commitment to EIA. [1565. 82-1569. 96] It is a good thing about Guoguang II.

[1569. 96-1575. 20] will almost certainly be around the end of 117. [1575. 20-1576. 50] will turn up. [1576. 50-1578. 16] will run. [1578. 16-1578. 90] Ring light will run. [1578. 90-1582. 00] So the timing is very close. [1582. 00-1583. 40] is consistent.

[1583. 40-1585. 70] above. [1585. 70-1589. 18] That is the other part of the five million watts of the new energy. [1589. 18-1590. 82] also expires in 2028. [1590. 82-1594. 66] It is not known that the new energy here will not have new targets. [1594. 66-1597. 16] This will take over. [159. 16-1599. 52] The new energy.

[1599. 52-1699. 96] Currently. [1599. 96-1602. 20] It is until March 118. [1602. 20-1604. 56] It is now in the direction of. [1604. 56-1606. 66] How to make a deal. [1606. 66-1610. 44] How to negotiate a deal with the power station. [1610. 44-1613. 14] But this should be considered.

[1613. 14-1616. 14] The whole power supply or domestic power supply. [1616. 14-1618. 44] It contains probably all you know. [1618. 44-1623. 92] The local area is an important area of renewable energy. [1623. 92-1629. 66] There will also be some competition with this renewable energy. [1629. 66-1632. 42] The time will also be based on the current state. [1632. 42-1634. 90]

[1634. 90-1638. 74] New Energy did not make a plan for Phase II. [1638. 74-1640. 34] did not make a plan for Phase II. [1640. 34-1644. 50] was planned on a way to extend the contract. [1644. 50-1647. 08] OK [1647. 08-1649. 12] It was in the relevant part of the gas source. [1649. 12-1651. 04] That's because this was recently passed. [1651. 04-1657. 18] This is what our country might have to invest in Alaska.

[1657. 18-1658. 98] This part of the natural gas pipeline. [1658. 98-1659. 66] This part. [1659. 66-1663. 70] The company's future opportunities to participate. [1663. 70-1666. 40] This information has not yet been received. [1666. 40-1674. 50] This is because it is part of Trump's tariff war. [1674. 50-1678. 58] This is the way of countries and countries.

[1678. 58-1682. 14] Or, of course, it will be the Alaska you just said. [1682. 14-1687. 26] This natural gas mining company negotiations. [1687. 26-1689. 66] But at the moment we do not receive such information. [1689. 66-1693. 10] It says we are going to participate in such an investment. [1693. 10-1694. 10] No thanks. [1694. 10-1695. 10] Good.

[1695. 10-1697. 26] The last question I want to ask the Prime Minister. [1697. 26-1701. 68] is the part where the natural gas plant is switched. [1701 68-1704. 58] Because now we know is the day time. [1704. 58-1706. 84] is basically the next month. [1706. 84-1710. 18] The ratio of solar power generation is relatively high. [1710. 18-1713. 78] This is the part of the fossil fuel.

[1713. 78-1715. 36] The demand is a little lower. [1715. 36-1719. 46] This is actually a switch between day and night. [1719. 46-1721. 52] It is a little more frequent. [1721. 52-1723. 94] I don't know if this is an action. [1723. 94-1727. 64] This profit margin on this side of the company. [172727. 64-1730. 04] It won't have a significant impact.

[1732. 78-1734. 70] What you say is wrong. [1734. 70-1736. 18] It is now. [1742. 28-1743. 22] Okay. [1743. 22-1748. 96] You want to after three or four o'clock in the afternoon. [1749. 46-1753. 86] The generation will gradually decrease. [1753. 86-1758. 00] Then the power supply will be supplied.

[1758. 001-1762. 20] The current gas unit. [1762. 20-1765. 84] There is also a very important feature. [1765. 84-1768. 74] is to supplement this photoelectric. [1768. 74-1773. 78] In order to help reduce power generation. [1773. 78-1775. 06] Complement this part. [1775. 06-1779. 42] So the future of this gas plant.

[1779. 42-1784. 16] The operating model is different from the previous one. [1784. 16-1798. 90] That said, it will not affect us further. [1789. 90-1796. 24] It does not appear to be profitable, regardless of the revenue at present. [1796. 24-1798. 78] The future if the energy is to rise again. [1798. 78-1801. 60] Further increase. [180. 60-1805. 54] Or that this also shows the overall power supply supply.

[1805. 54-1806. 82] Overall power supply. [1806. 82-1808. 88] That you may have. [1809. 42-1812. 62] See also from our report. [1812. 62-1814. 90] See also from IPP's report. [1814. 90-1816. 40] In fact, these years. [1816. 40-1818. 30] IPP's not only us.

[1818. 30-1822. 34] The capacity of each IPP its operation. [1822. 34-1824. 34] The situation of the electric power dispatching. [1824. 34-1827. 84] In fact, it has been maintained in a relative high-end. [1827. 84-1829. 54] And it is not because you just said it. [1829. 54-1834. 12] The development of the optoelectronics has been reduced. [1834. 12-1837. 94] But this situation will continue for a year.

[1837. 94-1839. 42] This is to be seen. [1839. 42-1843. 82] Because we have one photoelectric with all the stationary power. [1843. 82-1847. 80] For example, it is an increase in its power consumption. [1847. 80-1850. 44] or the state of the new unit. [1850. 44-1852. 04] There is a one-way effect. [1852. 04-1855. 34] That is currently seen in gas.

[1855. 34-1858. 88] has not yet been affected by such an effect.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided script fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format.

First of all, I will check the contents of the provided verbatim to see if there is a duplicate or need to pay special attention. For example, there are three phrases that are repeated between [1899. 12-1899. 24] and [1899. 42-1900. 76], "So we see the impact of this industry is big," which may be a misnomer or repeated emphasis, but according to the user's request, it must be preserved as it is. Next, I will analyze the timestamps and the corresponding sentences one by one, and make sure that the sentences are correctly arranged at the conversion.

However, in the example provided by the user, the user may wish to retain the timestamp, but the sentence is merged into a paragraph. For example, the user may wish to merge the continuous sentence into a paragraph but retain the order of the timestamp. However, in the example provided by the user, the user may wish to remove the timestamp, only retain the sentence, and organize them into paragraphs.

For example, combine sentences of the same speaker into paragraphs, but the user does not explicitly state the speaker, so it may be necessary to maintain the structure of the original exclamation point, just remove the timestamp, and arrange the sentence consecutively. However, in the example provided by the user, the user may wish to combine the timestamp and sentence, but in the example provided by the user, the user may wish to remove the timestamp, keep only the sentences, and organize them into paragraphs. Now, I need to deal with the specific transcription content.

First, check whether there are duplicated or need to be adjusted. For example, there are three duplicate sentences between [1899. 12-1899. 24] and [1899. 42-1900. 76] that must be retained. Then, handle the subsequent Q&A sections to ensure that each question and answer is correctly segmented. Next, I will process the timestamp and sentences in a sentence, but the user may wish to remove the timestamp and keep only the sentence.

For example, when the same speaker speaks continuously, merges into a paragraph, and different speakers change the paragraph. It is important to note that there are some possible errors or duplicates in the transcription provided by the user, such as duplicate sentences between [1899. 12-1899. 24] and [1899. 42-1900. 76], as well as the last part of the garbled (e.g., “Ask box deals flies fork”, etc.), these may need to be retained as they are, but the user may wish to handle those garbled.

--- So I will continue to ask the general manager. You are currently using this IPP. It is not because of this one here on renewable energy. It is not like joining and reducing it. It looks like it should be lowered over the years. There is even a chance to increase.

Because you know what it is like to be TSMC right now. No matter how many companies come to Taiwan to set up a factory. Many are relatively high energy consumption industries. So we see the impact of this industry is big. So we see the impact of this industry is big.

So we see that the impact of this industry is huge. So I just said it. It won't be high or low utilization. In addition to the renewable energy settings you just said, there is a lot of energy in Taiwan.

It's growing. That's when electricity grows quickly. Even if there are more renewable energy sources. That's when IPP or other generators say it's a relatively high-end utilization. Thank you, General Manager.

The general manager wanted to ask about the Alaska investment case in the United States. This investment case may still be an unspecified situation. But we have determined that it is going to increase the purchase of natural gas in the United States. That part of what you think will affect TSMC's profitability. Thank you. I don't know what you don't know.

I've always thought about it. I'm talking about it. But there are a few different changes. We talked about it before our IPP. The price of gas rises. In fact, it's positive for our existing or previous IPP revenues.

That's where the new unit comes in. The impact of this part is relatively low. But at least it won't be because of our IPP's energy space.

The price of natural gas will be adjusted with the price of natural gas. Therefore, the price of natural gas will fall. In fact, the influence of IPP is not very high. Of course, the reason I used to be high is that I had to share with you all before.

When the unit. The unit we use is a bit more efficient. It is a bit more efficient than the one set at the time of opening. So this part will be a bit less efficient. The efficiency difference is reflected in the gas price. The gas cost is in the fuel cost.

We will have a little favor. Then the new part of this favor is no longer nearly enough. However, the price of gas increases early, or we will have a little benefit.

But at least, there is a slight disadvantage to reducing it. But in the end, we go to Taiwan to buy Alaskan natural gas. Will it be the price of natural gas imported from the whole country? Or the price of natural gas sold to IPP. Will it be positive or negative.

It will be increased or decreased. Now it is impossible to see it. So it is only possible to do this analysis at this time. Thank you so much. Please have a question about the advances in investing.

We have an approximate schedule for a political plan here in Guoguang II. When do the funds need to be in place? No, in principle, this year. In principle, this year there will be a larger political forecast. That may be every year.

According to the financial needs of the country, we will invest this kind of year by year. This year, if you have some understanding of the electric billboard, you will probably know that.

That's when you apply for construction permit. 15% of the total amount of capital invested into this. It is to meet such conditions 15%. So you can imagine at that time. We have a capital increase to enter Guoguang. This should happen in the second or third quarter of this year.

That is to see the progress of the entire construction permit application. It is likely that this year there will be such an increase in capital will be more. So we only need to prepare 40 billion 15% first.

There is no 15% of the total investment amount. It is 15% of the total investment amount. It is 15% of the total investment amount. It is about 15% of the total investment amount.

And he said unto them, Behold, we pray thee, if we have done all these things, and have done all these things, and have done all these things, and have done all these things, and have done all these things, and have done all these things, and have done all these things.

Ask the box. deals flies fork head. True. Sound.

ID Creation. That's all there is to it. We thank the President for explaining to us today. We'll let it go.

I wish you all a smooth investment in health. Thank you. Thank you Mita. Thank you for all your advance friends. Thank you again.
