In addition to serving the domestic market, we also export to many countries. For more than 60 years, we have uphold the spirit of artisans, with the most serious attitude, as well as the best quality to serve customers. Although we are a traditional enterprise, but in recent years we have continued to invest in information and intelligent manufacturing, this effect also reflects the effectiveness of our operations, and improve the work of ESG, the United States also fully invested in, and in the stock exchange listed corporate governance evaluation of the third level of recognition, this is not easy for small and medium-sized listed enterprises, we will later have a detailed explanation. The second half of the Fed's base rate between 5% and the second half of the Fed's officials suggested that there would be two cuts, the third part is that the Fed's officials do not think that the economy will have a serious recession, the fourth point is the part of the list, from April the Fed will buy this so-called U.S. bond from the month to April, the Treasury and a portion of the mortgaged securities will fall from the upper limit of 60 billion U.S. bonds to 400 billion U.S. dollars, the third point is the part of the Ukrainian war. In the past year, China has been the world's largest producer and consumer of iron and steel, because of its surplus production, it is low-cost dumping, causing compensation for global trade, because it has just explained that China during the two sessions in March, the so-called eight-recommended commission has made a report to the National People's Congress, mainly to revise several measures, the main way to modify some basic manufacturing industry replacement of iron and steel glass, this measure is mainly to promote some backward inefficiencies in the capacity, so the third point, about President Trump on March 12, his so-called 25% steel and tariffs have been fully implemented, which means that the cost of the global consumption of iron and steel in the United States, other 301 or that, next, I asked Mr. Jiang Yuanqing, the deputy general manager of our operation center for all to do a report. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcriptions and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite, or condensate any of the original text, so it is necessary to keep them sentence-by-word while organizing them into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I will read through the whole transcription to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a presentation about the steel industry market analysis and the company's operation report, divided into several points, each point has detailed data and analysis. Next, I need to identify the natural segmentation point of each paragraph, usually at the beginning of a topic transition or a new topic. For example, in the transcription of the user's transcription, the first part discusses the impact of the U.S. trade policy, then the domestic central bank's credit control, then the development of the stainless steel market, and finally the company's operation profile.

For example, on the part of U.S. trade policy, from "except steel" to "may trigger some trade wars" can form a paragraph. Then, the credit control section of the national central bank from "fourth point" to "short-term not too much impact" as another paragraph. During the processing process, it is necessary to pay attention to the mapping of the timestamp to ensure that each sentence is correctly positioned. At the same time, check whether there are missing or duplicated sentences to ensure that all contents are properly converted. For example, in the user's copywriting, some timestamps may jump, such as [714. 00-717. 00] after jumping to [719. 00-720. 00], this may be due to spaces or sections in the original record, which need to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity between sentences, appropriate use of the connection words or adjust the punctuation symbols to make the paragraphs smoother. For example, it is important to combine this section with the following sentences to form a complete sentence: "This section is worth noting that this represents an upgrade of U.S. tradeism. " When handling the company's operational profile section, it is necessary to segment each business location and revenue analysis to ensure that each sub-part is clear. For example, the Taipei, Taoyuan, and Tainan locations can be combined into a paragraph, while revenue analysis is segmented by year and industry segment.

Make sure that all timestamps and sentence sequences are correct, with no omissions or errors. Challenges that may be encountered include dealing with duplicate or redundant information, for example, when analyzing revenues, the same data may be repeated in different parts and need to be checked to see if it belongs to the same paragraph. In addition, to ensure the accuracy of professional terms and numbers, such as "12.7 billion", "15000 tons", etc., to avoid errors during the conversion process.

In addition to steel, he also spreads to steel and some downstream basic processing products. This part is worth noting that this represents an upgrade to tradeism in the United States, a trade system in the world, and some relationships with allies in the United States, which may result in some damage. More importantly, some potential countermeasures from various countries may trigger some trade wars, which further exacerbates a breakdown of the so-called global economy.

But the public works and the private construction of the factory, the current visibility is relatively low, this part is still the government's policy to guide and manufacturers. Fifth point, the other about the mechanical processing, sports equipment, automobile and motorcycle tubes, the current observation is that the industry and the market demand is relatively conservative.

The second point, has just reported the so-called U.S. 12 March 2025 so-called steel and aluminum tariffs part, this is for stainless steel products, because Taiwan originally was 25%, for the export to the U.S. part, everyone's competitive conditions are the same, compared to help domestic industry export to the U.S... The third point is, domestic stainless steel supply is greater than demand, the industry pattern is difficult to correct. Next is a summary of the operation of a report.

The following is the report of revenue analysis from other industries, the revenue economy, compared to 113 years and 112 years, compared with steel real estate and fishing pipes and investment. The main part of my introduction is that the section of steel is about 5 billion yuan, 112 million yuan, 113 million yuan, compared with 112 years, about 13 billion yuan. I have divided the section of steel into three parts to explain, that is, the section of domestic sales in Taiwan, as well as the export of Taiwan, as well as the section of Vietnam Meja.

The second part is the real estate investment, 113 years is -72, 112 years is 4 billion, the main reason is that there is no new so-called real estate income free relationship. The third part is the hotel service, 113 annual revenue is about 19.8 million, 112 years is 11.7 million, 113 years is about 2 million years. Next is the analysis of the number of steel sales, this is just reported a little relationship, I have to explain the amount of the sales. 112 years is about 122000 tons, 2013 is 102000 tons.

The main part of the sale, my analysis is also just, in three parts, Taiwan's mere domestic sales and Taiwan's mere export, as well as Vietnam's mere sales of mere part. Taiwan mere domestic sales is probably reduced by about 20000 tons, part of mere export is probably reduced by about 155 tons, Vietnam mere part is probably reduced by 74 tons. So the main reduction is mere 20000 tons of mere domestic sales, this part is just explained, about the sale of stainless steel steel rolling is about 15000 tons, that is based on a product, the other part is about 4000 tons of carbon steel steel and stainless steel. Next is about a proportion of sales in Taiwan and overseas sales, although the overall sales of mere sales is reduced, it is only about 1% of the difference between mere and 112 years.

The first part is the part of Vietnam Meiya, the former and later comparison is not very different, about 1%, Vietnam Meiya is mainly the so-called production of the so-called structure tube, the main face of the industry is the motorcycle industry, the sales have just reported, about 1% of the difference. The second part is the part of Thailand Guangtai, the 113 year sales ratio is reduced about 8%, Thailand Guangtai main sales is the first product is the same as the so-called structure tube production, then the straw, then the industry is mainly the car industry, then the reduction of 8% of the sales mainly because of the local car sales in 2024 is only 149 million, compared to the previous year is a drop of about 10%, so the overall use of some parts of the so-called car parts are reduced.

The main reason is because it is aiming for the so-called automotive industry, which in 2024, a car industry in Vietnam has been slowed down a recovery. Then the report is a contribution to an overseas business, the comparison year is 111 years and 113 years, these three years of this recognition of the revenue, the three are probably not very different, overall, these three locations have been combined, each year can recognize an investment interest of about $1.3 billion. The above is my report, thank you all. Next in the ESG work description, we first report the environmental part. The first point is about greenhouse gas, we have completed the second annual inventory of one of ISO14064, and have completed the external inspection of 112 years. Of course, we have carbon reduction, part of greenhouse gas reduction is 4.34.

We are currently working on a 113-year greenhouse gas inventory, which is expected to have a second external inspection in the second half of the year. In addition to energy management, we have done three major tasks recently: the first is the upgrade of the air compressor, this will improve the efficiency of our production, and by the end of the year, we will also have to repair some of our pipelines at the same time to reduce the energy consumption of leakage; the second is the improvement of our main production process, the heating equipment of the core line, this part of which will improve our production efficiency, environmental energy saving, and the third part of which we will also invest in the collection of waste heat, if we start to make a direct profit.

In addition to the above materials, MAYA has comprehensive executive management cadres and online management courses for reserve cadres. In addition, we also have professional institutions such as metal processing centers to carry out our skills training, and we have a reading club to conduct physical exchanges.

In addition, we also contribute to the development of institutional education institutions to help people with disabilities improve their lives. In the corporate governance section, we have published the second edition of our Sustainability Report and are currently working on the development of our third annual Sustainability Report. In terms of corporate governance rankings, we are currently at level 3, and we are continuing to work on this level. In terms of efficiency evaluation, our Board of Directors has been evaluating the effectiveness of our work for 113 years and we have completed it.

We also use the time of this book to explain the issue of shareholders' concern about the 113-year earnings distribution. Our company will hold a board discussion in April and will inform you in the form of an announcement. We encourage you to encourage the development of the 113-year plan, and also ask your shareholders and friends to be informed of our latest progress through our open platform. Next, the balance sheet of assets in our financial position profile is $4.9 billion, our total assets are $2.9 billion, our total current liabilities are $2.9 billion, our total assets are $3.7 billion, and our total equity is $4.6 billion.

This is because our business units have some adjustments to the product structure portfolio, some of the effective use of resources, and the benefits are directly reflected in the performance of the Maori. Our business Maori is 7.9 billion, our business profit is 4.8 billion, our business profit is 4.9 billion, our business profit is 4.9 billion, our business income and expenditure is 497 billion, and the net profit is 8.2 billion in this period. That is, we have a very important problem in this aspect, we look at the important financial related indicators: the gross profit rate of 113 years is 15. 19%, from which we can see that our gross profit margin has been significantly increased in the previous years. Operating profit rate is 9.1%, tax revenue is 15. 78%, return is 10. 91%, return is 19.09, and our net value per share is 17. 16, EPS 3.09.
