The following is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs: Thank you very much for your participation in today's meeting. We are glad to invite you to join us today's meeting. First of all, I would like to introduce you to the President, one is Mr. Xu Jianying. The second is Mr. Chiu, the vice president, and everyone is welcome.

This page should be known after everyone has seen it, the main thing I would like to introduce is that we have set up a Chinese building materials company in 2019, that he is the main product is the so-called ALC, 2021 set up a Guoding project, then this function is responsible for the construction of the project company, that 2024 last year we together with a subsidiary of hi-tech construction technology to invest in this reset brick company. This is mainly a waste recycling technology plant, then use, and then generate concrete, this is the direction of our future carbon reduction, so set up these companies. Well, the next page we have a total of 26 plants, that is his scope, then to introduce this map is our company's main right here, because we have the best collaboration and scheduling capabilities can be coordinated with customers in a very short time, so this is the second season.

That is, there may be these external factors, the third quarter may be like typhoon also affect, the fourth quarter is the best time in the climate, so the performance will be a bit better, then we look at last year's fourth quarter compared to last year's third quarter QOQ, our revenue grew by 6.1%, the amount of growth is about 3.3 billion, the details there are mainly in China increased by 2.5 billion, the Suzhou increased by 0.2 billion, and the shipping company increased by 0.23 billion. Then look at the same thing as Maoli, the growth of about 12.1%, the amount is about 1.5 billion, the main thing is that the domestic budget and territory of the country's own Maoli increased by about 1.57.5 billion.

That said, in the year 2024, in 2023, it was about 6.78 billion than growth, which was mainly the domestic itself increased by 8.900 million, the HP increased by 0.7 billion, the HP increased by 0.4 billion, the Chinese language 0.3 billion, and the Suzhou was about 380 million, so the Suzhou area was a lot less, because the environment in the mainland of 2024 last year was poor, so what is not good for the overall environment. Well, the Maori part compared with the 2023, we increased by about 6 billion, the country's salary also increased by 51.1 billion, the HP increased by 10.41 billion, the Chinese language also increased by 0.5 billion, and the Suzhou decreased by 7.4 billion.

We have three billion people selling this braised stone, which is why we grew up in that area. The land of China is, of course, just what we have said, is a huge drop. The other combined subsidiaries should basically maintain this pace. Then this important financial ratio, in fact, to tell you that our current EBITDA and the three green greens are all going up.

This is the reason why we have been working with this company for more than 16 months. We have been working with people with carbon-tolerant orders for more than a year, so basically, we have been working with the company for more than a year, so basically, we are talking about the quality of the company is not a problem. The main reason why we are doing this is because we have left the environmental factors that affect our company's performance, maybe the government policy, or the lack of work, or the reasons for the weather, which will affect our operation.

So basically because we have more than a year of people, so this year's outlook is to maintain steady growth, as long as the weather is good, or there are no other black swan events, we are very optimistic that this year should still be good. The next point is that we have 16 low carbon carbon concrete, 8 of which are more carbon labels from the Ministry of the Environment, so we should know that we are in the future development of Nangang headquarters, so this is the future we will be expected to complete 2027 years, but because after the completion of the completion of some licensing, etc., it may be possible to let Chen rent a lease or decorate this kind of thing. The second point is that we are constantly developing these low carbon, or AI systems, and then let us be more competitive in this industry.

This is just a reminder that you are like us, and that you are near enough to support your blending at any time. This is also a reminder of how long it will take for your concrete to arrive in about an hour, so look at our drawing, it's about 30 minutes away and our plants can support each other. That's my report here, and we can go into this 2NA. Finally, I'm going to report to you that we've got these awards, companies like Dragon's Business Weekly's Carbon Power 100, and that we've got a certificate of success from CommonWealth Magazine.

Thank you for sharing. TSMC's share of electricity last year, about 11%, then the current order is about 5%. Amount, there seems to be a problem in the inside, there seems to be a problem, and there is no way to know if the boss can open it. In the case of manual orders, there is a cold visibility of the order, the proportion of various engineering categories, can not tell us.

This is the proportion of the public works category, this detailed data we have, because it is only 70% of what we say, contains three and a half buildings, but you say, you can only tell us how much it is, how much it is, we can not talk too much.

Thank you, Vice President.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim, paying attention to the timestamps and the corresponding sentences. In the example given by the user, some sentences are repeated, such as "can we share the price of each quarter last year?" Three times. I need to make sure that these duplicate sentences are kept during finishing without any deletions or mergers. Next, I need to sort these verbatim contents into paragraphs in logical order.

At the same time, discussions about revenue targets and shipments for 2025 also need to be made separately. It is important to note that some sentences may have overlaps or intervals in timestamps, but the user requests not to delete anything, so all timestamps and corresponding sentences must be kept. In addition, some sentences may have small errors in timestamps, such as there are gaps in the middle (such as missing timestamps between 1513. 06-1527. 90), but the user does not point out the problem, so keep them as they are.

In addition, the "Development Progress of the Southern Headquarters" section referred to by the user needs to separate the progress of Building A and Building B to maintain the order and repeat of the original. Similarly, the instructions on the rate of interest and search cases also need to be maintained in the same way, without any modification. Finally, the thank-you and subsequent contact information of the meeting end section also need to be fully preserved to ensure that all contents are correctly classified into the corresponding paragraphs. After finishing, I will read the entire paragraph-based verbatim text again, confirm that there are no missing sentences, and logical coherence, in line with the user's requirements.

Want to ask a question about the part of the clay. Can you please tell us the price of the clay in each quarter last year? What is the price of the first quarter of the year and the year? Can you share it with us?

The price of clay last year. Can you share it with us? The price of clay every quarter last year. The price of the first quarter is speaking. Speaking of the first quarter, it's almost 3000.

The second season is about 3126. The third season is about 3186. The fourth season is about 3175. The price is about 3180. The second season is about 3100.

The second quarter is about 3100. The third quarter is about 3100. The third quarter is about 3100. The third quarter is about 3100. The third quarter is about 3100.

That is affected by the slowdown in domestic housing demand. That is also the impact. That is the fourth quarter vs. the first quarter of this year's average ASP. That is the fourth quarter vs. the first quarter of this year's average ASP.

Because we're currently. Because we're currently. Because we're looking at the price of the order. The current price is still in high-end condition. There's no obvious feeling of the trend below the price.

Increase in carbon costs. The cost of harvesting, etc. will rise. Basically the price will fall as well. So the company's view is still that the price is the problem. The main thing is depends on the amount. The main thing depends on the amount.

So my company's opinion is that the price is a problem. So my company's opinion is still that the price is a problem. Is there a plan for disposal of land today? Is there a plan for disposal of land today? There are no plans for disposal of land at this time.

Say, say, plan. Of course, sometimes there is no plan that suddenly a buyer says I want to buy. Then I feel that the price is good to be able to close immediately. This is not a good thing. But let's assume that there is really something we feel like.

We also have to pay for it. The development progress of the South headquarters is because we have a division of A and B building. The current progress of building A is followed. The current progress of building A is followed.

Building B may be over 40%. Now building B may be over 40%. Now building B may be over 40%. Now building B may be over 40%. Just said 2025's revenue target. Just said 2025's revenue target. Would you like to ask about the target of 2025's shipping?

The goal of shipping in 2025 is to keep track of revenue. For us, last year we were 582 million squares. This year we talked about six million jumps. We hope to be even higher.

Basically, it is six million. Our goal is six million jumps. Our goal is six million jumps. Our goal is 62 million jumps. Our goal is 62 million jumps. Our goal is 62 million jumps.

Our goal is to jump up to 621,000. OK There are two new questions here to ask. The interest rate for the future should be our company as well.

We have always been. I suggest that this strategy is going to be around 70%. That is to say, yesterday's latest progress in the search. Basically we also checked it out. Because yesterday we didn't come to search for our company. So we basically don't know what the case is.

Now how. And we all know what the press says. So it is not easy for us to say. We only say that we cooperate with the investigation. It is clear that the press is better than us.

And our Lord said, "Let there be light, and let there be light, and let there be light, and let there be light, and let there be light, and let there be light."

And he said unto him, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's iniquity is a reproach unto him; and his sin is a reproach unto him.

Last year was 580. We should have 600 that year. Generally speaking, the second half of the year will be better than the first half of the year.

It's a good time to do this. It's a good time to get together. It's a good time to start this year. It's a good time to start all over again.

That's because there's a seventh wave to beat this year because of the lack of jobs. So this year started work. The number of days later. So February's revenue will be better than last year. But N1N will be less. Because the number of days is less.

Because it is our nature. We usually only start after midnight. This year, it is a few days longer. Because of the lack of work, the industry in February needs to be less than January. But it will grow more than the same period last year.

So you don't have to be afraid of February. That's normal. Because we're going to start working after midnight. It's later this year. Because we can't find workers.

So February's business needs to be less than January. Please don't be afraid. It looks like normal data. It will be normal after March. The second half will be better than the first half of the year.

This is the first time that we have been blessed by God, and we have been blessed by God.

We do not know what to do with it, but we do not know what to do with it, and we do not know what to do with it, and we do not know what to do with it, and we do not know what to do with it.

You can contact us through the first gold or the company's IR window. We wish you all good health here.

** Paragraph type transcript**. Please also continue to pay attention to the domestic building materials that support the stock code 2504. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your help. Thank you.
