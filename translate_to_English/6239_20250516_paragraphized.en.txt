Mirrors and Dots. Mirrors and Dots. Mirrors and Dots. Mirrors and Dots. Mirrors and Dots. Mirrors and Dots. Can see my first quarter revenue up to 154.94 billion.

183 billion compared to the same quarter last year. There are about 2.8 billion parts reduced. On the right-hand side of the screen. We especially put it if it was in the first quarter of last year. If not in the case of Xi'an, make a breakdown.

Because we were in the first half of 2024 last year. There is also a forecast of revenue in Xi'an. In the future part. Starting from the second half of last year. There is no Xi'an. So we are in the first quarter and the second quarter of the report.

We will make this number breakdown. Let's make it more clear about one of our situations. If so, in the case of a normal profit and loss settlement. This is the first quarter of the year, 154.94 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, 183 billion.

This decreases 2.8 billion miles. Mainly the part of NEMFRECH. The part of NEMFRECH decreases roughly. It decreases nearly 1.4 billion.

Nearly 1.4 billion. Second is the part of the DRAM. The DRAM part is reduced by about 1.1 billion. The DRAM part is reduced by 1.1 billion. That is the part of the SSD.

So these three parts gave me a revenue of the whole. Less than the same period last year. The DRAM part is actually more accurate to the part. It is the influence of Xi'an. So let's look at the part of Xi'an.

If I deduct the revenue from the first quarter of Xi'an, there is about 1.6 billion. So the revenue from the first quarter will reach 1.6 billion. So the gross profit margin of the first quarter is 17. 1. 5.

The cost of doing business has also been reduced in part. Mainly because the profit from the performance does not reach a standard of bonuses. So the cost of doing business here will be relatively less than one.

In addition to the PTA, many companies in the second quarter, it is still maintaining a relatively high cost, so it is likely that like us, our sales cost is still maintaining about 32 parts of such, so my income is already 30 parts of the settlement cost, but my costs may be used 32 parts, so these two parts will reduce the income and cost, so this part of the two parts will be my gross profit rate in the second quarter. In fact, we will have a significant impact on the exchange here, in order to deliver, we have to calculate the value of each dollar, such as from 33 to 32 or 32 such a change, and we will have a total profit margin of 1. If the second quarter is less than the second quarter of the second quarter. This part is not only PTI, I believe that the so-called electronic brother or foreign export answer is more, this effect will certainly have an impact in addition to the interest rate of the revenue I just talked about, and then there is the cost to bring to the previous high cost part, exchange rate, and when I evaluate, I have an example in the morning, that is, to the manufacturer, like we may forex, I may go out, I may collect a piece of 100 dollars, but I may purchase some raw materials, collector equipment, I may spend 60 dollars, my net exposure part is 40, net 40, net 40 pieces, that is what I call the exposure part.

The more the exposure area you stay, the more the exchange rate life will affect you, the greater the trend in Taiwan Dollar, we can now respond to the part, we try to reduce the net exposure, the reduction of the net exposure, of course, I will not be able to earn the benefits of exchange, but the relative exchange benefit of this piece will be less, so in the whole of my exchange interest will be less, so the exchange interest of the exchange interest will be more advanced, you look at the report, I would suggest that from these three points of view, one is a decrease in revenue, there is a change in his cost, there is a change in his net part, these three places will affect the cost, and the so-called exchange benefit of the number. In the third quarter, the number of customers to our Forecast is also not good, or is higher than the number of the second quarter, but there will be a variable here, that is, because the current to the third quarter 789 here, there may be variables, maybe with time delay, he may be to the end of May or June or early June, tell you that I am slowly modifying this number, this is possible, but so far, we see the third quarter numbers, the actual financial concept will be more conservative, we will think that this is basically not converted to PO.

I don't think that's just a train or a Forecast reference. It's better to see the situation than the number of the Q3. But I think this part, of course, we hope he's happy as expected. If we happen to happen to happen to happen to happen to happen, my Q4Q revenue will continue to go up. Just say that there is a possible variable here, because the client is still a Forecast, and he has room to adjust.

Q4: I don't have a guideline to report Q4, but I don't have a guideline to report that Q4 will continue to go up or down. The number of the current reference is still better than Q3, but I think you will not listen to PTI's one explanation, I think you can refer to it, it is really up to the second half of the year, I think the variable is still relatively large. So for the whole year, I think of the revenue of the year, I think the revenue of the last year is 73 billion, in terms of the current team is expected to report with me, and with you all the previous investment report, we last year there are nearly 33 billion Xi'an, so if you take the number of Xi'an, 7 billion, it should be a point to start this year.

D-RAN is one of the most popular ways to invest in D-RAN. D-RAN is actually one of our main customers, and MIRON is one of those customers. In the media, he has always mentioned that he is going to fill all of his HBN here. We have also told you before that he is doing HBN here, and that he will probably be squeezed into his traditional mobile or graphic production capacity. Based on the time we work with Micron, there is also a cost advantage, Micron is naturally an order in this regard, slowly release to PTI.

So, I would like to say that in the last two days, I think that in a conversation with JP Morgan, Micron also said that at present, they forecast to the second quarter and the third quarter, whether it is the D-RAN or the NAND part, in fact, there is a little bit of a good news. So we also think that this is why we can just be more optimistic with you, the number of the second quarter should be only OK, because growth is better than the first quarter, because this is already a PO number, as long as production is no problem HAPPEN.

This is part of the reason for the decline in revenue, because the share of revenue if the share of revenue is relatively small, this figure will continue to increase. So in the first quarter of this year, we talk about the logic of the fourth quarter of this year, continue to increase. In addition to the PTI is also part of the process, there is of course the part of the ultrasonic part, which is part of our business in Japan TPJ and Taiwan TPW. The business part I talk about first, we still go back to the part of our balance sheet.

This part of the show shows that the entire financial structure for the PTI is OK. Our guideline at the beginning of the year is probably 151, and so far we still have not changed. It may be more careful investors, this two-day investor, he shared with me an experience, he said, from January 1, this year to the last part of the announcement, in fact, our capital expenditure is probably 54 billion.

That's part of the equipment included in the 3.4 billion, and the factory we bought, about 7 billion, and the board of directors last week by going to invest in a green energy part, about 1 billion. So in terms of the KPX part, I would like to tell you that this kind of KPX part, the burden on the PTI 1.5 billion, financial structure will not be a big financial burden.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided copying fragments, sorting them into paragraph copying. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. User emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will check the textual copy provided by the user in a few steps, pay attention to the timestamp and content.

I will then consider how to segment. Usually, paragraph verbatim texts will be segmented based on topic or speaker's ideas. For example, the amount of capital generated by the money and the expenses of the TPW may belong to the same paragraph, and subsequent questions and responses about investment scrutiny can be used as another paragraph.

However, it is necessary to confirm that the user has a special request, but according to the current instructions, the user does not mention the retention timestamp, so you can ignore it. In addition, check whether there are duplicate or redundant content. For example, "Then the TPW here also spent" three times, it may be necessary to keep the original, but may be that the user wants to merge, but according to the rules can not be rewritten, so it must be retained three times.

For example, questions and responses about investment scrutiny should be put together in the same paragraph to ensure that the context is clear. At the same time, pay attention to the correct use of professional terms, such as "CP", "FT", "KPEX", etc., to ensure that they do not change their meaning during finishing. Finally, after finishing the finishing, it is necessary to read through, make sure that there are no missing sentences, all the contents are correctly categorized and in line with the user's requirements. Check for formatting errors, such as punctuation, paragraph separation, etc., to ensure that the final paragraph typed texts are both in line with the user's requirements and are easy to read.

So until now, because of his business relationship with the same client, he has spent nearly 10 billion parts, nearly 10 billion parts. Then, the TPW here also spent money, and then the TPW here also wasted, and then the TPW here also spent nearly fifty billion parts. So, just to test the part of the industry, because I spent billions of dollars, I may have bought a dozen units. So we understand that in the morning, the investment monitor asked me, do you buy these platforms, is the customer's order stable, or is it not this sustainability? So I said, I also reported to the investment monitor this morning, because it was wrong, when we were doing capital decision-making, you would also take into account that I might buy twenty dollars, and that I bought twenty dollars, and that I might have bought twenty dollars.

We believe that this KPEX is too big for me, is not the customer can also carry it to us? So the whole said we spent the whole time, sky buy this base, in fact, should be more than the actual arrival, this KPEX base to come to more. So basically, for the guest he provided here, I thought, it should be that the guest is willing to carry us, on behalf of him there is a certain commitment to the order. So if we buy these bases, these bases also take into account that if we buy this part of the customer, what is the timing of the order?

Well, so this investment advanced view, we report to him that when we make this decision, there is a change in this place, so if we say that this customer order, persistent problem, in addition to this loading, there is a share, we also take into account this. So in terms of the growth of TPW this logic, we think that the current gold caused monthly revenue, now about 4 to 5 billion parts, we think that by the end of the end of the year, should continue to increase to close to 600 million, or even more than 600 million, so the gold caused with the TPW, the two companies strictly speaking, mainly the CP and FT. In the past caused the CP and the FT part, about 64 more, the test slightly.

I think we can all do this kind of report, so far, I don't know how much you need to know about the TPW here? Well, if I don't then I'll follow you down the report, in addition to the TPW this side of a change, a part of our outlook on the superwind here, probably what? You can see, in our meeting, we talked about the outlook of the next second season, so that the whole world continues to pay attention, the impact of U.S. tariffs, and exchange rates, I think this place is also the part of the constant attention.

So here we may talk again, and then Samsung this piece, we really have little interaction with Samsung here, just to talk about some of the cooperation, but there is no political engagement. Here we see, we have a customer called Solida part, Solida later by SK Hailis, so it is now called SK Hailis part, even if SK Hailis part, it becomes a Korean operator, but its SSD part, is still in the PTI side of the production, especially Enterprise part.

**HBN and Panel Level Fan Out progress**. Need to also slowly also mention this part of the case HBN3 or 3E in cooperation and development. At present, because HBN has a relatively large problem, is earlier we also told us that you do not buy, because you do not have a micro-powder this situation, although you have the equipment slow ready, but you do not have a micro-powder you can not do, you have no way to prove that my grain and green is OK, my cost structure should be done with you, basically competitive. In the past we did not have such a real number or experience to talk to these guests.

As far as I know, in fact, we have started to make progress from the end of the second quarter, so we expect that in the next two or three Q, with the micro-powder we get, and then some sample, some samples, is to give these customers a reference, when we do verification, I believe that in the future we will fight for the cost of HBN's electronic money, I believe that the cost of the future we will be able to win HBN's electronic money in the future, and I believe that the cost of the future will be helpful for us to fight HBN's electronic money. This is the part of HBN, in fact, to talk about the more concerned part of the process is the panel level fan out, here is a progress to talk about, we should be in 2014, 2018, from the point of sale back to the 1718 time, in fact, we have a factory, specifically for the panel level fan out, at the time the truth is, because you only do the panel size part, a lot of material or equipment, so the vendor is to do the project separately to do, so the equipment or material is not really as fast as now, not as fast as fast, we are to do the panel level, mainly for Taiwan's flagship mobile phone is here, here I want to do this kind of product as the main, we want to be able to be consistent with the integration stage, we want to talk about whether we have to do the same thing in the future, whether we have a discussion with the next time with the customer, whether there is also in the technical support, whether there is also in the technical support, we have a technical support, whether we have a better, whether we have a technical support, whether there is a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, whether we have a technical support, whether we have a technical support, we have a technical support, whether we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, whether we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, whether we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, we have a technical support, technical support, we have a technical support, technical support, technical support, we have a technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support, technical support It was expected that his volume should be in the first Q, the first Q actually slowly can grow up, now this part because of the mineral problem, so there are some delays, so now this guest, he does PTI monthly revenue, or close to the NT$100 million such a scale, there is a relatively slow, we also think that may be in the second quarter after, in fact, there is a slow chance. ***** *****

Slowly there is a chance to continue to increase. But all year round, we think it is a part of single digital. Because PTI is either 700 billion or 733 numbers. One percent is about 700 billion.

So, we think. This part of the power module is about that. Except for a customer's revenue contribution. We also currently have a second guest with a third guest at Engage.

The second guest should be at the end of the second quarter. Even the third guest should be in the third quarter. The third guest should be in the third quarter. Or the fourth part should be in the second quarter.

So this is part of the power module. Overall, we think it's about an entire year. It's a single digital part. So the above is for everyone more concerned about HBN. Or the Panel level or the power module part.

I don't know if you have any advanced investment. I need to explain more about this. If we don't go down there, we'll go down there again. Logically speaking, we've just introduced the part of the ultra-wind.

It's an AI-related product. The customer's demand for it. Fleet chip's production capacity is also good. It's also good. So it's a logical part of the overwind here.

The super wind here is due to the continuous attention of the guests. Therefore, it is also expected to come up slowly. The amount of money seen on the screen is caused by the side of TPJ. If you just followed the report, it will be the part of the KPX this year until mid-May. It has spent 2 billion parts.

There is also a part of the passenger transport. So we think that with a delivery of the platform, it should be the growth of revenue in the second half of the year. There is a chance of slowing up.

And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, This is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me: this do in remembrance of me.

These guys have come to be. There are at least ten to twenty. A continental design company. Slowly there are in the approach PTR. Fast. There may be some parts that have already been tried.

It is quite slow. It is most likely that everyone is in the tab DOA. Then it is to discuss specifications. There are even some parts of our production line to look at. So this whole part.

In the second quarter, we thought it was a figure of revenue for the second quarter. Because part of the white-list revenue should be small. It shouldn't be small. It might be more likely that the amount of potential appears. It should be in the third quarter.

Because PTR used to be the case, we have a general election in the mainland area. There are only two production locations. One is Xi'an Meiguang. Xi'an Meiguang in Xi'an is the factory of the Fumeiguang. So the factory is not connected to the other manufacturers of the mainland.

Production customers. That was part of my experience in Suzhou. When PTR was involved in Suzhou, China. It was hoped that this plant would be directed to some operators in mainland China. After receiving their orders, the PTR involved for about 10 years.

This plant is actually a small gain or a small loss. It is recently at the edge of the poverty, so because the Chinese people also know well. The Chinese government for semiconductors, especially in the latter part of the country, is a great help.

In particular, it is quite large. So in this case, it is often the case that the previous history of Suzhou to go to China with the operators to collect orders. It is true that this part of the price is very good. It is not easy to get the part of the order. It is not easy to get the order.

Because of the structure of your costs, and the fact that you have received subsidies from the government versus the mainland operators. In fact, it is quite inconsistent on the basis of fact. That is, with the white list part of the talk, I talked to investment advanced reports in the morning. These mainland operators come to Taiwan.

In fact, there is another problem facing the price problem. What does it mean? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That's because the OSR may be able to get quite a subsidy from the Chinese government. So it's possible that the OSR will only take 1 to 2 pieces from these mainland operators. But today he's going to go to some of these white-listed OSR operators to see. If it's reasonable to cost 4 to 5 pieces, it's impossible for me to take 1 to 2 pieces from you.

Even my so-called variable cost. Even my variable cost does not come back. The variable cost is a few major parts. I may even have materials or my workers' wages. This is the case when this cover does not come back. Even if I have a display capacity.

Basically, I don't get too close to such an order. Because I don't have enough money to cover the money I buy materials at variable costs. I'm not able to cover some of the fixed depreciation I call. Or some of the expenses associated with some people. So in this case, he used to be used to one or two pieces of processing costs to rise to 10 pieces of 5 pieces.

Basically, this is for mainland Chinese companies. I really believe they will take more consideration. So, let's just say that in the present case, mainland Chinese companies want to turn out the part. In fact, there will be a problem facing the rise in processing costs. The part I just talked about is how progress is.

As an example, we sell to a mainland Chinese company called Jiang Polong. He used to be a business owner. He used to know more about PTA in the past, just like we rented the factory to them. We sold 70% of the equity to them.

The two of us are more of a partnership, so he runs faster. So here we have a few small batches. He wants to be part of the US market. In fact, we will use this to make a later part of the production.

He belongs to a faster businessman. The rest is just talking. Because it may not be familiar. So I may also come from this so-called KYC. I always want to know what kind of property this guest is. He will not interfere with some of his regulations in the United States.

The shareholders behind him or the guests behind him are not. This U.S. government is going to. There are more considerations, such as Huawei's part.

Here is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. If this is a relationship, I'd rather consider saying that I don't have to do it. So I'm going to talk about whitelisting. We'll start by filtering out one of our clients, and then, in fact, his products belong to the Taiwan government or the US government, where they take into account a substance list of high-tech or strategic control.

So I'd like to point out the effect of whitelisting. PDI believes that the second quarter of revenue should be limited. But this part we're going to try to predict at the end of July, so we'll try to report to you how we're going to increase revenue in this regard because of the whitelisting relationship. I think there should be a clear number to explain to you at that time.

So if we don't talk directly about what we want to say? In fact, I think we're talking about the Q1 number in April, and we're talking about why the Q1 number should be what we want to be this year's bottom. So in the second quarter, we also see that the number of customers in the second quarter is a relatively clear part.

In particular, some of our projects should have the opportunity to grow in the first quarter. Especially if we look at AI-related issues. Advanced packages are some of the most advanced packaging testing technologies. Whether they are HBM or Panel Fanout or PowerMind. In fact, some of the results can be seen slowly and gradually.

In the future, of course, we would also like to remind you that there is a U.S. tariff. In the end, this will not be a shrinking part of consumer spending. If consumption is shrinking, I do believe that this is not just a part of the industry that semiconductors may be related to, but many industries will be affected by different degrees. So we will continue to pay attention to consumer behavior or whether this part is conservative.

The cost of settlement in the second quarter is likely to be higher than last year's and this year's Q1. The cost of settlement in the second quarter is likely to be higher than the relative exchange rate in the previous year and this year's Q1. The cost of settlement in the second quarter is likely to be higher than the relative exchange rate in the previous year and this year's Q1.

I think this should be in the second quarter of the export industry as our Lord, or some export-oriented export-oriented I think the impact of this here should probably be that you should see this change in the investment advanced. So I don't know if you don't know if you have the investment advanced to the point where I need to supplement with you here or if you need to ask me again.

I think I should say that this is a quote from the media. Good news is that one of the operators mentioned in the media is that one of the CPUs in the United States is that if I follow up with you, it should be good. Because this is the industry that the media is talking about CPUs in the United States, there are probably only two of them. Because the CPU part may be that you know that the level of the CPU is much more complex.

So what type of CPU do you think you can do with your application? I think you might think this part is interesting. I don't want to answer that? In fact, another advanced investment should be that part of the NAM and SSC can not grow this year. Because this part of the NAM to talk about the main guest of our NAM is actually the Kiroshio part of the Kiroshio part I mentioned earlier in the morning that if I remember correctly, it should be expected that he should be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the whole part of the delay until November and December.

However, in the first quarter, the contraction of the fourth quarter continues. So you can also see that the NAM part, if the only part of the NAM reported, has actually decreased by 7 to 900 million, respectively. From the second quarter of the current quarter and the third quarter, the numbers seen are actually growing, and I can clearly say that the second quarter is growing because I think it is already a PO number. The third quarter I see the numbers I think that the 4K part of the 4K is actually growing.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the verbatim texts provided by the user and convert them from a verbatim format to a paragraph. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original word cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original intention and structure must be kept intact.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the general structure and topic of the content. It looks like this section involves financial forecasting, exchange rate impact, quarterly performance analysis, and discussion of production capacity. Next, I need to identify the timestamps of each sentence and group them according to the logical relationship to form a consistent paragraph.

In addition, it is very important that the user mentions "not to delete any sentence", so even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant, it must be retained. For example, a discussion about Q4 variables may have multiple sentences that need to be included. When dealing with financial terms and professional content, it is important to maintain accuracy and avoid changing the original intention due to combining sentences. For example, a discussion about "PTI" and "PTA" needs to be segmented correctly to ensure that the reader understands the context. Finally, check whether the converted paragraphs are smooth, conform to the Chinese reading habits, while ensuring that all timestamps and contents are correct.

So I think the QNAM part of the NAM part is actually better than the quarter, but here with the first-level impact of tariffs on this side, it will not be a temporary change, I think it is really bad to say. So this place can only be more conservative, more flat talk, the second quarter and the second quarter will be better than the first quarter, this is clear, the third quarter looks better than the second quarter, should be expected, Q4 should be better, but there will be no change here, I think Q3 changes, but I think Q4 is really bigger, because I can only say that even if they say, even if they say, the second half of the fourth quarter, it's really too early. So I think that it's better than the QD part, I think we'll be a bit better than the QD.

We will not because of the increase in exchange rates, to tell the truth so far, from the first quarter of our evaluation rate, about 33 pieces of nearly 32 pieces, April exchange or still maintain in 32 pieces, but you can see in these days, almost already on the edge of 30 pieces, may be a bit better than 30. 1. 2 good, but a little bit may be 30. 4 or 5, you see, like today, you can be in the economy or official to talk about some exchange problems, so we think here, an increase in exchange rate and exchange, is there a chance to offset each other?

So I'm just saying that if the customer needs a lot of parts, in fact, we can expect a lot of them. As far as we are talking about comparison, the part that has been integrated, here is probably a small amount from the volume of the sample, maybe a few hundred pieces of the case. So this part of the mass production, we'll see whether you're called a small amount or a large amount of such a change. So we'll just say that to FINOUT here, our mass production of the mobile phone is really a relatively stable part, because it's always doing it.
