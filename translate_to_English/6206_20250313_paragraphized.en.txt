You are welcome to sign up. Your recommendation. The Organizing Committee of the Association is scheduled. We are honored to be invited to this meeting. Director of the Government, and General Manager of Cannon.

Let's take a look at the latest developments with the new company. The meeting is expected to take an hour. Presentations are on the front end. After the presentation time is over. We will leave you with a QA. Then I will hand over the time to the Director.

Thank you, everyone. I'm a non-Jewish technologist. I'm so glad you're here today. Join us. The first non-Jewish corporate committee in 2025.

This is the military of the meeting. We will first meet. Review of last year's one of the figures of last year's financial statement. Then we will be from Maori.

Then we'll talk about it. We'll have a look at this milestone. Then we'll leave time for some Q&A questions.

Well, that's what we're going to look at first, the last full quarter, last year, the 24th quarter.

That's the current season. It's about four years old. And the part is 5.6 billion. It's also the pre-fall. There's a 2 percent increase. Then we'll talk about it.

Let's look at the tax before this. The part created before the tax. Up to 3,600 million. We see the previous level. There is a relative growth of 6 percent. In addition to this revenue growth.

One of the reasons is that the third quarter is at the end of the season. You can go far against the coin. Drops to a multiple segment of 1.3 billion.

That is, until the end of the year. This user is called 3.600 million. So this will be selected in advance of the tax. This is done. This is the fourth quarter of the tax period.

There is one to grow. So look at it throughout the fourth quarter. Ah. EPS is about 6.8. That is more than that. This has been growing for over 60 years.

"We are going to have to do two things [to win]," he said, "and we are going to do two things, and we are going to do two things," he said, "and we are going to do two things."

Yes. You can see that growth is not original. So this revenue is different from the capacity of the shipment. This is also shown in relation to the control of the business. Exceeding control. So the whole shipment capacity control method.

Whether it is from business, that is, this. Cash rate. Or the company's rate. There is a significant increase in the EPS throughout the year.

Yes to 6. 93. This part. It is the company society of both parties. This. We will also help each person's cash rate. This part must be at 26%.

Then we will see a company. Small and medium-sized companies this standard. This is what this trend shows. Here you can see the above one.

The trend of peace convergence. This technology is in the future. The period behind is probably from 2.3 to 3 years. Ours. The whole is one. The production of a rebounding situation.

So far, in fact, it has been established in the military ministry, that is, in this wave, this wave is also a rebound, but we found that the first moment in the first moment we entered the situation of O2 Overput.

Plus. Between March 22 and July. This reservoir is for a meticulous companion. Let him have this very powerful. Live with the new forest. One that produces.

And he said unto them, Behold, the third day is at hand, and the third day is at hand, and the third day is at hand, and the third day is at hand.

It is on the one hand, you can see that in Maori performance, it is a situation to be counted. In the fourth grade of 20 years, about this period of 33-34 years.

This year there was one of them. Slow down to a little trend. We also remember that last year was a mammoth in order to stand on the market. That was the year it was a big city market cap. So you can see.

Even if last year we had finished 13.5%, it was actually down to 20 points. In fact, we still have a gap. But in this part of the gross profit, in fact, 523 for 20. It has been five years to move.

"This is the first time I've seen you," he said, "and this is the third time I've seen you, and I've seen you, and I've seen you, and I've seen you, and I've seen you, and I've seen you every year.

So you can see that this hour on the right is a big jump. That's the whole situation of the previous year. There is a user is a product of the United States. In fact, it is the largest factor in this department store.

That was the last year. In fact, the market power was the strongest. So you can see. It was down 48% of the year before the Canadian infection. It also gave birth to one of the four seasons last year. One was rising.

This is the part of the world that has been performing in the last year. In fact, growth is just a good thing. Of course, it is a good thing to invest in this whole world.

And you're that 38%. That's part of Asia. It's like there's one. It's also a bit of a recession last year. So you can see.

That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

We are in the middle of the conversation, now drawing GM, using the same thing as the potatoes, this is even helpful to the work, come through this.

The timing is a step further up, and it will affect it again.

In the past, we just went to the previous page before he mentioned that this was the last night, actually the second thing, to do something, I wanted to develop in the company's big direction, this run in, this is the same thing, the big direction, that is, through our subsidiaries, our future efforts, and that is the opposite of this strategy, we will also go slowly, outside your identity, to explore the field of this integrated technology, whether it is in the network or AI technology, it helps the integrated industry to solve the various business, they may have, good this, this is the goal of this facility, to solve their problems, or say what to do, go online.

First of all I would like to thank all the comrades for their hard work to participate, now I am still intoxicated, first of all, the United States actually has the various countries will have this practice, but some of them may have disappeared, but just now you can see that this is the part of the relatively news, in Taiwan, the relatively high aspects, but Taiwan's education system rules, such as the so-called Taiwan, even said one more time into the United States, this is based on the practice, want some focus on the production, such as the so-called Taiwan, the so-called, the less targeted system, some practical practice, to IVCM, the introduction of the virus is so much, but we still have some suggestions, if we are now, to do some asy, if we are, to enter the United States, now, and now, to be the general physiological system, the kind of mass production, we are also, and so that we are down, so we do not have no such planning, but we do not have no such, but we will not have no such, but we continue to do, but we will continue to do, we will continue to do this, we will continue to make this, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are all, we are to do, we are to do, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to the next, we are to do, we are to make this, we are to make this, we are to the next, we are to make, we are to make, we are all, we are to make, we are to make, we are to make, we are to make, we are to do, we are to make, Well, now I'd like to ask, the number of receptions of our company is 20 or 20, and then we have 10, then I would like to ask is that our company's reception, is more than, because more, less information, so we want to see, there is no reason, there is no, there is no reason, this is the first question, then I would ask, finance, the company is probably 10 to 40, or this time has stopped, well, that I answered first, he, now, you are at the present, there are 10 receptions, receptions, receptions, receptions, receptions, one, receptions, has always been one, behind the reception, receptions, began to mass production, in fact, it is equivalent, more than, that this year, we will be a lot of customer support, we want to provide, the most of the future, the future of the customer, the future, we will not only, we will provide, the product, the new product, the customer, the most, the future, the future, the next, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the product, the customer, the customer, the future, the future, the next, the future, the next, the product, the market, the market, the market, the market, the market, the market, the only, we will only, the market, the market, we will, the, the, the, the, the market, we will only, the only, the, the, the, the, the, the, the future, we will, the market, the future, the new, the future, the market, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the future, the new, the new, the market, the market, the market, the only, we will, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the future, the future, the future, the only only, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the future, the future, the future, the, the, the future, the future, the, the future, the

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, sorting them into paragraph transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription content provided.

First of all, I will sort all sentences in chronological order. For example, [955. 52-958. 92], followed by [958. 92-962. 04], and so on. It is important to note that there is an interval between timestamps, such as a sudden jump to [1089. 32-1068.] after [1066. 20], there may be missing parts in the middle, but the user requests not to be deleted, so all sentences must be kept, even if there is a jump in the middle.

In addition, some sentences may involve different languages, such as Korean or Chinese mixed, and need to be kept as it is. During the processing process, it is also necessary to check whether there are duplicates or redundant content, but the user explicitly requests not to be deleted, so even if there are duplicates, all must be retained.

In summary, the steps are: 1. Sort all sentences by timestamp; 2. Keep the original sentences in chronological order; 3. Sub-process them to form paragraph-based structures; 4. Check the integrity and accuracy. Ensure that the user's requirements are fully met, do not delete, do not rewrite any content. </think> The following is a paragraph-based transcription in order of the original transcription timestamp (completely retain all content, do not delete, rewrite or condensate any sentence): The second problem is the system solves the world. The system is not only in Taiwan, but also in Australia, in the world, the common service method.

The system solver has become a current situation, in two ways, the first copying part, and the fact that such a program is only presented in a different way, may be a balance to change, or even a CPA, or even a design, let us reveal the program. The software part, because the system solver, it will produce some so-called leakage brush, or the possibility of a countdown, or it may be new, all of these will cause some changes. So we have the purpose of setting up Metro last year, is to hope that from the perspective of customer sports, to complete the program, rather than just call the rice, to put in this answer.

If you are looking for a new product or service that is suitable for you, you may want to purchase a new product or service that is suitable for you. If you are looking for a new product or service that is not suitable for you, you may want to purchase a new product or service that is suitable for you. However, if you are looking for a new product or service that is not suitable for you, you may not be able to purchase a new product or service that is suitable for you. However, if you are looking for a new product or service that is not suitable for you, you may want to purchase a new product or service that is not suitable for you.

We are a growth, but the place is also full of new, and the economic development in the relationship has many people use long-term protective temperament, but a more important strategy is that when not all European customers are all going to go up, but only a few customers in the world.

Some of the U.S. products have a relatively long life span, and the market itself is not small, so customers are often on the market here in the U.S. There are many customers seem very optimistic, so in the project book, many of the actual sales in the past 24 years, there are new or increased numbers here relatively much health.

So it can be simple to say that customers spend an entire year with us to digest some unnecessary or excess inventory. After this lesson, we actually have a very small amount of time with our customers and bids. So it looks like the current situation and the customer's connection is a little healthier, especially in recent years the strength of the Q4 value demand will also make us more robust.

So it is in the U.S. market that we already have some market recognition and recognition that we all know that actually the largest U.S. market chain actually has a large proportion of the U.S. digital chain of agriculture. Beijing's millisecond is a private store where its machine model varies depending on the individual. The addition of milliseconds to the contract is to pay not only equipment, but also to buy other software, electronic or equipment they can decide to protect the time. But now the cooperation model is a double start, because the company has suggested that we now have a company's money coupon plus zero electricity to enter.

So last year's revenue was actually not as good as the previous year's corporate playtime revenue, including market guests. So last year's figures were as if it was said that as long as the top 30 had the opposite side of him, it was already very much related. Of course, it is not yet profitable to invest in itself, whether it is above the staff or above the geographical area, so the computer is not yet profitable, but it has received very clear results.

It's good to ask, since this facility has been created over the years since 30,000 years since the main reasons are many kinds of specifications, and for 30 years it comes from our software value part of the loneliness of conservation is not the first problem. I say that the luck of its software itself is really high compared to the distorted nature of the software.

This is the first. The second question is, for example, that we now have a lot more stock market plans than in the past, three times more, April 20, March 60, that is the first indicator. But if you now have our capacity cost, there is a way to afford such a large capacity, if your business war beauty is like that, so its size and quantity may be more than the average stock market profit, but the current capacity price may not be able to support, so I refer to the fact that there is, I do not want to create such a way.

In addition, after all, the VQC is mainly used in some industries, but the QC once in the people company and production effect, is actually a relatively large burden, so in the case of the need for production, there are many standardized parts, which will allow us to make a lot of extra use space on the production, but also solve other cracks in the production part, because of the stability of the first words, so in the same production hotline, affect its production, so we can supply the part, we will do a lot of the development of the basic quantum. We are zero available industry, because it is usually used most, but still in the current production situation, there is a demand, but because the floor area is still used thick, the level can be expanded, so this year we use the number, today, our capacity can still improve, we can still improve the production, and we can still have a lot of production, because we can now we can improve our ability, because we can do it is not to provide a new, because it is not only. So because of market mechanism needs, it may be this product in this country, or this time on the southeast motorcycle, there must be some adjustments on the loan, I think the price will have the right of the market, the only one we can work on is on the utility, so that the results of VALID, let us cost is actually better, so we do the description, in different products and different places, we hear different from VALID, Poro may be assumed that the market is VALID, so some products of the VALID in the actual market, it is also a market, so it is average, the market and many VALID and CAMO may be so, thank you.

One thing is certain, we have to break through this final part, it has a lot of parts, for example, if it is on the machine, there will be a big bowl, if not too much, it can have a big bowl, and then what. First answer this question, the first is, the customer, the distribution of each distribution needs software needs, for example, I remember last year all marketing to do some useful controller, this plant power needs it actually does not need ARI, no Android, but it needs nutrition board, for example, we are mainly in Europe with Quadrillion, Quadrillion, Quadrillion it is not much needed, but it needs our Lord, because it is called Tian Lin, in the city, it is medium grass, so it has other loads, so it will according to the actual use field, so some, some, some, but after all this demand, I think ARI, it needs, it is new professional application, in the market, in the United States, basically, I have a high proportion of the number chain, so I said, so I have to take the number, so I have to the number chain, so I have to control, so I have to get out of Shenzhen.

This is a rebar requirement, basically all of the digital chains will do. I would like to calculate the number chain, it can replace the demand. Or some customers confess that they are all mature. The good news is that from last year, some customers have completely switched this data. So I think that this is an AI program in 2HATS.

It's really a bit fast, all of these operations end up with the results of the efficiency of the product's customers. Of course, until now this video still has a considerable connection, it's in the chemical industry. That's Gene's result. That's a relatively new way of marketing. That's also a relatively new way of doing business. So after mentioning this procedure, it started using this game from over a year ago.

So time is short. So why is MoVie special?. Because Movie is, the year is, say. Initial accounting is the resource we are using now, sebagai supplies. Mexi, this is the way to fail.

This game, Gene's thing, as long as we're very good at it. Especially, it uses befineS logical, which is Gene. It's very commercial.

Then we went through this one by the way л marks. This game machine's Quant beneath, which is Vanee Goa-on-time. This part is advantageous. I'm here to ask a question. That's what I hear from you.

As Mr. Dong said, because there is a mention of it, it is said. Hua Tie. This piece of vegetarian classic. It has been verified that it can be improved. Time to improve efficiency.

I mean, that's what I mean. For example, if a veggie stall on an iron stand is a vegetarian stall, it's a classic right now, and it's all ours.

This is the way of the righteous, the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked.

They may not be able to do so, but they are able to do so because they are able to do so, and because they are able to do so, they are able to do so, and because they are able to do so, they are able to do so.

Now the customers who do the software are actually the customers who are not really customers, and we are in the vegetarian classic, back in the sea, it is just a concept of a person.

However, it is treated with one thing, if it is not used, electrical equipment, then it is imported directly into electric power.

That's it. It's the opposite. We're just talking about the electric power. I'm going to explain it again. I'm going to say yes. I'm flying on the post above QA.

Or the whole. Food chain operations related. Requires a telecom bus. Or Post or other above. Can have these four non-citizen operations. That's just mentioned.

He has a wealth of knowledge, and he has a wealth of knowledge, but he does not need to do it.

Huajie includes Angiobot. Here it needs to be lower than the compute. It needs to be run. There will be a short time supply. Because of this power system, it must be used.

This is Local computing power. Make the AI work you need. Show it. So, it will need to be another post. Do this kind of computing exercise.

It is not the same as the original Post system, so it is separate. For the plane, it is an extra. above the power.

The two of them are similar to each other, and they are similar to each other, but they are similar to each other, and they are similar to each other.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

That's it, that's it, that's it.

That's it, that's it, that's it.

That's it, that's it, no, that's not.

That's it, that's it, latt.

Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.

Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Dream. Happy. Happy.

Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.

Happy. Happy. Drawing. Available. In the light of space. OK.

I can do that, that, that, and then that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

After that, after that, after that, after that, after that.

The following are the paragraph type transcripts after re-routing:. I probably 2023, 2024 more than a year, can only. If there is no failure, that is because I see from above, that is, last year more than 10 million, right. Then this year may be, so I remember him about, is last year if possible, I feel that the whole year is about 3,000 acceleration, I hope that you can accelerate the subscription rate of each month one day three days, maybe I feel that one person can reach their own stage, but if I said that I should say that the future distribution reward is very big, then if there is not a billion dollars, because there is no too much cost, it will not be more than a year.

Then conforming. For comfort. Relative weight for. 301 replacement comparison is very high. Because 2 or 3 years base period is like this. But last year the base period came high.

So in total 7 years there will still be a substantial increase in the number of years. The basis period is the highest in that base period. I think that the type of allegation over the years is very very very. That is to say, the part of foreign investment is called to fall this year. That is to say, a narrow rule to do it.

Because this year's imports are the same as last year's. In fact, the currency of this year has gained some more. But the low cost is from the degree of Chinese coins, but there is another one.

So there is another part of this income, this section itself, this period of value, can be hardware, the consumption of the income, and we are the tek creation.

There are some M&R related, usually set up in contrast to the situation, but it is very developed, we have it, we do not want to go up, we have time.

Because after all, it is. We are not ourselves operating in the company itself. So our retail ratio is actually too high. So we need to compare it up. Time. Take it to the center.

I just want to ask a question. Aerial AI takes the question. In fact, you're more likely to be Bladeoff. At least than Bladeoff. Investing in prehe doesn't win. Can't get it.

Now I have organizations. Including MILM. Also relevant. Breakthrough Center. The result of the product. Thank you for your attention.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided. It looks like these may come from meetings or discussions, involving topics such as tariffs, market strategies, supplier selection, etc. The timestamp displays the start time of each sentence, but the user requests a paragraph type, so the timestamp may not need to be retained, but needs confirmation. However, the user does not mention the processing of timestamps, so it may be necessary to retain, or the user may want to remove the timestamp, only the text.

For example, in the example given by the user, the converted paragraph-oriented text is plain text, and there is no timestamp. Therefore, I need to remove the timestamp, keep only the content of the sentence, and group them into paragraphs logically. Next, I need to analyze the content in a sentence to determine which sentences belong to the same topic or the same topic in order to make reasonable segmentation. For example, the previous sentences discuss market selection and company strategy, and then may turn to tariff issues, and then on supplier selection and customer feedback, which may ultimately involve efficiency improvement and work-related content.

For example, some sentences may just be "that" or "repetitive", but they may need to be kept as readable by segmentation. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to some possible spelling mistakes or non-standard terms, such as "king sharpener", "trade certificate", etc., but also can not be modified, can only be retained as is. At the same time, some sentences may involve proprietary terms or terms such as "wolf", "ilippine", etc., need to be verified that the user does not provide context, so keep the original. When organizing paragraphs, it is necessary to ensure that each paragraph is surrounded by a topic such as tariff issues, supplier selection, market strategy, etc.

This is the time when we need to care, not say. Some companies on the ground floor may be satisfied, and there will be some options. That is because in the market, after all, there are some people in the land prices where Americans are more conservative, because this is more negative about the delivery rate of resources. The first question to ask is, because if there is such a tariff, it seems to be the case.

Like here, or we go to the utility limited by this tariff, in fact, is it possible to set up taxes in the United States? Another question is that the recent 47th set of orders for the United States lads is very good, I would like to say that there is no possibility that this is a large amount of tax to be paid, because after all, each of the funds are so strong, they call the necessary expansion, another consideration is that they actually feel very interested in our lads' lease, so the back of that is the key part, because it is unclear this time in several countries between the tax and the country, or the repetition between the tax, it is a lot of change, so in this point to make some assumptions to not call back to the opponents, for example, we want to put the entire economic high rate and then the whole new rate is certainly high, so there is no way, so there is a relatively high. As a result of the time relationship, we want to share the last thing we want to ask is to say that in this first life thing, we see every customer specifically choose Taiwan's supplier's share of this role is more difficult compared to other China or the company, because this ID is a soft so there are some countries, but we know that in the actual case there are some customers directly sell orders to include the amount of this currency in Taiwan, but it is not necessary to consider how much we have to buy in Taiwan and then do so so before we export to the United States, so we do so before we start the design so there is this, but after this market is a lot of competition, and then we will talk about the relatively high income. of the number of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the of the number of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the of the number of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the of the number of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the of the number of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the variances of the The total number of participants is 1.

I am, but you are only here to say that last year after the second half of the year is really no, all, we, we, they did, they confirmed them, plus, compared, not, these franchises are chain stores, their stores actually have quite a standard, in fact, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, how, how, now, that is, now, disadvantage, in fact, the home, the previous terminal, that is so, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank, thank.
