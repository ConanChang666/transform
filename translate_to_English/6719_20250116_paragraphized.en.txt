<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcripts provided by the user and organize them into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and kept the original intention intact.

This means that I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or the same paragraph, and then combine them to remove the timestamp, but retain the order and integrity of the sentence. Next, I need to deal with duplicate content. For example, there are multiple "thank you for your cooperation" repeated in the transcripts provided by the user, which need to be kept in the paragraph and cannot be deleted. At the same time, pay attention to the connection between the sentences to ensure that the paragraphs are smooth, but do not change the original intention.

For example, a sentence after a timestamp may need to be merged into the previous sentence or a later sentence, forming a natural transition. Then, I will analyze it by a sentence, sorting the sentence after the timestamp in order, and segmenting it according to the content. For example, the opening part may include instructions for greetings and meetings, and then the presentation of the meeting structure, and then the detailed report of the financial data, and the final part of the balance sheet. Each section needs to be independent, but keep the original order of the sentence.

In addition, the user mentions "do not delete any sentences", which means that even if some sentences look duplicated or redundant, they must be preserved, such as "thank you for your cooperation" mentioned many times. Finally, I will read the finishing paragraph verbatim text to check if all the user's requirements are met: no delete, rewritten, or condensed content, all the sentences are arranged in order, the logical coherence between the paragraphs, the timestamp is handled correctly, and no information is left out.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, the online corporate briefing session will be held for two minutes. Please keep your microphone silent and avoid interference with the presentation. After the presentation will enter Q&A time, you can enter your question in the chat window at the bottom right corner of the screen, and the company team will reply. Thank you for your cooperation. [There are about 30 seconds blank here] Thank you for your cooperation.

Thank you for your cooperation. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the online investor briefing will be officially started. Let's give the time to Mr. Chiu Kin-bang, the chief financial officer of Inspiring Electronics. I am Mr. Chiu Kin-bang, the chief financial officer of Inspiring Electronics, and I am honored to be invited by Fubon Securities to hold the online investor briefing for the fourth quarter of 2024.

The conference will be divided into three parts, first from here to illustrate the operation results of the fourth quarter of 2024 and the relevant figures of the fourth quarter of 2024 and then there will be the general manager Mr. Huang Xuewei share the company's operational outlook, and finally Q&A time, we will reply to the relevant questions raised after the conclusion of the presentation. First of all, I came here to explain the operation results of the fourth quarter of 2024 with advanced investment. The operating revenue of the fourth quarter of the overall revenue of inspirational electrons is 9.3 billion, the operating revenue of the relevant operating revenue is 9.3 billion, and the operating revenue of the relevant operating revenue is 9.3 billion, compared to the third quarter of the total operating revenue of the company.

In the fourth quarter, the total amount of outstanding losses 28 million, roughly affecting the company's overall gross profit margin of 3 percentage points. The operating expenses of the fourth quarter, the operating expenses of the fourth quarter increased from 2.1.4 billion in the fourth quarter to 3.05 billion, the main reason is that the relevant mid-term customers in the use of MOS products involves some patent infringement-related lawsuits, so the company in the fourth quarter increased the total operating costs of the lawsuit to 3.60 million, the total operating expenses of the fourth quarter increased by about 43 percentage points, and the operating expenses of the fourth quarter increased by 32.6 percentage points, mainly affected by the overall one-time operating expenses of the total loss of the total loss of the total revenue of 1.2.7 million, the total loss of the total loss of the total loss of the total loss of the total loss of the total revenue of the same year is 2.30 million. 4.2 billion, so in 2024, the net profit of the overall inspirational electronics before tax was 277 billion, the net profit after tax was  2.3 billion, the whole vested interest rate was 6.2%, and the net profit per share was 2.4 billion.

This is the fourth quarter of the year in which the proportion of revenue regressed to the fourth quarter of the application, which can also correspond to the previous, the fourth quarter in the case of gross profit margin increased, mainly because of the overall product advantage of a combination, where you can see that the proportion of revenue on the computing platform and the BMS platform increased from 49% in the third quarter last year to 58% in the fourth quarter of the year, in the application of battery management systems also increased from 14% in the third quarter last year to 16% in the fourth quarter of the year, that includes communication platforms, industrial applications and consumer such as a platform, in the fourth quarter of last year due to the impact of overall inventory regulation, revenue is increasing, in the fourth quarter of the year from 24% in the third quarter of the year to the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of the year of the fourth quarter of the year of the year of the year of the third quarter of the year, the proportion of the total growth of the total of the total revenue of the year of the total growth of the total revenue of the year of the year is also accounted to the year of the year of the year of the year of the total of the revenue of the year of the total revenue of this year of the total of the 2022, and the total of the year of the total of the year of the year of the total revenue of the total of the year of the total revenue of the year of the total of this year of this year of the total revenue of the 2022 of the third.

The average number of days of sales as of the end of last year was 101 days, about 6 days from the 107 days of the third quarter of last year. The total average number of days of sales was less than 120 days from the original target. Therefore, the average number of days of sales of ICs and MOS reached a reasonable level. A non-current asset in the asset subject increased from 1.6 billion at the end of September last year to 2.6 billion at the end of December last year, adding about 1 billion. This part mainly because we bought a US$30 million bond in the fourth quarter of last year, which led to an increase in the amount of non-current assets of about 1 billion.

In the balance sheet, both the current and the non-current balances have increased significantly. This increase is mainly a reference to a one-off litigation-related fee, and the other to the loss of the contract liability contract that we have listed on TA. As a result, there is a slight increase in the total liability. The entire debt ratio increased slightly from about 14% at the end of September to 16%. In the cash flow table, in the fourth quarter of last year, the total cash flow from the operating activity generated by the cash flow table was 402 billion. This part of the project was mainly out of one of the funds of a competitor we purchased US dollar bonds.

Secondly, we made a time deposit of about 400 million. The capital expenditure is about 330 million. The rest is about 25 million cash inflows, mainly due to the employee's right to vote. Therefore, the cash balance at the end of the year is 13.47 billion. The net cash flow for the entire business activities of the company in 2024 was 12.75 billion. Last year, we issued a private equity corporate debt of about 51,800 million.

In addition, we have a privately-placed unsecured convertible corporate bond of 16.98 billion. This part of us made a time deposit of more than three months. Another part of us purchased US dollar bonds.

Second, we also issued cash to encourage about $200 million. Last year's total capital expenditure was about 83 million. The execution of employees' equity certificates about 7.5 million. Therefore, the overall end of the cash balance is 13.47 million.

The company's fourth quarter revenue declined by about 6% compared to the third quarter. The overall revenue in the second half of 2024 was nearly 10% higher than the first half of the year. In the fourth quarter, the demand for pull-outs was slowed mainly due to the stock control of traditional NETVIGATOR server markets.

Gross profit margins are subject to an increase of 9,2 percentage points, up to 33.8%, compared to the third quarter. In 2024, the gross profit margin was 3.98 billion, up about 22% compared to 2023. Gross profit margins were still affected by the amount of loss margin in the inventory. However, the gross profit margin was increased by only 30.3% compared to 2023. However, the gross profit margin has not yet reached its short-term gross margin target, Middle 30s. However, the gross profit margin has reached its short-term gross margin target if the exclusion of loss is affected.

As the large amount of stock mentioned in the past has been offset to the appropriate water level of the company's stock. Inventory loss preparations are also expected to return to reasonable levels. A positive increase in gross profit margin in 2025 is expected.

Looking ahead to the low interest rate Yik 2025, abilis and then Master said G churches are used to settled as their global A.W. operations.

This is because the overall MOSFET price is actually the main competition or this part of the manufacturer in mainland China, which in some of the low-voltage standardized products have some pressure on the price competition. However, just in terms of the overall inventory loss is a big problem, our overall inventory loss in late last year should be said to be a paragraph, so the relevant MOSFETs will be divided into two parts, so the relevant MOSFETs will continue to be sold, but if there is a sale, but this inventory loss is of course, in this part of the we are not worried about what kind of price competition, because this part of the price competition has already been listed, we really have some advantages.

The latest generation of NVIDIA-related products of our company is indeed still on the middle-end Mainstream-grade product block, which is now launched in the high-end product block, which is especially on top of the products, our main competitors are still existing manufacturers in the U.S. and U.S. and U.S. and U.S., and the main competitors are in the NVIDIA products we provide a complete Total Solution solution, including graphics card Notebook and related server applications, and we will gradually continue to use this block as the main target market, and then gradually improve the development of their high-end products, which is the most advanced and timely issue of the above industry.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [2628. 34-2630. 34] In fact, there are some effects due to the adjustment of stock. [2630. 34-2632. 34] What is the replacement? [2632. 34-2634. 34] Of course, there are parts of computing and BMS that are seen. [2634. 34-2636. 34] The effect of an entire pull-up movement is increased.

[2638. 34-2640. 34] What I would like to see in Q1 is the situation. [2640. 34-2642. 34] A little bit inversely. [2642. 34-2644. 34] After the last quarter of last year, the demand for notebook-related applications is increased here. [2644. 34-2646. 34] In fact, the first quarter, relatively stable. [2644. 34-2648. 34] The second, of course, the demand is seen in the network server industry applications here. [2648. 34-2650. 34] In fact, there is a gradual increase.

[2650. 34-2652. 34] Of course, it is also limited to the number of working days of the overall first quarter decrease. [2652. 34-2654. 34] The reason why the entire period of stay between the mainland and the mainland is long. [2656. 34-2656. 34] So we have the overall revenue of Q1 in 2025. [2656. 34-2665. 34] In fact, it is a solid direction to compare. [2658. 34-2660. 34] The gross profit margin portion is mostly returned. [2660. 34-2662. 34] A product is a product.

[2662. 34-2664. 34] That is the part of our total stock price loss. [2664. 34-2666. 34] Foreseeable effect of this part in 2025. [2666. 34-2668. 34] Should return to normal level. [2668. 34-2670. 34] This part is mentioned, roughly here in MOS. [2670. 34-2672. 34] Especially some of the MOS battery. [2672. 34-2674. 34] In fact, it is also mentioned.

[2674. 34-2676. 34] So the gross profit margin part, we actually have a positive direction. [2676. 34-2678. 34] That's the last answer. [2678. 34-2682. 34] There's a new question for other industry advances now online. [2682. 34-2684. 34] Industry advances to ask why the Q4 VGA revenue went down. [2684. 34-2686. 34] Q1 VGA's revenue is growing.

[2686. 34-2688. 34] The financial aspect of this information, I ask the Chief Financial Officer to help supplement it. [2688. 34-2690. 34] I answered a little bit of the question here. [2690. 34-2690. 34] The decline in overall VGA revenue was not really as large as the decline in the fourth quarter. [2692. 34-2694. 34-2696. 34] In fact, in the fourth quarter, there should be a transition period for such a power management IC and its MOSFET.

[2698. 34-2700. 34] In fact, some of the products are actually shared. [2700. 34-270.2. 34] It is only a so-called multi-phase controller which is the part of VCode. [2702. 34-2704. 34] There are actually some changes. [2704. 34-27064. 34] It is like some Dr. MOS or some other. [2706. 34-2708.3] It is actually all of it has some continuity. [2708. 34-27010. 34] In this section.

[2710. 34-2712. 34] So I think that the decline in VGA revenue for Q4 is just a product handover process. [2712. 34-2714. 34] The vendor's short-term condition on stock preparation. [2714. 34-2716. 34] That is whether the total revenue for Q1 VGA can grow. [2716. 34-2717. 34] I think this part is going to look at the needs of the overall market. [2718. 34-2720. 34] The new 50 series of contributions and the enthusiasm for demand. [2720. 34-2722. 34] How to decide.

[2722. 34-2724. 34] Because the relevant spare parts should be in Q4 and even in a small part of this year's Q1. [2724. 34-2726. 34] It is actually finished. [2726. 34-272728. 34] It should be relatively similar to the 80 series and the nine series launched at the beginning. [2728. 34-2730. 34-2732.34] This relatively high-end version. [2730. 34-2732. 34] The high-end version of it used to be the whole sales situation. [2732. 34-2734] In fact, the number is not so much.

[2734. 34-2736. 34] This is not a focus of UBI's first steps to develop. [2736. 34-2738. 34] The next part will begin to be released. [2738. 34-2740. 34-274. 34] This part is the part that UBI is able to contribute more in terms of revenue. [2742. 34-27464. 34] The land continues to look at the entire state of 507-70. [2744. 34-746. 34]

[2746. 34-24748. 34] So I think there is a chance in Q1 here but. [2748. 34-275. 34] It still has some uncertainty. [2750. 34-2755.2. 34] This is the impact of market demand on the face. [2752. 34-2754.3] There is some uncertainty. [2754. 34-27564. 34] Well, there is a question about the advanced industry online and in a timely manner. [2756. 34-2758.3. 34] It is just mentioned in the MOS used by a particular customer.

[2758. 34-2760. 34] Whether or not the infringing issue can be shipped. [2760. 34-276.2. 34] The current operation of the company and the shipping of this related MOS. [2762. 34-27664. 34] There is no impact on this. [2764. 34-27664. 34] This MOS can actually be shipped in principle. [2766. 34-276. 34] In addition, the operation of Q1 particle electronics by 2025 can be of some help. [2768. 34-276. 34] In this financial situation, I also ask Mr. Beni.

[2770. 34-2772. 34] I'll report this first.

In 2025, the new year is different. Application of new GPU platform. Particle electronics is ready. The relevant certified products are also working hard.

Promote Design. and DesignWin finances. In this case, I would like to ask the CFO to supplement it. This benefit is definitely benefiting from VGA.

Just to say its magnitude. How big is the increase. As I just explained it or not. Depends on the subsequent needs. In fact, an example of this 50 series of graphics cards.

The whole series was launched. In fact, it was called. Dr. MOS Dr. MOS just mentioned here. That is, the UPI is ready for good. This project was the past. We compared the focus of Dr. MOS.

The focus is on notebooks. There are a small number of models. That's with the whole. Graphics cards are all bold. Under the circumstances of Dr. MOS. UPI exists.

This is the way of the righteous, the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked, and the way of the wicked.

This is a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, a new creation, and a new creation.

Depends on the whole need to decide. The second is still the competition. There are also some among the peers. Some on Market share.

High and low. Determines such a part. But the entire 50 series of VGA graphics cards. The launch is also UPI. It will definitely benefit here. An impact of this part.

In addition. Industry advanced new questions. That's the question. NVIDIA's 5080 5090. Dr. MOS and Converter. Will you use inspirational.

The answer is yes. We are in. Dr. MOS and related PowerMonitor. No. Converter OVR's Program.

Controller PowerStage and PowerMonitor. Here is the inspirational electronic. Certified products are also popular with customers. I would like to be on the related platform.

Especially. PowerMonitor is. In the list of certifications. Very few. In fact, this.

This is the answer to the above question, all currently available online, relevant, and timely.

I wish you all a Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to all of you.
