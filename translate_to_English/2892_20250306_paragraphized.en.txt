<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the structure.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided, note that there are some possible spelling errors or garbled codes, such as "기뼼� beto to market", "Sithar", "uks", etc. These parts may need to be retained as they are, as users request no modification. Next, I need to reorganize these time-stamped sentences into consecutive paragraphs while maintaining the order of timestamps. Next, I will analyze the corresponding sentences for each timestamp to see which sentences can be semanticly linked together. For example, the part of the revenue forecast may need to be merged into a paragraph, and the question about fund payment rates may need to be separate.

During the processing process, I need to make sure that every sentence is arranged in its original order without missing anything. For example, the user mentions that "we predict revenue will grow by 5-6% in the middle of a number, followed by last year's yield of 9%, which should be placed in the same paragraph to show the trend of revenue growth.

In addition, the user mentioned the questions and answers section, such as Mandy Lin's questions and Eric Shih's questions, need to be organized into paragraphs separately to maintain the corresponding relationship with the answer. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp, to ensure that the timestamps for each paragraph are properly mapped, but the user may not need to retain the timestamps in the final output, so it is necessary to remove the timestamps, only the content. When dealing with the English part, such as "so we would have a project that will be 20% off of the last year's peak", it is necessary to confirm whether these sentences are relevant to the context and appropriate segmentation.

If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to further confirm, but according to the example provided by the user, it should be arranged directly in the order of timestamps, and reasonably segmented. </think> The following are the finishing paragraph-by-text transcripts (retaining all the original content, adjusting only the paragraph structure):. But you also know that there are factors that are related to the deadlines. 기를� to market in the future later period beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Sithar its uks keep protecting itself when it closes.

We recorded a strong, hard rate of return reached 9% last year. This is also due to the trend of this year's growth. And it affects our rate of return. But our large vehicles will be more normalized.

On a large yield. We will continue to forecast. The yield reached this year will reach 6-7%. The yield reached by the government this year will not be good.

So this year's large-scale vehicles with yields. Mainly from ours. The SME market. Will increase by 4%. And AVEX's yields. Especially in the market's yields.

Can grow to 11-12%. According to forecast. U.S. yields will rise. That is the value of returns. So that's our two main compositions. Help us grow our yields.

Thank you Annie. Our yields are this year. They are mainly driven by SMEs and AVEX. We believe this will also help us to grow our yields. So the yields for SMEs will reach 4%. The yields for AVEXs will reach 11-12%.

Then. There is a problem from Mandy Lin. Fubang problem. Mandy wants to know about our shrinkage growth. Our shrinkage growth. Forecast is from 2025 to 2025.

12.5 billion. This is our forecast. There is another question from us. Long Outlook forecast. It is also possible to answer this question.

Another problem is Eric Shih. He wants to know about our money payment problem. Because in recent years, our payment rate is about 50%. Then our fund payment rate in 2024. There is also about 50%.

In addition, our funding payment rate is around 50%. Even if we accept the IRB method, the value will rise. If we choose the IRB method, the area ratio will also rise.

What is our cost? Then we will have a relationship. Our factors will be Grüster. I would like to answer the question of Mrs. Cheng. So connectic σ. And I read it myself in question 지문 diamond selection.

Yes. Yes. Yes. The map is covered. 14. 8% so last year even outperformed the prior year's level and this year will be lower because of the US dollar rate has gone down so we would like to project there will be 20% off the last year's this is the end of the question to the prior swaps inquiry and talking about our dividend policy that we have entered into the IRB next year so I have to renovate to this year's dividend policy to be maintained at that time.

What I can explain here is that we need to be able to do more than that. We need to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that. We want to do more than that.
