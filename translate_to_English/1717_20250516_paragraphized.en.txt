<think> Ok, now I need to process the script of the user and organize it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, can only adjust the punctuation, line change, and paragraph merge, while keeping the original order and meaning.

In addition, it is necessary to fill the appropriate punctuation marks at the end of the sentence. You can not change lines in the same paragraph, only use empty lines, each paragraph recommends 3-6 sentences, and the theme is changed again. First, I will read the entire transcript to understand the overall structure and content. It looks like this is a transcription of an online legal person's briefing, including the dialogue of the host and spokespersons, as well as the reporting of financial data.

Then, according to the logical segmentation of the content, such as opening introduction, financial data reporting, quarterly performance analysis, treasury stock resolutions, etc. Each paragraph should contain 3-6 sentences to ensure that the subject is coherent and avoid switching the subject in the paragraph. During the processing process, it is necessary to pay attention to the processing of the timestamp, and the user requests that the output contains no timestamp, so it is necessary to remove it. At the same time, to check whether there are duplicate or redundant sentences, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so even if there is a duplicate need to be retained.

For example, data such as "50%", "25%", "2 to 1" and "1 to 1" must remain the same. At the same time, pay attention to the conversion of Chinese and English punctuation points to ensure full-form Chinese punctuation. There may be technical problems during the processing process, such as the processing of timestamps, the processing of duplicate content, the addition of punctuation symbols, etc.

For example, there is a phrase "[325. 36-325. 44] So if what I'm saying is that this part of January is in January last year in the Maori relatively high equipment, the number of acceptance of the machine is more," the sentence repeats after the timestamp, needs to be combined to avoid repeating. Finally, after finishing the finishing, it is necessary to read the entire paragraph script again to check whether all the requirements are met: no deletion of any content, the punctuation is correct, the paragraph is reasonable, the subject switching is separated by empty lines, no use of formatting tags, only output of plain text. Make sure that the output contains only the compiled text, no additional instructions or formatting.

First of all, I would like to introduce the company's management team today: Spokesperson Liu Bingchen, and the CEO of Chu Ruixin. Next time, I would ask the company to present a briefing, and the second half will be open to investors to ask questions.

Today, I am going to give you a briefing about the first quarter of the law briefing. I think that is the first part of the company, we have said a few times, and this part will ask you for your reference. Here is the evolution of the company's products, and then the global production base sales point, and then the turnover ratio.

In fact, in the balance sheet, the financial structure of the first quarter is not very different from last year's end of 24 years, including a percentage of several major subjects, basically roughly the same. On the performance of the following financial indicators, the word here contains the number of sales days fill, but there is probably an increase, but this should be a seasonal factor, mainly because of the impact of the first quarter holidays, the turnover is probably the traditional, probably due to the four quarters of our turnover will be relatively low, compared to the four quarters above the number of first days, it is likely to be a higher situation, this should be a factor of the seasonality.

This is the first part of the plan, and the first part of the plan is to maintain a certain level of growth, the cost rate is likely to be slightly increased, the main part is likely to be due to the decrease in revenue in the first quarter, which is relatively low. Therefore, the overall EQ, in fact, the business situation is relatively stable, we are still relatively a relatively stable state. The rest of the information, please refer to this.

We have just mentioned that 25-year EQ, if compared to 24-year EQ, about a slight increase in the situation, YOY is 0.4%, then compared to the fourth quarter of last year, about 10% less than QOQ, that is, compared to the first quarter of last year, is about 5.1% less than that of the first quarter of the year. This is the main reason, the first reason is because the first Q, in January, in fact, here, is that in January, the business situation in January, it seems to be quite special, that in January, the number of sales and profits are very good. In addition, this part of the product portfolio, in January, in the Maori relatively high equipment, the acceptance of the machine is actually more.

In the first quarter, we see that this is the performance of the EQ in various institutions, and this quarter looks relatively better, in fact, this part of the numerical part. The main thing is that in the first quarter, a shipment of the electronic material can be maintained. At the same time, this part of the gross and gross margin is affected by some cost factors, and it should be profitable. So we see that the portion of its profit is likely to have some increase in YoY and QOQ.

The company's main consideration here is the recent fluctuation in the stock market, relatively large, the company here in order to protect the rights of shareholders, in order to protect the rights of shareholders, a buy back case of stock stock, a resolution. It is expected to buy back in a two-month period, a proportion of the market, a share of 10,000 shares in the market, a price range of 20 to 30 shares. This part of this part of the statement is probably the last week, the board in addition to the first quarter of the financial report, a more important external market announcement of this message.

Hello, thank you for the Minister's explanation. Then there is the exchange time of the Q&A. We are here to use, it is a direct or verbal question or text question welcome. If you have any questions, welcome to open the microphone directly.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcription. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that the corresponding sentences are fully understood. The user emphasizes that it cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be preserved by sentence-by-word. Next, I need to identify the start time of each timestamp and arrange the corresponding sentences in order. The user has some interval between the transcriptions, such as [996. 16-999. 22 to [999. 22-1000. 76], which need to be connected consistently.

Then, I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and merge them into natural smooth paragraphs. For example, combine consecutive sentences into paragraphs while maintaining the integrity of each sentence. For example, [996. 16-999. 22] followed by [999. 22-1000. 76], these two sentences should be combined into a paragraph because they are continuous in time and are consistent in content.

In addition, some sentences may have a small interval between timestamps, but according to the context, it may be necessary to put them in the same paragraph to maintain the continuity of the conversation. In addition, the "plaza" section referred to by the user, which involves questions about revenue and IPO progress, needs to be ensured that the content is properly segmented, and each question and its answers are fully preserved. For example, the user asks the square last year's revenue and this year's outlook, the answer section needs to be mapped to the question, keeping the original order. Finally, check the entire paragraph typed text to make sure that there are no missing any sentences, all the timestamps and content are accurate.
