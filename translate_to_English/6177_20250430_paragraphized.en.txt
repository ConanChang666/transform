The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcript:. Dear Colleagues, I would like to thank you for joining us at the conference co-organised by the same national law today.

Next, we will talk about the company's financial situation. Then, Mr. Lee will tell us about the case and the direction of the planning. Then, we will start the meeting today.

First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Lee for inviting our company to participate in this legislative meeting. Then I would like to thank you all my colleagues for being so active to participate in this meeting. Thank you all. I would like to introduce myself first. I am a spokesperson for Dali Construction.

That's what today's legislative meetings are all about. First, I'll talk about some of the company's current state of affairs. Report and explain to you. Next, we'll have our financial manager to report some of our business distributions for the past year. Next, we'll have our general manager Lee to report some of our online cases.

There are a few strategies that the company does not need to develop in the future. Then we will proceed with the QA, and we will report to you. But this is our agenda today.

First of all, let us report to you your statement. That is, today's report is based on some of the information available to the public today. That may be due to policy or some economic changes in the future. There will be some. So we do not guarantee that this will happen in the future. This part of your statement will make a report.

That's the first part of the company inspection. Our company is 102 years old. Comparatively. Then, the word is in Shuangbei. Then, with Taichung Tainan Kaohsiung and the American branch office. Some of our company recommendation points will have a recommendation in the province and a recommendation point.

I would like to make a reference. The company's capacity is 250 people. That's 20 years. But I report to you. Because our chairman came into this industry from the age of 20. He often told me that he did this work in the company.

That's why our company's operations are also affected by its economy. The company is a solid company. It's what we do. It's a step by step.

Some of his background relationships. This is a link to our company. Reports like the one we have today. The Hong Kong Dollar Construction is our company. We have Darly USA in the US. We also have a company with a 100% investment called Darly Construction.

Then there is the part of the building that we have bail for. Then there is the part of the mall which we are developing in Dali United States. So now we have some of the companies that we have downloaded throughout the company. Some of the product design aspects of our company. We have the pattern for the appearance and the pattern for that. And there is the part for his light.

We're really curious about the color of the light. That is, our company is in the design. We're all looking for some more famous. Then the designer design our appearance. Then he's going to be more attractive. Because our customer base is clear.

It is the young man who is hand-constructed. Then we are more familiar with some of the forms of design that young people like. Next, we are part of our public office. In fact, we are going to investigate first. We are going to investigate after each case.

It's what young people love about public facilities. Everyone knows that there's that recently. It's the indoor golf. It's someone who knows that this omi is not in the planning to do this. We've really done a bowling game in Kaohsiung.

I think our company will actually be more attentive in this regard. It will be more careful than other suggestions. Then it is his pattern. Our company is generally speaking. Our company is 70% of the finished design. It is two and three-digit products.

We do not have any tags for When We Were Young [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics.

This is how you get the most out of it, and how you get the most out of it, and how you get the most out of it, and how you get the most out of it, and how you get the most out of it, and how you get the most out of it.

If you have a large bag, and if you have a large bag, it will have a large bag efficiency. The tube he asks for is very good for the situation. The tube will dilute your hair. So if we build our own factory.

That would be more efficient in quality tools and cost control. Next, because we are the manufacturer. In fact, its size is not small. The cost of 2025 is 4.4 billion. 2024 is 4.4 billion. The goal of 2025 is 8 billion.

So it is also a part of our company that we can contribute to revenue. This is our own factory. That's what we're talking about in Daly America. We're 203 households. That's 56 households. But 45 households in 56 have already been rented.

We keep it for a while. That's why we rent. The first U.S. mortgage rate is too high right now. So it's already been to that dog fight. That's why some of the U.S. states are not so clear. Then we'll wait for it to be clear.

Let's do the following adjustments again. That also says that Trump's strategy for reducing interest rates is successful. The rest is a bit more detailed. I'll report to you that we've made it. Some are in channels.

In planning. And then we say. Because the idea of building relative Taiwan in the United States is complex. When you get the building and move on, it's good time for that. It's like we've got two cases.

It is also after getting the building to save it directly. So that the income can be realized immediately. Then it is our company in the high school just next to this mall. This mall is next to the high one. In fact, the company wants to invest in a previous action before the mall.

This is a high of 500 beds. For example, the largest house in the North is more than 500 beds. There will be the one in the area of 500 beds. That's what we asked before investing in high one.

Or high one. They don't know you. So we're going to invest boldly. Because if it's 500 beds, he lights up the medical staff every day. That's the family and executive of the patient.

He said, "Every day is a day when the Lord will be with us, and we will be with him, and he will be with us, and we will be with him, and he will be with us, and we will be with him in Paradise."

This is the Day of Resurrection, when the people will be gathered together, and they will be gathered together, and will be gathered together, and will be gathered together, and they will be gathered together, and will be gathered together, and will be gathered together, and will be gathered together.

That's the case. Almost every year will contribute to the company $200 million of that person. There is a flow of this person. So this is also a big help to the company. Then next about that company. Last year 2024.

This year's end, in fact, I want to be able to report in recent years. Dear friends, about last year's fine period, our company talked about a good time, by the end of last year, we combined to receive a total of 12.3 billion, which, although it is called 2023, is about 3 billion, but because our labor rate and net interest rate increase significantly, so PPS is better than the previous year's ranking, so EPS reached 5.5. That's what we see, in fact, because our current gross interest rate is about 30%, in fact, about 25%, compared to the previous three years, about 5 percent more points, then the net interest rate from 13% to 17.5, in the future we will be able to achieve, the net interest rate is also the goal of more than 20%. 5 indicators to encourage, a total of 4 dollars, the recommended strike rate is nearly 80%, the conversion of the current colonization rate has reached more than 8%, so it is believed that we share with you the profits of this spirit, the strike rate is good, so if you look ahead to the average four years of encouraging strike rate has reached nearly 67. 93%, in fact, its overall strike rate is 7 percent.

In the next 10 years, in fact, we have already bought a lot of land stock in the circumstances, our annual proposals or the annual completion of the time frame are basically sorted, so in the future, in fact, we should be able to gradually reach this we mentioned is about 60% or more, and of course, it is also a good feedback for the shareholders involved in this follow-up growth. Then, we ask our general manager to explain the case.

This year, we mainly rely on our Taipei Dali military, this case sales is 34.500 million, the current sales rate is 100%, the progress of the case, because we originally set the target in July, according to the recent rain factors, and some import material ratio, we aim to set up at the end of August can get a practical photo, this is no problem, the overall progress is about a month later, before the end of the year to complete all the sales is no problem. The case that we just pushed this year, because he is a lower floor, we can also rank next year, the current sales rate is also up to 25, in the next year part of the we have just three Dali twin stars, the case is more special, we were ranked in 2026 to enter the fight, well, because the case tells us that we encountered the event of the chicken tire at the time, we are in the three regions, in the first three areas is very unstable incentive conditions, so we determined to put the safety support of the basement and some of the block measures to strengthen, added support, and added some block measures, so the whole basement workers have done more than six months, so we took his entire job after, the completion time to 2027.

Even his high-rises have been broken. Some of the high-priced homes in the area. Even the hosts should have been appointed to 60. The world science is also a case of our proposal this year.

We have a future to the world from all ages. At present, his sales rate is 35%. The case is about 420,000 right now. The 2025 we just mentioned. We remember that the total amount of the proposal can reach 2.2 million. Next, I will report some details of the case with you.

It was just mentioned that the case was in the Beitou Shilin Science Park. He was also near a park in Kinmen Fort. The case was now covered up to the 3rd floor. The structure was already on the 3rd floor. Because it is the 3rd floor, so it is not very high.

Next year is sure to be completed. And our case in Taipei is really controlled, but it's still stable. He's under 3 on 14. So the speed is still flat. His main project performance is up to 60 billion. Just mentioned in the world of science.

His base area is more than 1800 meters. The total floor area is 14000. So he has 376 homes and 382 parking spaces. The current sales volume has reached 30%. So it is probably just the one we are talking about.

He has 2 to 3 room types. There is no big number. The biggest one is 30 square feet. But that amount is big. The main number is 22 to about 28 square feet. The total sales amount of this can reach 41 billion.

That's why we're at the top of the Daly Rocks in Xitun, Taichung. This case is called the cold break. In that area, the cold break is a famous area. He's on the road in Taiwan. It's also on the green line that the MRT is already operating. The blue line with the blue decade will open.

MRT Blue Line intersection. I personally walk about 7 minutes from the base of this case to the MRT station. 7 minutes to the green line. It is what it is.

This total sales amount is also 41 billion. We started selling now. So the progress of sales is about 15%. This case is because it is located in the area of Nanjinghua, Taichung. The average price of his current sales is about 73 yuan. And that's what we're doing in Tainan.

It is also a public sale of our regular hours. At that time, you should know that this place in Tainan is also part of an evolutionary area. Our first phase of the sale may be from R12R12. That is, it is a relatively public release. We usually publish on the other side of the page.

But in the first phase, the total sales amount will also be about 81 billion. What we are talking about is that we are simply the progress of Dali itself. After 2028, about 6 to 7 years or even 8 years. We have made a simple inventory of our cases to report to you. The future direction of the company has changed a bit.

As you can see, the orange part above is our so-called office root or self-hosted root. That part accounts for 6 percent of the total amount of our company's development and operation. That in the yellow part is our rapid development. The Jebsen case accounts for about 28 of our development volume. The remaining 28 is our self-build.

Our case is self-built. So the part of the case is for your reference. So look at the area of our base, for example, the whole down. The accumulation is about 36000 square meters. So in the near future, about 10 years our land is not accurate. That is, it is not enough.

The good news is that we are all working on this. Of course we need to do something to give back to the city or to the MRT. Then we will distribute some things like the Department of Defense that we want to do.

The benefit is that our land costs will be relatively small. So the entire capital pressure will be much reduced. That we continue to recommend for the next three years. The amount of agricultural sales will be about 10 billion. There will be more than 10 billion. That 2028 to 2033 within six years.

We count the cases for a preliminary estimate. He is nearly 1.2 billion six years old. We average about 20 billion each year. Of course, we finished our own self-determination. So sometimes you just don't have to. But we count about 20 billion.

A good part of Taiwan. First, let's report some of our recent major disasters. We made more than 13 billion in Tainan on March 11th this year. We are the people of Tainan here. We are strong from one country to the world.

Sales are pretty good. The president is also very confident about this. Because it is a new area of the future, a major town. So we are continuing to develop here too. Although we see only 1353 million right now. We continue to work with the camps around us to not rule out the use of nuclear weapons.

Expand our development of tuition fees. We hope to reach 30 billion or even 40 billion. Then we are in March and April respectively. We are also in Kaohsiung Zuoying Village and Pingtung City station. A joint company with one of the best applicants. We also develop projects.

The two cases will be covered in detail. That is, on March 30, we completed the annual cash appreciation. Our share capital has reached 448 billion. That is, this year we also announced that the cash dividends we want to distribute are 3.5% and 0.5% of stocks.

We are a modern and international real estate developer. We all have two projects that we recommend last year. So long-term goals are still expected to be sustainable. We can contribute this profit together with our investors. So we have to report with you last year.

We're really making progress this year. From our Iron Mountain MRT shopping mall to Aquiwan. Aquiwan is our first MRT opening house. It's expected to be built in October of this year. Construction is expected because we'll be named after it. Then we can start with the MRT unit.

Proportion of distribution. After the distribution is over. Start working. It is also expected that there will be an opportunity to start working next year. Next is the Huang County of Kaohsiung last year. It is expected to come to the Kaohsiung City Government in June.

This is a recent target. We will start with this donation unit. We will only invest one unit. Because the base stock price is large. We think these two units can be developed together. Our goal has always been this way.

We are the people of the town, and we are the people of the town. `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim texts and convert them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed to any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. It looks like this is a presentation about real estate projects, involving geographical location, accessibility, surrounding facilities, company strategy, and market analysis.

First of all, I will check through the sentences to make sure that there are no missing sentences. Then, according to the context logic, group the relevant sentences. For example, the parts of the geographic location and traffic can be combined into a paragraph, followed by the surrounding facilities, then the company assessment and future planning. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic, but are separated by timestamps, and need to be rearranged.

In addition, some sentences may be repeated or paused in spoken language, such as "that of course we are at the time of this bidding" followed by the planning of the train station and the residence, which needs to be ensured that the content is smooth in the paragraphs. It is also necessary to check if there are errors or inconsistencies in the timestamp, such as some timestamps in the verbs provided by the user, but according to the user's request, only to handle the content part, timestamps can be ignored. Finally, after completing the segmentation, read through the entire paragraph verbatim, make sure that the original sentences are correctly contained, no omissions or errors, and the transition between paragraphs are natural, in line with the logical structure of the speech.

The location of this base is quite good. So look at the Zuoying high-speed rail about five to ten minutes by car. The future straight line and the county gate of the Red Line MRT station. He should be the nearest MRT station to the city.

The headquarter of the Sun and Moon are located here. There are also other naval hospitals around. The naval hospital, etc., Kaohsiung University is also nearby.

When we first looked at this case, we were very conservative. We initially looked at the price of a single ping. It was only about 40 o'clock to estimate. So you want to think about this future issue of the rapid transit and this lotion. Maybe the price should be more than here.

So we can look forward to this case. Then it is the nearest Pingtung train station. Just mentioned that the Eastern District of Pingtung is really at the train station. We should be praying in April. I especially don't want to go around here.

The surrounding area contains a victory new village. Recently this is counted as a model of a county chairman's family. A habit of a village change. A revitalized place. There is also our Pingtung Park. Pingtung University.

There is a Pacific department store near the train station. One of the main Pacific department stores. It is probably the most pleasant road. There is a high-speed rail reservation in addition to the future areas. In fact, it is only a station. We can also look at this place.

That's why we're in this contest. We're probably going to be in the train station, we're probably in the train station, we're probably in the same room as our house. On the second floor and the first floor we're going to make a local connection. Let's walk straight from the train station to this mall. Our goal planning is probably three buildings.

Three of the three buildings are located on the ground floor of the 32nd floor. The first to third floor is probably a shopping mall. We are in the classic management. We are in the ten-year building. That is, of course, in the industry section. We continue to cooperate with these universities.

We also went to the University of Kaohsiung to do a teaching lecture every Wednesday. At ESG we are still in the four directions. The environment affluent to improve the way we do business.

It's probably the month of April. We also took the team by ourselves. There were more than 500 trees planted there. We expected to have 2 million. The Chairman mentioned that we wanted the future.

We can only have one house for every sale. When a society grows a tree, it is because the building of a house is after all environmentally friendly. There are a number of startups. We want to enrich our environment by planting trees.

So the day we plant the trees is special. This includes the white fairy orange water king's skin and the linseed. You should know the linseed. It is a native species of Taiwan. It is characterized by windproof protection. It is also a thing that endures some of the seasides made by plateaus.

So the richness of the environment is very helpful. Of course, the staff is also through some app activities. Do some online sports. We also have about 100,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide.

We also have some potential development platform consensus. We also hope to combine some ideas of the seminar. Some of the concepts of sustainable development of the company. Able to integrate into the daily work and practice. It is still continuous through these activities.

In order to invite our colleagues to participate in some social methods. Implement some activities in the body. Finally, we focus on the whole future. Statistics on the dynamics of the physical temperament. A separate view with our company. After the market opened the house last year from the low cell of 919.

Plus the effect of the recent U.S. tariffs on the whole. The company does not have a current case. What is the section of the recent news scene. What else is there any reductions. In the company there is actually no such situation. But the total real estate actually has a significant reduction.

There are many of you who do not know me, but there are those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me, and those who do not know me.

We have been living in a house for a year and a half and a half, and we have been living in a house for a year and a half, and we have been living in a house for a year and a half, and we have been living in a house for a year and a half.

There are a number of reasons why you should make an announcement. That is to say, the entire dividend of the 2095 listed company. Especially cash. This is for cash.

We believe that these two trillions are also living water for the entire market. That means that these funds will be flowing back to the market. Whether it is a stock market or a housing market. We know that this is the case. That's another trade war on tariffs in the US and China.

There is another wave of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in circulation. We are also watching. That is, the government. Whether it is the Great Southern Plan or the Sunway at the beginning of the year, it is ongoing plans to promote the VOD.

These shape a lot of high-tech talents. With some talents. Flow. Our company's layout is also in these directions. So we have confidence in our products as well. And finally, because it also depends on the aging of the population.

The age of residential. Many apartments without elevators. Will be slowly eliminated. So we feel the rigid needs of the way. In the future will continue to exist. So the company is now generally.

And the Lord said unto him, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for this day is holy to the LORD, and holy to the LORD.
