<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it from the verbatim format to paragraph. First, I need to read the user's rules carefully to ensure that nothing is deleted, rewritten, or condensed. The user specifically emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to make sure that each timestamp corresponds to the correct sequence of sentences. Next, I check the verbatim content provided. It looks like a verbatim text of a speech or report that contains timestamps and the corresponding sentences. The user wants to group these sentences in logical order to form a coherent paragraph, but each original sentence must remain the same and cannot be modified or deleted.

First, I need to identify the corresponding sentences for each timestamp and identify the logical relationship between them. For example, the beginning part is the introduction of activities and guests, followed by the introduction of Mr. Yao's introduction and the background of the company. Then it is the company's organizational structure, production base, supply chain, etc., and finally the analysis of financial data and operations. I need to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are continuous in chronological order and logically consistent. For example, the parts of the company's history should be sorted in chronological order, from 1998 to 2013, to 2017, etc.

In addition, it is important to note that some sentences may have jumps after timestamps, such as [291. 44-293. 44] sudden jumps to [293. 44-295. 44], which may be due to errors or omissions in the original script. However, according to the user's request, the content cannot be modified, so it must be retained as it is necessary to process this jump in paragraphs to ensure that the order of the sentences is correct. When processing financial data and business analysis, it is necessary to ensure that the numbers and percentages are accurate, such as the amount and percentage of revenue reduction, gross profit margin changes, etc.

In summary, my steps are: 1. Identify the sentence corresponding to each timestamp; 2. Group the sentence according to the content logic; 3. Keep the original sentence unchanged and adjust the order to form paragraphs; 4. Check coherence and accuracy. To ensure that all requirements are met, especially the user emphasizes the "do not delete any sentence" and "not summarize".

First of all, I would like to thank Kaiqi Securities and Irtrust for their participation in the 2025 New World Economic Trends Forum. The management team of the company today is represented by the vice president of R&D, the vice president of R&D, and the deputy director of business, Mr. Tsai Wuchang.

After years of development, after the restructuring of the group in 2013, the group established the world's largest e-sports dissemination company, Dong Li Technology Co., Ltd. The company's main products are the low-suction DC brushless cooling fan, which is now the global PC e-sports dissipation fan supplier, from design and manufacture to sales. In recent years, it has also been developing a variety of low-suction products, such as hotel mirrors, car power supply and control, smart home appliances, and Telcom, new energy equipment and other related fields. What are the three projects mentioned above? In 1998, we set up new energy technology, more than 27 years.

In the past, we had different offices in Taipei office, which was set up in 2022 in the Central and Far East Four Seasons Square, and in December, we also completed the relocation of the factory area of the same building. We also purchased the 15th floor of the same building in September 2024. This page provides you with a brief description of the structure of power technology, which is the main body of Kaiman company is the power technology, which is currently the capital of NT$3.79 billion, which has two operating companies in China, which are Samoia, the power of Dongguan and Tailijiang.

In fact, from the perspective of production management, the difference between South China and East China is to let the two factories can support each other, which helps to diversify production risk, such as the energy consumption of the previous mainland China, as well as the repeated COVID-19 outbreak, Jiangxi factory has been able to undertake the production capacity of the Dongguan factory, so we can take the overall shipment, so we can take the production and distribution method. That in the supply chain, in the upstream and downstream of the supply chain, the dispersion finished products of KONE technology is located in the re-routine, can see the icon of the main building plant, the upstream of the raw materials are like the upper liquid and the tin plate, and the metal parts of the coil, the combination of the two collective electronic components of the PCVA circuit board, the electronic parts of the printing board, and the electronic parts of the printing board, and the electronic parts of the production of the product of the fan, then the product, and then the media to the middle channel sales. 5%, the main difference is because the relevant power supply and CPU cooler is increased, so compared to the same period of time this part is an increase of 3.5%, the rest of the difference is not big, like the supply chain is increased by 1.4%, the network communication is reduced by 0.4%, the other with the car category is reduced by 1%, the sales show of that small box product, so this part is not limited, but in general, there is not a significant difference.

The following paragraph type transcripts after rescheduling:. With the increase in R&D costs, the decrease in management costs is mainly reduced by an unlimited number of batches. Then the increase in R&D costs is mainly in the cost of labor and depreciation, and the increase in costs of related consumables.

The net profit in the last 24 years is $1.8 billion, which is the same as the month. Then the last EPS is $3.2 billion, which is the same as the same as the same period. The interest rate is reduced, about $1.9 billion. In the part of the consolidated balance sheet, we can see that the total asset is 3 billion, the total liability is 10.6 billion, and the total equity is 19.4 billion.

This part is due in the second half of the 24-year period, which is lower than the 23-year period. Therefore, the corresponding balance of the receivables is also reduced relatively. The other portion of the receivables is mainly due to the 53.38 million yuan, and the other processing fee, which is another additional fee payable. If we take this important financial indicator as a whole, we can see that the debt ratio is 35.41%. So this part is called the 29.19 increase in the third quarter, but compared to the same period, it is a slight increase of 2.43%.

The weekly turnover rate of inventory is slightly increased from 4.6 to 4.14 in the same period. Then the weekly turnover rate of receivables is slightly lower from 2.12 compared to the same period. However, in general, a structure of finance is a good situation. In the part of the consolidated flow table, we can see that the business activity is close to flow into 286 billion yuan, then the same period of time is 1.1 billion yuan. Then the investment activity is close to flow is 33 billion yuan, which just mentioned is the purchase of 15 floors and its related pre-paid equipment.

So, if we look at one of the financial data of these years, the first part of the revenue is 20 years of revenue is 15.7 billion yuan, then 22 years is 18.391 and 16.5.8 billion yuan respectively. So 23 years and 24 years due to global economic fatigue and then the weakening of terminal consumption, so 23 years 24 years of revenue is 13.8.2 billion yuan and 12.6.2 billion yuan respectively. So the portion of gross profit, 20 to 23 years is 5.6.9 billion yuan, as mentioned above, because of the global economic fatigue, so 23 years fell to 3.9 billion yuan.

The 21-year period is affected by the raw material plant, so it is 32 years to maintain the same level, then 23 years because of a weakening of terminal consumption, which affects revenue and gross profit margin. This part is down to 28% and 27% respectively. The net profit margin of 20 to 22 years is 1.6.3 billion yuan 2.2.5 billion, then 23 years and 24 years of revenue are 1.18 billion yuan. Then the EPS part, in 20 to 22 years was 5.66 yuan 6.83 yuan and 6.9 yuan, those 23 to 24 years because of the decrease in revenue, the overall profit, then the EPS is 3.10 yuan and 3.2 billion yuan. Then the dividend distribution, see this chart.

So in terms of competitive advantage, this part is to mention a vertical added value of power technology, because we are from the design of the product, we from plastic molding, wire processing, motor processing, we can make vertically integrated production, and master the key resources. So from the quality of the product, we can provide customers with a full range of cooling technology, and application solutions, then we can directly develop the product design stage, is the use of technological innovation and the design of new materials for application. In a limited space to play a high efficiency of cooling. So in terms of public production, our products are vertically integrated in the field, so the exchange of control is also high, you can control the quality.

So, we can greatly shorten the development lead and the production process of the product. Then, with a rapid change in the characteristics of the electronics industry, to improve the satisfaction and competitiveness of the customer. As previously explained, we are a vertically integrated production method, mastering the key resources, to ensure the product quality, shorten the delivery time, from the design to the opening time, and in fact, about 1.5 to 2 months.

So how to reduce the ability to reduce the process, speed up the conversion efficiency, improve the throughput rate with rapid and accurate inspection, and then improve the overall production quality, this part is a key process. Therefore, we are constantly optimizing the related process, as well as integrating the machine tools, improving the equipment semi-automatic and automated.

Other related, including fan automation main equipment, fan electrical testing equipment, and production line burner equipment. Our R&D team, actually there are a lot of equipment.

In fact, the R&D team has a number of R&D strength. In fact, the design of the graphics fan is futile, and it must be closely cooperated with the customer, and in the design to add speciality and differentiation. We in Taipei laboratory's MARR equipment, CNC machine, 3D link and dynamic audio cold machine. The part of the CNC machine is mainly for experimental test samples, we use the more rigid ABS material to adjust, so that the fan can do a stable test at higher temperatures.

In fact, in the design process, there will be a lot of places to overcome, and the design agency will have some challenges, so in the production time need to heat test the actual two tests, in order to achieve the most formal test effect. Summary, we in the research and development case, in fact, master a key technology, and a core value. The key is precision and effect, so the R&D team in the design phase, the introduction of computer design software and hardware, scientific measurement and proportional simulation, choose the most suitable component to improve the efficiency of the cooling fan, in line with the customer's requirements.

So we also have a number of R&D technologies in this section, 167 in Taiwan, 131 in mainland China, and patent applications in Japan at the same time. Market development, first of all, the development of the hotel into the market, because the part we observe, first of all, the PC market continues to increase. Before Neuron was a game cuisine, analysis company carried out a 7.30,000 players, as well as 10,000 game data to test, speculated that the number of players in the global PC in 2024 could reach 90.08 billion, compared to the 23.735 billion is a file growth, so it can show that the PC market is continuously expanding, but also exceeds the number of players in the home console.

In addition, we can see the evolution of the e-sports market, with the continuous development of 5G AI VR related technology, so the e-sports industry is more innovative opportunities, these technologies will actually bring more experience in the e-sports competition and the high requirements of the competition, so the development of the relevant e-sports market is constantly upgrading, so the overall e-sports industry is still exploring a diversified model, such as the e-sports live-streaming, e-sports peripheral product development, these new business models can bring a new bright future for the e-sports industry, but also promote the sustainable development of the e-sports industry. In the market evolution, the first to mention of the official introduction of the NVIDIA 50 series, will promote the demand for the e-sports PC, once again the new 50 series of graphics card, now launched, the market will feel that this launch is very advantage, because as a two major product updates, and the 3A big buy, the overall in the 45 3A games in 2025, so will be launched in 2025.

In addition, we can distinguish between the high-speed development of AI and HPC in the field of heat dissipation solutions. In fact, we can see that the market demand for heat dissipation is increasing, such as cloud service providers, data center layout, so computing demand is increasing, the consumption of heat dissipation is increasing, the heat dissipation of heat dissipation is increasing, and the demand for heat dissipation products is increasing. On the right side, we can see that a lot of innovative applications in the heat dissipation industry, such as computer graphics cards, electric vehicles, equipment servers, and heat dissipation needs.

In the application of automotive fans, here I would like to mention that the traditional boyfriend car is the engine, and the electric box traditional mechanical parts are the main, which is related to the rise of electric vehicles, the key technology, such as batteries, self-driving, logic technology, and even the car play, related to the generation of technological changes, but also affect the supply chain composition, East Low-tech also continue to develop the market.

The application of automotive fans is divided into four parts: front, front control, in-vehicle application, rear system. The front system consists mainly of LEDs, headlights, as well as water cooling, car battery control system. The front control consists of auto-pilot system, communication, entertainment, air conditioning. Part of the in-vehicle application is rear air conditioning, seat fan, stereo, amplifier.

The rear part of the system is like a battery cooling fan. The front presentation is an overview of power technology's operations in 2024. In addition to its operational efforts, power technology is also committed to sustainable investment. In the sustainable environment, we also have set up photovoltaic power generation facilities in Jiangxi plant, and solar energy can be converted to electricity to achieve a carbon reduction benefit.

We expect to upload a 2024 sustainability report in August. In the social responsibility section, we participate in the activities of the Animal Control Taiwan Business Investment Association, and also contribute to the Danjiang University's annual fundraising fund, since 108 years to the present, and also the Danjiang Alumni Association. In addition, we also participate in the sustainable development activities of our customers, participate in the joint venture about hand washing and maintaining the ocean. Finally, in the corporate governance section, the development of the sustainability report editing method, the 15 Code of Social Responsibility, and the 15 Code of Corporate Governance, strengthen the management of sustainable order, and protect the rights and interests of shareholders.

Thank you for listening to us.
