<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim that converts it from a verbatim format to a paragraph. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be kept as normal, just adjust the structure. Next, I will read the verbatim fragments provided, pay attention to each timestamped paragraph, and my task is to consolidate these sentences into consecutive paragraphs while maintaining the original sequence and content.

For example, some sentences may be disconnected due to the splitting of timestamps, but the actual presentation is continuous. For example, the user mentioned that "the consumer device and consumer here about 29%" followed by "the part of the phone is about 5%", and these two words may belong to the same paragraph, discussing the performance of different products, so it is necessary to merge.

For example, the greetings and introductions of the opening part should be merged into a paragraph, followed by the introduction of the operating team, and then the meeting process, and finally the specific financial data and product performance analysis. Each paragraph should be carried out around a topic, such as overall performance, performance of each product category, quarterly changes, etc. It is also important to pay attention to the correct use of the punctuation and format, to ensure that there are appropriate line breaks between paragraphs, separated by space between sentences, and kept readable. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences or timestamp errors to ensure that all content is properly converted.

Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph-by-word transcription to confirm that there is no missing content, all sentences are arranged in the original order, and paragraphs are logically separated. To ensure that the user's requirements are fully met, that is, not deleting any content, keeping the original intention, and improving readability. </think> Below is the compiled paragraph-by-text transcription (fully retaining all the original content, adjusting only layout and punctuation):

First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team of United Power International, where the Vice President of the General Assembly of the General Assembly and the Vice President of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the United Power International, and the Vice President of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the United Power International, and the Vice President of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the General Assembly of the United Power.

This year, in the last 24 years, in fact, what we saw in the last four quarters is about 10 billion, more than 10 billion. That is the whole year, from 2001 to so far, what we see in fact, is a year-on-year growth. From 2001 to 2024, the whole compound growth is about 9%, 9% of the situation.

So the price of clean and green products is 10% if it compares with the constant recurrence. If it compares with the constant recurrence, especially lamb bolts. That is, if the technology I want to say, and the software, if it says the link, you can say it is the same, but not the same.

In addition, the consumer goods device and consumer here about 29%, and the mobile phone part about 5%. Last year, I think it was obvious that we saw the entire commercial performance has exceeded the consumer products. This article we look at the whole quarter of the whole year the different categories of products. In fact, in the first quarter of the year, in addition to the decline of about 9%, in fact, the second quarter has a very good growth.

So, the mobile phone part, in fact, in the last year we saw the growth of a relatively high in addition to the third quarter, the first half is about 40 percent, the fourth quarter is more than 20% of the growth. This growth is mainly due to our Indonesia, Indonesia we have a new Chinese brand, so it is said that this is a very large contribution on the performance. Then again, ecocondak side of the story, ecocondak side of the story, mainly from the first quarter, the first quarter to the 15% growth, the second quarter to the third quarter, about a relatively normal growth is about 6% growth, about 6% and 8%.

However, from the whole of its performance or to maintain more than 300 billion, this is probably a relatively large difference, so about this is probably a relatively large difference, so about the fact that it is considered a relatively large difference, so about this is probably a relatively normal situation. The main growth, 9% of the year is mainly from the first quarter, the first quarter of the year there is a growth rate of up to 52%. Similarly, we see that the whole year of a situation, we see the whole enterprise, in fact, every year is a very solid growth.

In the past 10 years, in fact, we have been in the enterprise, enterprise solution and this SMA here, roughly 50 billion. This growth of the device is about 50 billion. This growth of the device is about 50 billion, compared with the consumer's speaking is about 20 billion. That is, it is almost equal to the mobile device, about 20 billion in recent years, it is more than 20 billion, in a situation like 20 billion. The whole enterprise solution here, this year, about 10% growth, the main growth of the data center, like server, about 37% of the year, is about 22% of the growth of the device.

The whole enterprise I think all types of products are actually growing, the main growth is server and storage device.

This year, I believe that after the first half of the year, the digital transformation of the entire business community, especially I want to see this kind of solution application. In fact, some of the applications are more mature, so I want to see this year, I want to see this year, the whole enterprise solution should still be able to say that the growth of the past. That Device and Cosmo, in fact, in recent years, it seems to be relatively poor compared to the last year, especially in the last year, the whole Cosmos market is really very bad.

This is not the case, but it is not the case that this is the case. In fact, I believe that this year, I want to say that this year, I want the whole AI phone in the high-end AI, this year, the market would say that recovery will recover this way. In fact, I think that this year, I want to lay down here, I think there is a very good growth, so the whole thing is mainly because in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the whole is said that the whole thing is very positive, so let the performance in this area of SMI has a relatively large growth, that this year, compared to this year, I think that this year, it is not the same thing as the next year, this year, but the next year, is a relatively challenging part of the next year. In Indonesia, I think the whole of last year's words, whether it's commercial its three categories of products are to maintain a very good growth, then look at Taiwan part of the relative I want to last year compared to the region can perform the least ideal growth of an undesirable area, about 8% of which we also see that it is almost every quarter, that it maintains a recession of 8%.

But the same thing happens in Taiwan, but the same thing in Taiwan, the most important thing is that it comes from the home market, especially the esports and components part, which we see is actually a kind of growth that is good for the commercial market. Then it is said that part of Hong Kong is almost equal to the flat recession of 1% of the side we see is that the main thing we see is that there is a relatively large recession in the second quarter of last year, and the second half of the year is that it maintains a state of balance.

It is likely that there are about 7 percent growth, Thailand is a better growth, about 15 percent, Vietnam is a slight growth, about about three percent growth. At present, the whole is said to be a distribution of a variety of products, basically said that IT products enterprise and device and consumer, about the commercial and household contributions about 31 percent, that is, the entire group, about 60 percent comes from IT products, the other is 20 percent, then the semiconductor is about 18 percent, so basically, I want to say the whole word in all categories, in fact, a balance, that the whole group. This is what we see is the whole of India in the Middle East Thailand, with this Vietnam's performance, that from this side of India, we see that it is always a very large growth, that last year was about 1800 billion, the Middle East part has been in fact, has always maintained a very good growth, that last year is the relative word, is the balance of the performance, that last year the main word is that this, Saudi Arabia, there is a relatively large impact, so that the whole European performance is generally flat, the whole performance of the whole speech is about 1600, 186 billion such. That said last year was also very good, there are probably 15 percent growth, that last year is probably about 40 billion, 392 million, that Vietnam's speech is a relatively large growth, after 2324, then 23 is actually a small growth, the whole Vietnam market, the whole market in the whole of the whole of the 22 years, what is a total of the same year, and so much more than that is not only a few of the most recent growth in Vietnam.

This is probably the whole of our 2024, that is, the whole of the individual categories products with a product of a product of a product of a product of a product of a particular category. Next we look at the whole income, the whole of the financial report I want to go to last year, last year the whole of the whole of the whole is said to be the whole of this profit, the profit of the words increased by 26% to 92 million, then the whole of the whole of the word is said to be a growth in the Ramiel part of the Maori part, the whole of the whole year is about 4.38%, the fourth quarter last year is almost 4.7%, so the fourth quarter is actually from Maori, in fact is a new high, that the whole year is about 1.8 billion, it is a new high. 7% growth, but in the fourth quarter, it was nearly 5 billion, 4.67 billion such.

In fact, YOY's growth is like 26%. That's part of the fee. That's part of the net interest. Last year, it was also a significant decrease. That's about 8 billion.

That's the same thing. I think the fourth quarter of last year is about 1.8 billion. 1.8 billion is also a big reduction. So the whole PPT is actually up to 123 billion. The PPT rate is up to 2.9%.

That was the fourth quarter of last year. In fact, the total PPT rate was 3.3%. It was probably a growth of 2.3%. It was a growth of 2.3%. It was a growth of 2.3%.

That year was 26% year-on-year. The whole year-on-year story. The story of the whole earlys per share was about 5.5. 5 pieces of 5 hairs2. That's what I'm going to say this year.

I think we should be able to keep improving. That cost is the same. I think we will keep talking about this downward trend. And I think I'm going to keep talking about the whole JV income story. Last year, it was only 7% growth.

That we believe that a growth in this year should be better than last year. That is the same word as in interest. Net interest fees above. Net interest fees. We really feel we have room. We can continue to fall.

This is how we see the whole working capital. That was the word of the whole working capital last year. It was really good. The word of the whole net over day came. The word of the fourth quarter came to be 69 days.

We can see it. In fact, the AR is probably holding control. But then there was a big drop in the history here. All the way through last year's fourth quarter. That's when it came to 36 days.

In fact, the whole second half of last year was about 37 days. Then it was about 36 days. The whole working capital. In fact, in the fourth quarter of last year. It was probably less than 90 billion. The whole balance sheet here.

I think the whole thing is about debt ratio. That's about 65. Then this net debt followed equity was last quarter last year. It was about 68%. The net value was about 46.2 yuan. That's all about some of the indicators in finance.

In fact, the opposite of the word is only a sound health. Then we have to recap the whole last year performance. That last year performance I wanted to say this whole. The Rabbit is a new high. The margin is also a new high.

Whether it is the amount or ratio is a new high in history. JP income here is about 7% growth. So the whole PVD is about 7% growth. PAT is about 26% growth. The whole ROE is about 13%.

It seems to be more than 75 days. In contrast to what I said last year, it was 23 years ago. That was 11 days down the road. That free cash flow was about $177 billion last year. That's what I wanted to see as a whole.

In fact, in the past 6 years, we have all been in a part of the insurance interest rate. We are probably more than 4, 2, 4, 2, and so on.

We are all about 2. 0. 2. 0. That's why we see the whole OPI story. In fact, in the past five years. We also stand strong is more than 2%. 2. 35 2. 35 Such.

That's the whole lame income and PAT ratio. That's what I said last year. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money.

That's what we see. Actually, I'd like to see an increase in profits except for a profit. In fact, we've been talking about our net worth here for 10 years, and we've been talking about compound growth as well.

That is to say, the whole dividend. That is, our payout ratio. That 2024 is what I want to see on the board of directors of the day before. It has been resolved that the whole year is a cash profit of $4 per share. That is, the whole payout ratio is coming.

72 such percent. So here you can see it too. In fact, we have a payout ratio over the years. We are probably more than that. 60 times 70 such 70 such a thing. Of course, there are special reasons for several years.

We have less than 50. But I think we have a few years to come to 80. 80 100 like this. In fact, I think this is probably the whole picture. The whole dividend some of the payout. Some of the past numbers are for your reference.

This is our reward, and this is our reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward, and this is the reward.

It is a low risk industry. So we are talking about that risk factor. We're about 10.7. That's the whole story. I think we're talking about the entire government.

This is a web-based business search of the parent company. Then I think we will start following this process again. Do some of the research of the subsidiary company. But from the whole parent company here. What we see is what we see for two years in a row.

Our carbon emissions are expected to drop by more than 10%, and that's where we are.

In addition, we also said that pricing is the same thing. 2023. One goal of our entire carbon emissions. As opposed to this 20. We will decrease by 25% in 23 years. That's what I set for now.

That's my report for today. **NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:**NOTE:****NOTE:**NOTE:**
