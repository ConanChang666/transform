[5. 00-18. 00] For Q4 by 2024, our total utilization is more than 60%, the total cost is more than 30%, and the total cost is more than 30 percent. [18. 00-31. 00] The total cost is 80 yuan, and Q1's 2025, we expect our traffic to be average. [31. 00-40. 00] We expect the average price of mixed sales to fall to a half-digit score.

[40. 00-47. 00] Then, because we had predicted the impact of the forecasts in January, [47. 00-48. 00] We expect our earnings to fall to a half-digit score, [48. 00-62. 00] cover earthquake impact loss from the insurance claims, [62. 00-64. 00] Sometimes down the line, [64. 00-73. 00] As far as being responsible for Q1 2025 will be about 70%, [73. 00-77. 00] and then as far as KPEX budget for 2025, [77. 00-78. 00] it is really, [78. 00-81. 00. 00. 00] From Q&A, we can continue. [84. 00-86. 00] Thank David. 00-88. 00JP, I am Morgan.

[88. 00-90. 00] I have a few questions about your question. [90. 00-95. 00] The first question is about your profit guidance for the first quarter. [95. 00-102. 00] What changes do you have about profit guidance for the future? [102. 00-106. 00] We do not expect any change in profit guidance. [106. 00-112. 00] We were before October 2024.

[112. 00-115. 00] On the phone in October 2021. [115. 00-119. 00] We proposed a price adjustment on the front line. [119. 00-125. 00] We also expected any changes to the profit guidance of Q1 2025. [125. 00-129. 00] Also, in the second quarter of October 2021. [129. 00-132. 00] Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting Forecasting. [132. 00-136. 00] fy der [136. 00-138. 00] in 21st.

[138. 00-142. 00] We count again about 9%. [142. 00-147. 12] For protection. [147. 12-152. 00] Is that 8%? [152. 00-160. 00] We also pay attention. [160. 00-161. 02] A small sign of time.

[161. 02-162. 00] is the high present of 8% per 1% of the IPA. [162. 00-168. 00] Finally, we will make a full automatic transition to the FAB. [168. 00-183. 00] Understand. I would like to ask you why ASP and diplomacy conversion rates continue to decline in 2024 in your fourth quarter.

[183. 00-190. 00] Yes, in the fourth quarter, our total value was about 30. 3%. [190. 00-200. 00] And the reason is that our total value is high and our products are less mixed. [200. 00-206. 00] This resulted in a decrease in the total value of 2024. [206. 00-212. 00] This is really the way our last guide provided. [212. 00-213. 00] Good. [213. 00-215. 00] Good, understood.

[215. 00-227. 00] My next question is about the recent increase in Taiwan's shipping rates. How do you plan to act on these risks? [227. 00-235. 00] Yes, we are expected to be at risk, such as increased shipping rates, as well as some high-value pressure. [235. 00-242. 00] We will continue to take a lot of initiatives to avoid some of these problems. [242. 00-249. 00] trollsи. google. com [249. 00-258. 00] There are eight types of well-crafted videos that we will have 86 00 motivations and ogl리 ItsAbundancy.

[258. 00-259. 00] Rice. [259. 00-264. 00] Get Wikileaks. [264. 00-266. 00] is the first consultant analyze. [266. 00-267. 00] Three stories. [267. 00-268. 00] Why do I want to know. [268. 00-269. 00] What are the classes!

[269. 00-270. 00] Because the Washington agenda at that time determined the answer to fat Zach T Operation 112. [270. 00-270. 92] vs. aders. [270. 92-271. 90] Yes. [271. 90-276. 90] These programs will want to get closer to some of the premise we talked about.

[276. 90-282. 90] and keep our long-term financial health. [282. 90-284. 90] OK. [289. 90-293. 90] Thank you for your recommendation. [293. 90-299. 90] Now I would like to conduct a 2025 appearance guide. [299. 90-304. 90] Your lemme ask you what's the big target with 2025 Fa. [304. 90-316. 90] Domain engineering is seeking a 10% increase in 2025.

[316. 90-318. 90] Quality is incompatible with the necessity of AI. [318. 90-323. 90] and utilis technology möjlig theft increased. [323. 90-325. 90] This is why Foundation's skills. [324. 00-325. 90] New types of external cinco digging Kag system. [325. 90-328. 90] May have the greatest added value. [328. 90-329. 52] So będzie is better.

[329. 52-329. 90] Works with Pa have a big impact. [329. 90-333. 90] Includes mobile phone and mobile phone spare parts and mobile phone spare parts. [336. 54-344. 30] What is Foundry's 2025 market forecast and 2025 is the market forecast for UMC10. [345. 58-352. 06] We expect that by 2025 the Foundry market will be high. [35. 06-358. 22] We see the UMC's acceptable market as we see it. [358. 94-365. 34]

[365. 98-372. 70] Expected to be slightly increased, we see half of the page growth in mobile phone spare parts and mobile phone spare parts. [372. 70-381. 98] These factors will become the main guide for low single-digit growth and maturity. [382. 06-388. 42] We believe that this information is supplied to the main body without the need to connect the population numbers, and we are with it. [388. 42-392. 38] The main market in China is manufactured in several 쪽rendo, specifically published and so on, of course we have not. [392. 38-396. 60] In participation in the above information, our two groups are public, retr. [397. 94-402. 94] Foundry's technical reproduction, дилe is in Renji consumption with i ich OAE,

[403. 68-407. 94] Their professional expectations are coming to an end, and I have no point at all. [408. 86-411. 26] So I don't have to mention the various performance projects. [412. 06-417. 06] The supply is still pretty much higher than the automatic currency and industry sector. [417. 06-419. 06] I think the market pays more attention to the price. [425. 06-431. 06] What are the risks of ASP markets in the coming year, at the risk of price?

[431. 06-437. 06] Our way of pricing remains the same for ASP. [437. 06-442. 06] We respect the market price. [442. 06-446. 06] At the beginning of the year, price change will be a change. [446. 06-453. 06] The price view will be similar to that in 2024. [452. 06-456. 06] We continue to enhance our product stock.

[456. 06-459. 06] We expect 28-22nm revenue. [459. 06-466. 06] will represent 30% high broad growth and 22nm expenses. [466. 06-467. 00] Thank you. [467. 06-469. 06] is understood. [469. 06-476. 06] Is the highest UMC in the first quarter of 2025, based on market revenue and fees?

[476. 06-484. 06] Our Q1 2025 instructions are obviously better than the season. [484. 06-487. 06] Short-term vision is still less lacking. [487. 06-490. 06] Mainly because it is not based on the factors. [490. 06-492. 06] For example, in the United States. [492. 06-496. 06] We do hope that Q2 will gradually grow. [496. 06-501. 06] We determine our 22nm product line.

[501. 06-503. 06] will be in production. [503. 06-507. 06] and will reach UMC's growth in the second quarter of 2025. [507. 06-510. 06] We expect to grow in 2025. [510. 06-513. 06] I understand. [513.0-06-518. 06] I think the Foundry industry is relatively competitive. [518. 06-521. 06] is similar to the current cost of the Foundry industry.

[521. 06-524. 06] How to make UMC's plans available in mid 2025. [524. 06-526. 06] More successful. [526. 06-529. 06] What special methods do you have available? [529. 06-531. 06] We are in 2025.

[531. 06-533. 06] is in the mature growth with the Foundry industry. [533. 06-535. 06] Mid 2025. [535. 06-537. 06] We are in the mature growth with the Foundry industry. [537. 06-439. 06] is different. [539. 06-541. 06] is in the semiconductor industry. [541. 06-543. 06] Our plan is unforeseen.

[543. 06-546. 06] Such a plan. [546. 06-549. 06] led to supply chain resistance. [549. 06-551. 06] also created. [551. 06-553. 06] The supply capacity of the industry. [553. 06-555. 06] The supply capacity of the industry. [555. 06-557. 06] is stronger.

[557. 06-559. 06] is subject to supply chain in the industry. [559. 06-561. 06] is resistant. [561. 06-563. 06] UMC is one. [563. 06-565. 06] is able to support the FAB industry around the world. [565. 06-567. 06] Foundry industry. [567. 06-569. 06] We were many years ago.

[569. 06-571. 06] is also expected. [571. 06-573. 06] Requires a variety of. [573. 06-575. 06] Design method. [575. 06-577. 06] And we think. [577. 06-579. 06] Our technical analysis. [579. 06-581. 06] is to be strengthened.

[581. 06-583. 06] Our technical analysis. [583. 06-585. 06] Our price plan. [585. 06-587. 06] Compared to the previous years. [587. 06-589. 06] Our price analysis. [589. 06-591. 06] is also increasing. [591. 06-593. 06] UMC's diversified design.

[593. 06-595. 06] and competition technology provided. [595. 06-597. 06] will separate our colleagues. [597. 06-599. 06] and colleagues. [599. 06-601. 06] OK, clear. [601. 06-603. 06] I think China's competition. [603. 06-605. 06] and competitors.

[605. 06-607. 06] such as SMIC, Huahong. [607. 06-609. 06] and so on. [609. 06-611. 06] is on the supply chain. [611. 06-613. 06] What is there to do. [613. 06-615. 06] For Chinese competitors. [615. 06-617. 06] For UMC.

[617. 06-619. 06] Future growth and harmony. [619. 06-621. 06] Forward technology.

The most important core of UMC is 22 and 28 nm technology at this time. Our customers believe that UMC's main position is 22 nm advanced batteries and the same market that reached them. At present, we expect 22 nm technology to be a strong line and we are expanding our 22 nm special technologies such as 22 nm advanced batteries, 22 nm wireless batteries and RAM.

We are also going to bring the result to the footproof as well as Method strings, which is what we can achieve in our reachable market, and we have a lot of development in our circulation. For example, we expect our 12nm partnership to provide technological advancement and expand the high-growth market. Our early-stage plans with key customers have shown a strong interest in our production plans.

In addition, we are also planning to offer high-level growth apps to achieve high-growth apps. Our growth opportunities lie in the mix of current stock growth and growth of our reachable markets. Well, thank you for telling us about your growth schedule. Can I know more about your 2025 funding? Yes.

Our funds for 2025 are $1.8 billion. This will include the Singapore 12i Phase 3Fab building, as well as the design of clean houses. In addition, we have also completed the growth of 12AP6 and 12X in 2020.

In addition, the growth of our 12AP6 and 12X in 2025. In addition, we have also completed the growth of 12AP6 and 12X in 2020. Well, I think the final question is about your 8-foot business update, as well as the 12-foot business update. I think the final question is about your 8-foot business update, as well as the 12-foot business update.

Yes, the growth of 12-foot business, Wafer conveyor and Q1 2025 will decrease slightly, so the 12-foot business Wafer conveyor and Q1 2025 will decrease slightly, due to the long-term changes in transmission size and other improvements in electric horse conveying. However, we expect that the test development of 22 and 28-nm skill cars will continue to grow, mainly due to Wi-Fi, pre-signal, OLED display vehicle IC, NET, and some network applications. We continue to enhance our product share of 22 and 28nm revenue will represent a 30% higher range, 22nm increase in paper power, as we see gradual improvements in 8-foot production, 8-foot usage will rise in 2025, now, you know, our 8-foot purchase price is below the company average, but we have demonstrated our ongoing efforts to make business opportunities with 8-foot BCD and high-power solutions, thank you David, I think that we can make this data.
