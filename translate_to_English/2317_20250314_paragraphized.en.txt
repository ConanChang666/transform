**2024**. **2025 Full Year Outlook**. Last November, we mentioned that 2025 was a year of optimism. While there have been slight changes in US tariff policies, geopolitical risks, and global monetary policy over the past few months, we still expect strong growth throughout the year.

In addition to AI, the increase in demand for data processing and storage, and the increase in product quality, as well as the increase in product quality, the increase in product quality, as well as the increase in product quality, the increase in product quality, as well as the increase in product quality, are expected to grow significantly in general servers.

In the end of the computer terminal product, due to multiple product line updates, it is expected that more product line updates will be made to the basis of the product line updates, and this year there will be a slight decline. Finally, in the original and other, we continue to expand the supply of components on ICT products, coupled with the continued growth of the electric vehicle business, which is expected to have a strong growth this year.

In the first quarter of the year, we expect steady cash flow to the company every year, but in the current region, the demand for consumer electronics and terminal products is expected to be relatively stable. However, in the case of more variables such as regional politics, tariffs, etc., the manufacturing side will be facing significant growth, and the demand side may be affected, and the demand side will be affected. To cope with these changes, we will be closely with customers and use our global layout to make timely adjustments. In the long run, we expect that as the application of edge AI is becoming increasingly popular, there will be more and more personal device upgrades.

AI server market conditions, in 2024 large-scale CSP and first-line brand factories, the demand for AI server sales has increased significantly, led to the AI server revenue growth of more than 150%, coupled with the rise of general server demand, the overall server revenue has reached 78%, as mentioned in the previous Law Car Club, 2025 is the year of AI, the demand for global AI computing infrastructure will continue to increase, and the capital expenditure of major CSP vendors this year will maintain strong growth in the first quarter.

In the second half of the year, we expect the North American version of Model C and Model B to be mass-produced, and the electric bus factory will expand our delivery on the electric bus after the completion of certification in the third quarter. In the battery section, our co-generation battery plant will be mass-produced in the first quarter, and will also meet the domestic customer's domestic goal of supplying electric bus battery packs.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the verbatim provided for the timestamp and pay attention to the timestamp and the content. Some sentences may have errors in the timestamp, such as [1091. 20-1098. 20] "We will have an average performance improvement of 30% to 50% of the on-line service.

For example, about software layout, smart manufacturing, smart cities, semiconductors, satellite communications, etc., each subject may need to be separated. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure the transition between paragraphs naturally. During the processing process, also pay attention to some possible translations or language errors, such as the Russian term "лчы" and "лыше", and the Chinese term "price", as well as mixed situations.

In addition, some sentences may be incomplete or chaotic, such as "50 years later, we are still in the car neiv and working with ambitious research", but the original sentence must remain unchanged. Finally, check whether the entire paragraph is smooth, meet the requirements of the user, make sure that there is no missing sentences, and each paragraph is correctly grouped. Once completed, read again to make sure that everything is properly converted without omissions or errors. </think> The following is a paragraph-based transcription of the finishing process (full of the original content, undeleted, rewritten or condensed): --- In the layout of the software, we will continue to work with the Middle East automaker to design and develop battery architectures to develop products related to the smart cabin.

In addition, we will continue to develop the EV software ecosystem and work with AI Agent to create a new ecosystem of software-defined cars. Next, we will be part of the intelligent manufacturing process. The Genesis platform project we have partnered with BCG has already achieved some results on the Manufacturing AI platform, including smart cooking based on AI and smart production.

In addition, in the application of intelligent robots, we will continue to develop applications for advanced automation technologies and standardize and virtualize our production plants. This will be more helpful for us to speed up the introduction of more robots for the event. We will be in the application of our production field. Finally, we will use the Omniverse server to produce and assemble digital warm-up plants. We will also show you the operation of GB200 after a virtual integration. Next, we will be part of the intelligent program.

In the near future, we will continue to expand our strategic partners, including local governments’ smart program solutions, and transportation companies’ application services on MaaS. In the near future, we will continue to promote an opportunity for cooperation at home and abroad, including in countries such as Mexico and Japan, and explore the needs of citizens, businesses and governments in different cities.

In addition, copper sea will also build the top-level platform in large-scale ways to lead domestic software manufacturers to develop application services. Next is the semiconductor part. The layout of the semiconductor on the AI Server has been gradually developed. With the cost advantage of power efficiency, the AI Server has been introduced. Synchronization has also begun to provide customers with 5-nm advanced process design services. The SIC and IGBT modules have also received 4 mass orders for commercial vehicles, electric buses, and light group applications.

We hope that in the next 5 to 10 years, we will be able to grow across the globe customers and actively participate in the development of sovereign communications galaxies. We will continue to strengthen our 6G layout through our BOL strategy and the advantages of our global supply chain. Next, we will bring the advantages accumulated in the ICT EV field to the new space supply chain. Our goal is to become the advantage of 6G sovereign communications by 2030.

After 50 years, we are still in Car neiv and working with ambitious research. O'right. We created a new AI-powered platform for the next generation of AI, Universe, and Digital Twins for the future of manufacturing.

In addition, in order to promote sustainable technology, we have partnered with ZetaByte to promote high-efficiency AI solutions. We will also present the results of the Copper Ocean Research Institute this week, the first edition of the FastBrain AI in Traditional Chinese. This model training uses NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and its training time takes about four weeks to complete, lower and more efficient. In the future, we plan to implement AI Big Language Models to enhance the data analytics efficiency of the three platforms.

Our own research and development results have also been published or published in top-level quantum computing seminars and internationally renowned journals. In terms of awards, we have been recognized by the National Invention and Creation Awards in the field of digital health. Among the top 100 competitive awards, we have also been ranked first in other electronics fields. We have also been awarded the Keruiwean 100 Innovation Institute Awards for 8 consecutive years, which also encourages us to constantly invest in research and development for innovation.

In addition, the second edition of the TELPGA Golf Tournament was successfully completed earlier this month, and we were honored to receive a sports promotion award for such an international-level event. In the IR Magazine Awards, we also received three awards related to investors. We also received a lot of recognition for our efforts to promote sustainability globally.

Thank you James. Next, we will go to the second stage of the meeting, and then we will report to you. The first question is to ask the Chairman to explain that this year's AI server revenue ratio will increase to at least 50%, and ask the Chairman to share with you some questions about the supply and demand of the AI server this year.

In the field of AI server, we have mastered the advantages of R&D digital manufacturing platform, vertical integration, customer relationship and global layout, from large CSP to first-line brand customers, covering the AI server market now the main buyers. At this stage of the order visibility is better than previously expected, whether it is existing products that are currently mass-producing climbs, or new products, new projects, we are investing a lot of R&D resources and capacity to meet our customers' needs, as GB200 mass-produced gradually matured.

**As the host:** and according to the current situation of customer orders, this year's AI server revenue will go up year by year, I believe that the total AI server revenue, this will account for more than 50% of our overall server revenue, thank the chairman. **As the second question about the global layout, according to the changes in Trump tariff policy, what adjustments have been made to the company's global layout strategy, what will be the future layout planning? **The chairman:** The United States is actually the first country in the overseas investment, we have entered the United States in 1985, we have started to expand into the United Kingdom in 1998, and we have entered the United States since 2004 into Mexico, we started in 2007, we have 24 countries in Vietnam, we have accumulated a lot of experience on the global layout, because of the last few years, because of the relationship, the supply chain diversity and resilience we have been working hard to build up capital expenditures in 2022, we will be more than the following the following the next year.

**CFO:** Due to the rapid development of the AI industry, the AI server is an important growth engine in the industry, and has the characteristics of high-price ratio. Therefore, we will actively strive for the relevant business opportunities, AI server and new product business, revenue will grow, there will have some impact on the operating gross profit margin, before the legal tax will share with you is the trading model, there will be a different degree, but the operating fee, we will continue to be cautious management, Hon Hai has the scale of operations and there is a competitive advantage in the integration, so the operating profit margin is still a positive contribution, we also understand investors hope, we can increase the profit margin, but because the AI performance is faster than expected, but also affect the performance of gross profit margin in the near future.

**Grace:** Chief Financial Officer James please start the Q&A session. The first question I would like to ask the chairman about GB200, because we understand at the beginning, many leaders face a variety of problems, how is the current progress? Because we just saw your guidance in the first quarter, AI Server should have more than 100% growth in the quarter, that is, whether this means that the problem we see now is within half of the time, it is within half of the time, now we see the AI Server's leadership facing the problem. **Grace:** The problem is already the problem. **CFO: **GB200, NVL72 is a system-level cabinet, the process of production, it involves a lot of integration, as the more and more production data we see, the situation is that we have seen at this stage has reached the relevant production standards, the project team will continue to improve the process, and the production will be stable, and we will continue to grow in the next quarters. **

** Moderator:** Thank you Grace, we are now open to online legal and media questions.

We are all concerned about the change of short-term orders. In fact, this position in this industry, our relationship with our customers is very long, as we mentioned earlier, we started to develop our products with our customers a long time ago, we are very confident in the product, especially in the performance of this Gb series of new products, we are very confident.

As for where the investment is located, capital expenditures in major countries will continue to increase to more than 20%, capital expenditures in major countries will continue to increase to more than 20%, capital expenditures in major countries will continue to increase to more than 20%, including mainland China, Taiwan, India, the United States, Southeast Asia, etc. Whether it is directly facing tariffs, or in response to tariff production plan adjustments, it is taking into account the needs of customers, and the costs associated with the cost will be discussed with customers to maintain the stability of our products. There is no such thing as a good idea. It is not a good idea to create a good idea. It is not a good idea to create a good idea. It is a good idea to create a good idea.

The original manufacturing service. To become a service of a platform. So from the service point of view of the platform. We will not only provide hardware, but also provide related software. But it is a platform.

So we made it to the end of the season, and we made it to the end of the season, and we made it to the end of the season, and we made it to the end of the season.

Have you heard of Payne? Can you please tell me. I'm the Chairman James. I'm Payne of TBBS. I have two questions here to ask. About the emergence of DeepSeek.

There are a lot of market views. That's what you want to ask from the manufacturer's point of view. DeepSeek's appearance. Does it affect customers?

The second question is. I saw the first one recently launched by Hon Hai. The English version of FoxBrain. Can't share it with us. Share its highlights. Thank you.

I'll start by talking about FoxBrain. There's a relationship with DeepSeek. It's actually DeepSeek inside it. It's some of the technology it uses. It's actually in this industry. It's actually in this industry in the past.

This industry is used by many people. For example, using the existing AI that has been formed. The model to train the new AI model. It is called distillation. It is just a fear of distillation in the past.

That is, distillation may not be legal. So we all did it. But don't dare to say. DeepSeek lets everyone have one thing in this regard. This is a big breakthrough. So now we all say it.

We do this. Our FoxBrain is also the same. Use similar methods. Use a few distillation. Then add us. This reasoning.

There is also a section in this Traditional Chinese. There are some further enhancements to this. Let's make this new model. In Traditional Chinese. There is reasoning. And on the mathematical model.

We have done a lot of good things, we have done a lot, we have done a lot, we have tested this test, this performance test, this one is above the radar chart.

You see in these aspects. It is a good performance. Then in the future we will make our FoxBrain. This will be open to this. This becomes an open source. A model.

We want to be able to use this model above. Yes. It does more in Traditional Chinese. Some of the applications have been developed. We also have three platforms in our group. This model is based on this model.

This is what we have to do with FoxBrain, its condition, its way to DeepSeek, and its effect.

It. Because of its technical method. Make a lot of original. Maybe there is no way to participate in the big round model.

It is like the sea, like the sea, and like the sea, we have this FoxBrain, which is supposed to take 100 pcs of H100. This is what we do.

continuous. continuous. pre-training and then some post-training. So you can train to. We just talked about that. A performance like that.

That's all. In the past it might not be easy. In the past I remember ours. This R&D team required more than 2000 pieces. So now we only use 100 pieces. That's a big difference.

That's why this is the case. It accelerates the reasoning. It's used in AI servers, so it was developed by the AI models in the past. Most of them are led by this large CSP.

That's getting more and more seen now. Multi-medium companies are starting to buy this AI server. To train their own models. That's what I think will drive this edge AI.

This new model includes AGI and ASI. It is still in development. It still requires a lot of computational power.

It may be possible. A practice similar to Deep-Seek. Let. This new model. Can be computed at the edge. Can play it.

So we see that the high-level AI server, that demand, it will continue to grow, it will continue to grow, and it won't.

Because of this, open source, this, the appearance of the related model, and was adversely affected.

The next question we asked Sanli's wisdom softly. Please. Mr. JAMS, I am the smart softness of Sanli's finance. Today I want to help the million shareholders to fight. The first thing I want to ask can not reveal at the moment.

This is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the wicked is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the righteous is the reward of the righteous, and the reward of the righteous is the reward of the righteous.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of each part of the structure and content. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite or condensate any sentence, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order and maintains the integrity of each sentence.

First of all, I will check the format of the original transcript. It looks like each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine the sentences arranged in chronological order into a coherent paragraph while retaining all the content. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, while others may belong to different conversations or themes that need to be properly segmented.

Similarly, questions about AI ASIC server and CSP requirements, as well as subsequent answers, need to be segmented. During the process, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the transition between paragraphs naturally does not miss any sentences. At the same time, to identify different participants in the conversation, such as "Goku" and "Azer" questions, as well as the answer section, correctly separate their speech.

In addition, the user mentioned the "important rule" cannot delete anything, so even if some sentences don't look coherent or duplicated, they must be retained. For example, when answering the CSP needs, there are multiple "uh" and duplicate sentences, which need to be retained in the final paragraph to maintain the original intention.

In addition, the space and punctuation in timestamps need to be preserved to ensure consistent with the original transcription. Finally, I read the entire finishing paragraph transcription, check whether all sentences are correctly arranged, no omissions or misalignments, and the separation between paragraphs is reasonable. Make sure that the sentence logic in each paragraph is coherent, while the overall structure is clear, and the user's requirements are met.

Yes Yeah OK" "My first question is that I want to understand how you think about AI ASIC servers because I think we are very good market share in GPU servers" "How do we know about AI ASIC servers because it feels like there's more demand to be more than the demand" "Shifting to ASICs within the AI,What is Honhai's presence and market share in this pace,And how do we see that change" "Second question is that much of the market in the CSP demand year,Obviously quite some time to go" "What do we have to say is that there is no problem with customers, Like Microsoft and others, Government or business groups, And things like that" "Good, Goku, let me try to answer your two questions during 2026 "About AI software, we work with most AI ASICs" "We are satisfied with the competition, we have a lot of competition, we have a lot of the same demand, we have a lot of the same demand, we have a better than that we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better choice, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better, we have a better Gb, that is, in the market I recently heard that the upstream Core in this reduction was not because the Gb200 shipped, and then I heard that the slow Brainwell will go to the SGS, then I think that the question is whether it is affecting the situation of Honghai in the second quarter, or that the company is not the problem, because the main company has produced these things, which is because most of the recent weeks in the market discussion about the issue of Gb200, about the Gb200 question is whether this is because his Dice size is relatively large, some changes on the Semal solution, and some changes on Power, this is the whole Gb question. "The second question is that we ask the company is about Trump's tariff issue, I think it has long been announced that the company should be Apple in Texas, whether it can ask the president about the tariff issue, and there is nothing further this in the next year the company in the U.S.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize these dispersed sentences into a consistent paragraph while retaining the original order and content.

This may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph, and then merging them together. First, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content. It looks like an executive is answering a Q&A session on company production status, tariff issues, collaboration with Apple, etc. Next, I need to group these answers by topic, such as the production status of Gb200, the impact of Cowas production reduction, GB300, tariff issues, iPhone business, etc.

Similarly, the part of the tariff question begins with [3660. 00-3667. 00], and ends with [3704. 00-3711. 00], and needs to be merged into a paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the structure of the Q&A section. The user's example, the questioner Angela's response needs to be properly segmented to ensure that the question and answer are not confused. For example, the question section starts with [377. 00-3773. 00], to [3825. 00-3826. 00], and the answer starts with [3827. 00-3830], to [3878. 00-3879. 00], which needs to be collated into paragraphs separately. During the process, there may be connection problems between some sentences, such as interval between timestamps, but the sentence content is continuous. For example, [356. 00-3564. 00-3568. 00] and [3564. 00] may be inserted in the middle may have other sentences that the same paragraphs, but may need to confirm whether the same paragraphs.

In addition, some sentences may be wrongly separated due to the interval between timestamps and need to be judged according to the content. It is also important to pay attention to the consistency of the punctuation and sentences. For example, some sentences may start with "that", which means taking the preface, need to ensure that these sentences are properly connected in paragraphs. At the same time, avoid using any formatting or markup to keep the paragraph structure of the plain text. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will again check whether any sentences are omitted to ensure that all content is converted correctly and the transition between paragraphs is natural.

The first question is about the production of the Gb200. As I mentioned earlier, this Gb200 is a very complex system, which requires a lot of data to be collected, and a lot of data to make this production smoother. After more than half a year of data collection, it is now seen that it has reached the standard of mass production. But because it is a complex system, so there are a lot of parts inside it, so the impact has become quite complex in terms of testing.

I don't think it's going to be a big problem for us in the coming quarters. So what does Cowas mean about this? That part is not clear, maybe it's going to be better to ask this with Cowas or ours with NVIDIA. That said, I think it's the issue with GB300, and I think it's the one that got our customers to answer that because they're better than us.

So we all know that when these plans are ripe, we all know that the issue above this tariff has always been a headache for our customers CEOs, and this is a problem that is very focused and concerned about. What will happen in the future? We now see the US government's attitude towards tariffs, and his practice, and I find it difficult to predict. So we can only look at this change and do what we can to do, which is our attitude to the Honghai.

But we are very confident about Apple, and I am sure that in this deep AI, they will be confident that there will be some of this. So we will continue to work with our customers to maintain this deep cooperation and will not change. Well, this is now 4:02, so we accept the last question.

I have two smaller questions to ask. The first is that we just mentioned that this AI should be fixed by more than half this year, and our 4% share. So I can ask first, can this weight give us an update in 2024? This is the first. The second question is more financially related, which is the company just mentioned before, should just mention that our AI should have a slightly diluted situation, but it should still be positive for OP Margin.

I may want to ask, this is the positive meaning of our company's average, for example, 3% down, is this OP margin level close to such a water level? That's my question to compare follow up. Thank you. The first question I'd like to answer first, the AI line of 2024 is about 4%, 40% to 42%.

Thank you very much. That's the impact of OPM on the entire OPM, as we have just talked about, it's probably a bit of a cohesive effect, these effects should make our OPM more than this year, compared with last year's ratio less than that, our prediction is probably this. Good, thank you very much. Thank you very much for your help. Thank you Andrea.

That's 4 o'clock in the morning, so I think you should have received a lot of answers and reminders. That's why our visit today will be open to this place, and we want to thank you for your participation. Thank you all.
