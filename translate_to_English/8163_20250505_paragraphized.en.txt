The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. The turnover fee is partly $9.46 billion. The QOQ part is reduced by about 9.5%. The YOY part is about 23 percent. The cost here is because Germany's M&A companies came in last quarter of last year. So the whole first quarter of this year is the same as the standard for the entire fee for the fourth quarter of last year.

The total decrease in QOQ is nearly doubled. The YOY part is an increase. The basic increase in business expenses here is the increase in some of their business expenses from the merger and acquisition companies.

QOQ is a recession of 86.5%. YOY is a recession of 95.4%. The net income part here is attributable to the parent company's consolidated net profit. For example, 59 million, which is some of the operating expenses of the merger and acquisition company.

The total turnover per share is $0.200 million. In the entire product portfolio, this quarter accounted for approximately 51% of the products around IT. The second part was about 36 percent of the green products. The entire original portion remained at about 13 percent. The revenue for the whole quarter was just mentioned because of the year-over-year impact of the whole quarter and a slight decline in the whole quarter.

However, the YOY part is about to grow by 7.3%. In the gross profit margin section, it was mentioned just because of the revenue, product or product portfolio of the entire business. The PayIT product portfolio is continuously optimized. There is a downside here, some of the effects of the gross profit of the green energy products. So it remains at 17.8%. The margin portion of the April income was improved to 0.6%.

The consolidated assets of the whole first quarter are not in the table, in the cash section, about $6.3 billion in the cash period of the securities, and about $6 billion in the stock section. The stock section is about 6.1 billion, and here it continues to de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-centralized.

There is a slight increase in part in KIT. That is because the growth momentum of the revenue of the entire PayIT is still there, in the first quarter and the second quarter. So after these two offsets, the actual inventory is still trending downward. The total debt ratio is about 58.6%. The proportion of shareholders' equity is about 41. 4%. $38.8.

This is mainly due to the recent global economic uncertainty of the entire country. Only the cash level and relatively healthy financial structure can be achieved to reduce the future economic uncertainty. The consolidated cash flow statement for the whole and the first quarter of this business activity is about 67 million cash flow. This is mainly because the profit of the industry in the first quarter has been slightly reduced.

That part of the cash flow in the investment activity is about 53 million. This is mainly due to capital expenditure, about 1.76 billion. The 1.76 billion is mainly due to some input from some machine equipment. That is to say, some automation equipment investment has some capacity expansion. But here is a little bit more cautious, so in the second quarter compared to the third quarter, the policy uncertainty of the entire Trump tariffs.

We are on a budget there, but I will keep a flexible one. That is to see where some of the tariffs are relatively clear, and then decide where the capital expenditure should be invested. Because in terms of size, we all have a layout. So in response to the overall uncertainty of the tariffs, we are more likely to bounce into a move. So this is to maintain a flexible change.

The cash flow of the entire financing activity is about 1.21 billion. The cash savings during this period is that the cash flow is increased by about 1.55 billion. So the whole focus here is that the entire capital expenditure will be slightly flexible in the incoming adjustment.

The other part is that the cash flow part of the entire cash flow is relatively safe and healthy. Here are some important financial indicators. The debt ratio is about 59%. The current ratio is 111%. The cash flow cycle is about 143 days. The ROE is about 0.7%.

The ROE is 0.2%. Here it looks like the debt ratio is basically still in a well-controlled water level. It can help maintain a relatively stable capital structure. The relatively high liquidity ratio can maintain a relatively stable short-term temporary capacity with liquidity.

The entire CCC is constantly improving. This means we are focusing on some AR, AP, or stock. This means we are focusing on some AR, AP, or stock. We will continue to make some better improvements for each location. Well, then this is the second part, and this is the conversion part of the performance.

I want to report to you all. Well, I want to share with you the progress of the investment. I want to share with you the next year and the outlook for the year ahead. Basically, the figures we have seen from our revenues over the past 24 years have benefited from our mergers and acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year. It seems that the momentum of this year's entire growth is as if the last law would report to you should be a state of growth.

The second is, of course, the situation of this ALT. This is largely changed from the impact of tariffs on this time. Because of this 90-day period, there are some exemptions from certain products. It seems that this growth momentum in the second quarter of this group IT is still from the current customer's orders. So we expect to see that this is a positive trend in the second quarter of the relative group IT.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's verbatim text and sort it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the user's rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I will analyze the verbatim fragments provided by the verbatim. Each entry has timestamps and content, and I need to merge these into paragraphs in logical order, while keeping the original order and content intact.

First of all, I will read through the whole transcription to identify different topics or points of discussion. For example, about the impact of emobility, the stock planning, the observation of Taipei and Europe, the impact of tariffs, the financial situation, the impact of Taiwan dollar appreciation, etc. Each topic may need to form a separate paragraph.

For example, on the part of inventory planning, sentences from 487. 66 to 520. 66 can be combined into a paragraph, as they discuss the same subject. Similarly, the impact of tariffs and the financial situation also need to be merged. It is important to note that some sentences may include a stutter or duplication of oralization, such as "that basically the entire inventory planning" and "that basically we are here", which need to retain the original, but may form a more coherent paragraph by combining adjacent sentences. During the process, I will make sure that no additional content is added or deleted.

In particular, to confirm that there is no delete of any content, all the statements are included, and the transition between paragraphs is natural. After these steps, I will submit the collated paragraph verbatim to the user to ensure that they are fully met. </think> The following is the collated paragraph verbatim (fully retain all the original sentences, only adjust the paragraph structure): --- that emobility means that in this part of our green energy and the part of the bicycle, this year, we have a certain impact on the financial provider of help from last year to the first quarter of this year. I think that the overall stock planning, as well as the attitude of the customer, should be the general center's opinion or the second half of the year.

In the past, we have been focusing on this, and in the past, these mergers and acquisitions have emphasized this value, and the integration of the mid-market. This is basically a long-term, we still use green energy and LED as a larger mainstay, to engage in some of the issues that we've been dealing with in the past, and this mid-market has been on the topic of some mergers and acquisitions for a while. I would like to say that before answering all your questions, I would like to first talk about some of the issues that you are concerned about now.

I think this is the whole year from the first quarter, we still have some thoughts to look forward to the end of the year. Well, thanks to Mr. Tsai, Mr. Tsai, Mr. Tsai and Mr. Lin's briefing, the next is the online question time, will be hosted by Mr. Cai Yaokun, if you have any questions about the company, welcome to the online discussion, good to start the question, okay. So I think I already have some questions about this investment advanced here, I have some questions, I have some questions, I may be here to do a reply.

This is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business. It is a very important part of our business.

In general, it is possible to maintain the gross profit in general. The problem is that the current profit is in addition to the stock, the other is an economic scale, because the demand is affected by the front-end stock or too much, if there is no more production of the economic scale, our profit is relatively large. That is, we hope that in the same way as the current operation of this scale, the increase of the gross profit in the portfolio is a relatively large problem.

The problem is whether or not the entire scale of the current economy or the need, we need to pull it up in the next two to three quarters to see whether we should look at it or prospects, the economy should be relatively low, we want to improve this gross rate. The other is AIPC, and we can also ask about the impact of AIPC on NP4 booths, this question I explained last time, because the whole AIPC is not too volatile, but there is a neighboring thing, a relatively good because of the price relative to these AIPC, the price of the products, so this configuration of these peripheral products will basically be configured with a high specification, for example, it must be a backlit keyboard, that our product package basically pays a lot of attention.

If you are looking for a new product or service, you may be looking for a new product or service that will help you get the most out of your product or service. However, if you are looking for a new product or service that will help you improve your product or service, you may be looking for a new product or service that will help you get the most out of your product or service. However, if you are looking for a new product or service that will help you improve your product or service, you may be looking for a new product or service that will help you get the most out of your business. The green energy part is in Southeast Asia, which we actually included four barrels of new plant last year, so it should be ready at the end of the second quarter of this year, and then there should be a new capacity in Vietnam, so green energy should be the whole of the bicycle industry that will have some more capacity out this year, because it actually takes time, it is not possible to market the market to come to us again, so this is a little early layout, then the whole green energy in addition to this serious disease in Taiwan, the whole of the production gradually lead to this Vietnam, in the future will not be excluded from all reports in our Europe, to set up some local production line to meet the needs of local guests.

It's been said that 2025 is the year of the construction of this line of products.

That's basically green energy and IT this year should be both growth. The green energy will be more related because of the growth of the Grow method, but slightly increased this green can be in some light inventory. Some of the light inventory. That Grow method complements this, so let's look at the proportion of products for the entire two party groups this year.

Of course, there is a chance that green energy can go back to 30 to 40 weeks ago. The rest is the contribution of the so-called IT population. Includes the part of this computer peripheral to the MC. This is probably a situation throughout the year in the product portfolio. Then someone asked this.

Grow's revenue contribution, for example. Because Grow's law came in last quarter last year. Then the first quarter was the traditional season of this channel. So it should be back in the first quarter.

Our revenue is also a percentage of our contribution. That looks good right now. Probably the last time I took a photo with Grow. I've already reported this year's revenue. In the last legal meeting, everyone should check it out.

Last time I spoke about that number, it was probably a part of the first quarter. So it looks good right now. That's why it's gross profit. It's still maintained in a certain proportion from the channel. The more obvious contribution should be in the second quarter.

Because the second quarter is the peak season of traditional channels. We look forward to the second quarter in addition to revenue. There is also a clear contribution to the group in Maori. Then there is a problem.

This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, which he spake unto them, saying, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for the time is at hand; for the time is at hand.

If green energy is deducted from 60 to 65, then green energy is the starting point of 35 to 40. This is probably the case. Southeast Asia is, of course, the factory except for North Vietnam. Some are produced in this area. In fact, the whole Southeast Asia region is still there.

Even though some of the IT has moved to Vietnam and this Thailand, the proportion of the whole. There is also a small percentage around the entire computer, but the absolute value is not as high as green energy. In fact, we also have some products in Europe.

But that part is currently the main service. What we are more looking forward to is Europe in emobility. It is also possible to have some fermentation for a long time on a bicycle. Especially some local guests need some manufacturing capacity. This part I think should be 25 years. That is, 26 years in the second half of this year.

Before we had a computer around us, there was a market there too. It also has these assembly productions. It wanted to increase the proportion of local service customers. It was generally this product in every region.

One of them said, 'This is what we are going to do,' and another said, 'This is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do, this is what we are going to do.'

There is a brand of its own. That part is. Of course, I think the bike part is smaller. This is because most bicycle market Europe is the largest market. In fact, the U.S. spending is not much. So we look at our finances.

Whether it's from IT to IT, we add the whole green energy to our entire group. Bicycles from the point of view. Expenditure in the United States is affected. It's a pretty big number. Because even EMS is the OEM industry. Our goods are probably part of our customers.

It is only after the customer has assembled it, so the expenditure of the American component is not. So we look at it now. Compared to our customers are more affected. This, of course, is indirect.

If there is a tariff problem, the customer is willing to reduce the shipping percentage. Of course, we are affected by this single product. We are in these IT or green energy.

Whether we are in the US or in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US, we are in the US.

I'm sure there are some questions I've asked. I've probably answered them here. I've got one more question. I've been asked what this e-bike is about. Develop new trends.

That's because this is a good question because it's been around for the past few years. Everyone is conservative, so even if something is new, it's not very high.

This is not the case, but it is the case in this market, especially in the e-bike market, although it has been around for the past year and a year.

Let's take a look at the market for that channel. There are also in the online commercial market. That's especially now in e-bike. The discount ratio is very high. But we're going to see the next e-bike.

The word of the Lord is not shortened, but it shall be shortened, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall be shortened, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall be shortened, saith the Lord of hosts.

The next e-bike. Particularly the electronic part. As this wave of inventory is decomposed, I think progress will be faster. Then, in these electronic supply chains, the choice will be more and more.

This is the way of the righteous, the way of the wicked, the way of the wicked, the way of the wicked, the way of the wicked.

The other is, of course, the United States of America. So it looks like it is. The United States of America. So it will come from mainland China. Maybe it will be moved to Southeast Asia or somewhere else.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript:. That's a lot of it that includes these e-bikes along with other bikes. It will also drive these supply chains from some of these components of the Mainland to this Vietnam.

However, I suggest you to keep an eye out for this show. In late June, Europe was the biggest show in Europe, and it was a big show in their homeland. By the end of the year, the condition of all the guests and the condition of the order should be clearer. The second half of the year until next year, the trend of the entire market.

One problem is how much Vietnam capacity will make up for the total capacity. This is actually the case for some of our guests because some of us are still out of the mainland market. I think it is about two numbers at the moment. Those guests, of course, have a relatively high proportion of some of the guests. So the ratio of this capacity is currently more than two. In the second half of this year, adding Thailand to Vietnam should not only include Thailand.

That's why it's not necessarily what we make up all of us in Southeast Asia. So I think it's not necessarily what we make up all of us. But I think it should be more than two numbers, but it should be a separate customer or see what they're going through. Well, I think I can explain the relationship between time and time. I think everyone here will make a detailed explanation.

If you have any other questions, I hope you can contact us in the future. Of course, we will try to answer some of your doubts about our business from this point of view. OK Thank you very much for your time.

Last but not least, I would like to thank you all for investing in advanced health.
