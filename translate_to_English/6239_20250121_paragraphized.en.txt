VCHIP 4.2% compared to the first half of the year 4.3% compared to 4.3% compared to 4.1% in the same period of 23 years, it is only 0.1% different. Overall, the ratio of VCHIP is within 1%, in fact, there is no significant change. For the whole year, the silver share of the package process classification, in the previous year, the copper process 2024 slightly decreased by 0.2 percentage points, the gold wire process also decreased by 0.4 percentage points, the VCHIP rose by 0.6 percentage points. In fact, we just talked about new customers joining VCHIP, so we hope that VCHIP will continue to grow in 2025.

In the second half of 2024, we look at the classification of this middle market, which is about 55. 6%, Computer 7. 2%, Communication 8. 6%, Automotive 3. 6%, AI 1. 6%, Industry 3. 4%. Among them, there is only Consumer Computing and Industry AIP 3. 4%, so we can see that AI is growing more than the above silver revenue, and that communication-related communications-related information is slightly lower, and that only the second half of the second half of the year is mainly due to the rapid decline in the international automobile market, which is mainly due to the decline in the market, which is the difference in the sales ratio of each category compared to the previous year.

The second is the slow growth of industrial and consumer electronics, and the third is the increase in demand for new PC and notebook products, and the rise in demand for high-end esports, so the capacity of production is also slightly increased. DDR5's module market heats up, and PMIC-related ICs are gradually increasing. The demand for automotive-related electronics has just been rapidly reduced, so the demand for automotive-related electronics has declined in the second half of the year.

The second AI terminal device has the opportunity to promote the development of the switch slot, Future Samsung products are strong, the output of new customers, and the actual addition of the operation number. Analog chips have emerged a climatic signal, and are in the process of resuming the recovery. The transition effect of U.S.-China science and technology stations should be noted for significant revenue this year. The second U.S.-China trade war is actually fermentation, Taiwan IC design company is limited to China's policy requirements for self-governance, and to improve the development of China's trend.

In the face of competition pressure in Taiwan, we continue to optimize the competitiveness of the product and cost market. In fact, we will continue to invest in AI and automation and reduce manufacturing costs to enhance our competitiveness. The last one is that Q1 customer orders are very conservative, but we can expect that our capacity utilization will be slightly increased compared to the same year. Thank you, General Manager.

We can see that the fourth quarter of revenue reached 170.97 billion, compared to this year's third quarter of 183 billion, the QOQ part was reduced about 6.6 percentage points. The reduction here is mainly the familiar industry-based, the customer order to keep, so in the PTI this D-RAN and the NAN part, the reduction of about 6 to 16 percentage points, respectively, resulting in a decrease in revenue.

So, in terms of the net operating interest rate in the industry, from the 27th part to the 19.98th part of this figure. In fact, when it comes to the outer part of the industry, you can see that the industry outside the fourth quarter has about 3,800 profits, which is just mentioned here, because the fourth quarter of the relationship between depreciation, there are about 4.2 billion exchange benefits here. However, in the third quarter of last year, the loss of about 63 million, in fact, this section covers nearly 200 million exchange losses, so the change in the course of time between this subject is relatively large.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will read the whole transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this is a discussion of financial reporting, involving comparisons of revenue, gross profit margin, net business profit, out-of-the-box revenue, etc. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2024, there are timestamps and divisions in the content that need to be merged into natural smooth paragraphs while keeping the original intention intact. Next, I need to figure out how to segment. Generally, the structure of financial reporting will have different parts, such as revenue analysis, gross profit margin changes, out-of-the-box revenue, annual comparison, etc.

For example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the portion of revenue can be combined into a segment, followed by the analysis of gross profit margins, and then the impact of out-of-the-office revenues, and finally an annual comparison and summaries. In the process, it is important to pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure that the sentences are arranged in the correct order of time. At the same time, it is necessary to check if there are duplicate or need to merge sentences, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted or rewritten, so it can only be arranged in the original order. For example, the user mentions "23-year Q4" and "about 191 billion parts" are in the same segment and should be combined.

In addition, be aware of the accuracy of professional terms and numbers, such as "the part of the YY is roughly reduced by one percent" may refer to the Year-over-Year, which needs to be retained as a whole. At the same time, the number such as "16.500 million" should be kept in the original format without any modification. When organizing paragraphs, there may be some sentences that need to be adjusted to match the position in logical order. For example, the comparison of contributions and deductions from Xi'an revenue should be put in the same paragraph to maintain the consistency of the context.

For example, a "less part of this section" can be combined with the previous sentence to form a natural transition. Finally, check that the entire paragraph meets the user's requirements: without deleting any sentences, everything is arranged in the original order, and the content is logical between the paragraphs, and the language is smooth. At the same time, ensure that the accuracy of the timestamps and numbers, and avoid any formatting errors. After the initial draft, I will read again to make sure that each sentence is correctly placed without omissions or errors.

Here is the finishing paragraph transcript: 23 years of Q4 about 191 billion parts, the YY part is reduced about one percent, about one percent, and I think the lower part is mainly the low part. Here, let's take a look back at the 23rd year, we also included the whole year of Xi'an, so in the 23rd quarter of the year Xi'an revenue contributed about 16.500 million. So if we cut this 191 billion, basically, the revenue part is probably only about 200 million compared to the same period last year, and the YY part is about 200 million, probably less than two percentage points.

The fourth quarter of last year included 70% of our shareholding in Suzhou last year, which contributed about 3.5 billion losses, and some of the exchange losses. Therefore, outside the industry, the profit from the last quarter of last year has changed from 2.8 billion to 3.02800. Therefore, the whole quarter of last year's income in fact includes the 3.5 billion share of the benefit, so if this part of the benefit is deducted last quarter of last year, about 8 billion net income, compared to this year's fourth quarter of this year, about 19.19 billion, it is quite a growth.

This part of the total cost is also optimized from the last 17.9 part of last year, continuously optimized to 19.1%. The whole cost part is increased from 44.500 to 46.3 billion. Therefore, I think this is a profit performance in this industry, even in 2023, we have a full year of revenue in Xi'an and Suzhou for nine months, in 24 years, only six months of revenue in Xi'an, so the whole net profit part can continue to grow a little percentage.

So the whole point is that the income we recorded last year was a fraction of the income 95 billion, EPS 10. 72, 2024 no longer have this part of the transaction, that income reached 8.5 billion, then EPS part reached 9.09. I think from the absolute number, it seems that everyone would feel a lot of change. Then I want to look back on the fact that we have a relatively large transaction in the two years 2023 and 2024, so on the basis of the consistency of the two, let me do a report with you.

First of all, in the 2023 report, we covered the whole year of Xi'an revenue and nine months of Suzhou's nine-month Suzhou. That number, if we peeled this part from last year's 74 billion, the part of the 73 billion Xi'an revenue, including close to 30 billion Xi'an revenue, so if we cut this part of Xi'an's revenue, you can see that the revenue part of this part of Xi'an revenue is increased from 630 billion to 699 billion, the growth of this YY to about 11% I would like to see more clearly on a more consistent basis.

The average gross profit margin is lower than that of the company's Coverage Average. So take this part off when the low gross profit margin is lower.

Add some relatively new products like AI with high gross profit. Its profit from it. 2023 18.9. slightly raised to a portion like 19.5 this year. Some gross profit margin portion of that YY also increased by about 0.6 percentage points.

If we put it down, we put it down. Suzhou this transaction is 3 1⁄2 pcs. EPS takes it out. There is also a corresponding currency contribution for 2023 EPS. About 6. 46 is about 6. 46.

Compared to this year. Compared to this year. Compared to this year. Semi-annual. Semi-annual. The semiannual revenue contribution of Xi'an was removed. Our year-round EPS was about 8.62.

8. 62 So the growth of this YY. Almost 30%. I would like to talk about it here. The display part. The efforts of PDI colleagues. I would like to do the same in terms of gross profit margin and EPS.

They will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there, they will be there.

The growth of revenue has a relatively consistent basis. That I think is above all, we're all in this last year.

An overview of revenue gains and losses. That last part is reported to you. The results of our debts can be seen. We are in a report in last year's byte. The total assets of the byte are up to 1091 million.

1091 billion. This figure is more than in September. Probably 1031 is basically still able to continue to increase. The rest of the cash is to 2.2 billion. 2.2 billion.

The total amount of that debt is to 374 million. The number of September is basically the same. The difference is not much. But because of the increase in total assets, the ratio of debt is from the 34.9 part of September. Continued optimization to 34.3.

The US stock market. The net worth of the US stock market also comes from. Also from 74. 74. 77. This number. This number can continue to increase compared to the number 72.68 in September.

I think such a financial structure is inside. The displayed part is if PTI is still in progress this year. Like. 2024 more than KPX. Or a share allocation related to this year. I think such a financial structure is not going to happen.

I would like to say that this part of the message to be delivered to you. I think we are in this financial structure. We have one.

One size fits all, one size fits all, one size fits all, and one size fits all.

** Paragraph-based transcription (undeleted, unrewritten)**. [2049. 98-2051. 98] Take the form of our service. [2051. 98-2054. 98] Our test is 23 percent. [2054. 98-2058. 98] Our SIP with our module part is 10 percent. [2058. 98-2061. 98] Packaging part is 67 percent. [2061. 98-2066. 98] There is no significant change to our 3Q comparison.

[2066. 98-2070. 98] This part is similar to what we had before. [2070. 98-2072. 98] Not very big. [2072. 98-2080. 98] This part is also a part of our service type. [2080. 98-2083. 98] The test is also 22 percent. [2083. 98-2085. 98] The module part 10 percent. [2085. 98-2088. 98] That last year 2024 is now 2025.

[2096. 98-2098. 98] That last year's words our module here SIP section because there is a lot of demand for some AI. [2096. 98-2098. 98] That last year's words our module here SIP section because there is a lot of demand for some AI. [2098. 98-2103. 98] That came because it was used for AI server. [2103.2106. 98] So that part of our business had a significant growth. [2106. 98-2108. 98]

[2108. 98-2110. 98] This package is 68 percent. [2110. 98-2112. 98] Compared to last year. [2112. 98-2114. 98] In fact, it has not changed much since 2023 69 percent. [2114. 98-2112. 98] This is our fourth quarter. [2122. 98-2124. 98] Consolidated Remedy by Product.

[2124. 98-2126. 98] By our products. [2126. 98-2128. 98] The low-cost word is 19 percent in the fourth quarter. [2128. 98-2130. 98] NAND Flash part is 28%. [2130. 98-2132. 98] NAND Flash part is 28%. [2132. 98-2134. 98] The SIP and Module part are 11 percent. [2134. 98-2136. 98] The SIP and Module part are 11 percent.

[2136. 98-2138. 98] The logical part is 42 percent. [2138. 98-2140. 98] Because of the fourth quarter we are actually. [2140. 98-2142. 98] We face. [2142. 98-2144. 98] NAND Flash their entire inventory decline. [2144. 98-2146. 98] There is no such thing as expected. [2146. 98-2148. 98]

[2148. 98-2150. 98] There is no demand for something as expected. [2150. 98-2152. 98] The NAND part is slightly lowered a bit. [2152. 98-2154. 98] So it dropped from the 31st part of the third quarter. [2154. 98-2156. 98] So it dropped from the 31st part of the third quarter. [2156. 98-2158. 98] The 28% of the fourth quarter. [2158. 98-2160. 98] This is also related.

[2160. 98-2162. 98] Large stock adjustments. [2162. 98-2164. 98] Because of the actual demand for AI. [21664. 98-2166. 98] Or. [2166. 98-2168. 98] But the demand for this part of the phone. [2168. 98-2170. 98] But the demand for this part of the phone. [2170. 98-2172. 98]

[2172. 98-2174. 98] has decreased relatively. [2174. 98-2176. 98] Thus NAND has decreased significantly. [2176. 98-2178. 98] Thus NAND has decreased significantly. [2178. 98-2180. 98] This page is [2180. 98-2182. 98] We talk about 2024. [2180. 98-2184. 98] By our products are different.

[2184. 98-2186. 98] The low is 22 percent. [2186. 98-2188. 98] The NAND is 28 percent. [2188. 98-2190. 98] The module part is 10 percent. [2190. 98-2192. 98] The logical part is 40 percent. [2192. 98-2194. 98] You can see it from 2024. [2194. 98-2196. 98] Our logical part is still available.

[2196. 98-2198. 98] We still have our logic part. [2198. 98-2200. 98] is still growing. [2200. 98-2202. 98] The lower part is 22 percent. [2202. 98-2204. 98] The lower part is 22 percent. [2204. 98-2206. 98] The NAND just speaks. [2206. 98-2208. 98] The NAND is actually better than the previous year.

[2208. 98-2210. 98] There is still a decline. [2210. 98-2212. 98] We expect it to be in the future. [2212. 98-2214. 98] In 2025, AIPC may be available. [2214. 98-2216. 98] We may also have applications for our AI. [2216. 98-2218. 98] The demand for NAND. [2218. 98-2220. 98] We hope for the second quarter of next year.

[2220. 98-2222. 98] We hope for the second quarter of next year. [2222. 98-2224. 98] or even the slowest words in the second half of the year. [2224. 98-2226. 98] The demand for NAND should be clearly growing. [2226. 98-2228. 98] The demand for NAND should be clearly growing. [2228. 98-2230. 98] This part is waiting for us. [2230. 98-2232. 98]

[2232. 98-2234. 98] In our Outlook section. [2234. 98-2236. 98] We will talk about it. [2236. 98-2238. 98] This part of the conversation is [2238. 98-2240. 98] Our fourth quarter. [2240. 98-2242. 98] Our renewal by end market. [2242. 98-2244. 98] The final market look.

[2244. 98-2246. 98] The car is 14 percent. [2246. 98-2248. 98] That communication. [2248. 98-2250. 98] is 24 percent. [2250. 98-2252. 98] communication section is slightly reduced. [2252. 98-2254. 98] Because mobile networking and wireless. [2254. 98-2256. 98] VR here.

[2256. 98-2258. 98] In our communications. [2258. 98-2260. 98] It is dropped. [2260. 98-2262. 98] Because it is actually a mobile here. [226.2. 98-2264. 98] The computing section. [2264. 98-2266. 98] is 25 percent. [2266. 98-2268. 98] It is the third quarter.

[2268. 98-2270. 98] The third quarter. [2270. 98-2272. 98] We have significant growth. [2272. 98-2274. 98] The consumer section. [2274. 98-2276. 98] We are 27 percent. [2276. 98-2270. 98] Also growth. [2278. 98-2280. 98] The industry section.

[2280. 98-2282. 98] Food for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. [2282. 98-2284. 98] The AI part. [2284. 98-2286. 98] Yes. [2286. 98-2288. 98] The Porsche equivalent of 8 percent. [2288. 98-2282. 98] This is our overview. [2290. 98-2292. 98] The fourth quarter.

[2292. 98-2294. 98] This part 2024. [2294. 98-2296. 98] We can see. [2296. 98-2298. 98] automotive is 14 percent. [2298. 98-2309. 98] In fact, the automotive part. [2300. 98-2302. 98] In fact, it is slowly falling. [2302. 98-2304. 98] I want to invest in the market.

[2304. 98-2306. 98] The media circle of friends. [2306. 98-2308. 98] We all know very well. [2308. 98-2310. 98] This is a part of the car. [2310. 98-2312. 98] Because EVCAR actually has been greened. [2312. 98-2314. 98] The whole area of the economy. [2314. 98-2316. 98] It is not very good.

[2316. 98-2318. 98] The market is also saturated. [2318. 98-2320. 98] So the automotive part is the word. [2320. 98-2322. 98] There are a lot of changes. [2322. 98-2324. 98] Especially in China market. [2324. 98-2326. 98] They basically hope to make their own.

[2328. 98-2330. 98] So what we have to say about our customers. [2330. 98-2332. 98] There will be some questions. [2332. 98-2334. 98] Now we are here. [2334. 98-2336. 98] We are grateful for the four-ring sources we keep around the world. [2336. 98-2338. 98] We are very grateful. [2338. 98-2332. 98] The end is almost the same.

[2352. 98-2354. 98] We are full of the deepest water. [2354. 98-2356. 98] is like limit. [2356. 98-2362. 98] is full essayer. [2362. 98-2365. 54] The AI part is almost four words. [2365. 54-2367. 34] Four Percent from the first quarter. [2367. 34-2368. 86] From our statistics.

[2368. 86-2370. 92] Our second quarter began statistics. [2370. 92-2372. 20] At that time, six Percents. [2372. 20-2374. 24] The eight Percents that we have grown to this day. [2374. 24-2376. 04] I would like to say in AI. [2376. 04-2377. 58] We are in our 2025. [2377. 58-2379. 62] will continue to grow.

[2379. 62-2390. 90] Because of our recent. [2380. 90-2383. 98] A lot of investment is for the AI in the investment. [2383. 98-2386. 02] We hope to be at least in the third quarter of 2025. [2388. 32-2390. 12] Should bring a comparison. [2390. 12-2393. 94] More contributions.

[2392. 94-2406. 78] We are the whole. [2396. 78-2398. 32] 4Q24's business. [2398. 32-2400. 62] Probably we will do a summary. [2400. 62-2404. 20] The G1T of the standard group. [2404. 20-2405. 48] Second half of the demand is conservative.

[2407. 78-2410. 60] Quarterly revenue showed a decrease. [2410. 60-2413. 16] But I do not include Xi'an. [2413. 16-2414. 70] If we do not include Xi'an. [2414. 70-2417. 00] Take Xi'an for the first half of the year.



In fact, the impact of this part of LIFRAM base is relatively small. In fact, it should be more benefit from the whole product, because we are in this trade competition, because a lot of low-level LIFRAM base products, before many, our big competitors are from mainland China, when it is blocked the whole time, in fact, the ultra wind is benefited. We also see Q1, just in our season, Q1 looks basically better than last year, as the so-called 2023, Q1 of 2024 should be better, this is what it is, because we have some new customers come in, his new customers, before production in mainland China, a lot before production, they have decided to move to the ultra-cold, so we have no problem. The second point, as AI functions gradually penetrate the new model of AIPC AI mobile phone, VG2025 will be worthy of attention to the polar groove, help to promote the demand of DRAM, here is only talk about DRAM, I just said about the actual NAND, because we have done a research recently, in fact, not only DRAM, because many related reports are talking about HBM, or their own different package type DRAM, can support the so-called AI needs, the AIPC so-called H-computing, in fact, H-computing it may not necessarily use HBM, it may have different package requirements, but its IO is between between HBM, between our Commerce DRAM.

This part of the DRAM needs to be pulled up, and we just talk about NAND, NAND is the same, because we also did research, NAND part is not as we say, with the so-called AI application is completely unrelated, because AI, our so-called Cloud computing, even our customers have shipped, SSD has been out to 130 terabytes, even to 150 terabytes, this is a very large one, for Component, their needs may be 16 iterations, even 25 iterations 24 iterations iterations, who can do this, we only so far, apart from Korea's two originals, the other only we can do, this part will be driven. I just talk about NAND, because we have talked about the first section of our closed-end order, but the second part of the second year of the demand, we will be the same as the second year, we will be the next year we have the same as the next year, we have the same as the same as the same as the next year, we have the demand, we have the same as the same as the same as the next year, we have the same as the same as the same as the same as the next year, we have the same as the same as the same as the same as the next year, we have the demand, we have the same as the same as the same as the same as the next year, we have the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same, we have, we have the same, we have to the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same So we also successfully began mass production in the fourth quarter, which is completely compatible with the so-called Cloud computing, so-called Cloud computing, the CPU server shipped together, we also see that it is significant growth in Q1, that advanced packaging part, including 2. 5D 3D products, continue to be developed in quarters, we have said at the beginning of last year, we hope that this part, we can ready at the end of 2024, in fact, because there are some things related to the intersection of the equipment, its intersection length is actually more than we expected, then we think that the part should be the journey.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-phrase script: We should get it soon, but it is definitely not what we expected from our customers. Our panel level is also the same as our panel level. We have a few customers who develop the HBM part of our HBM part of our HBM part of ours, of course, HBM part of ours has the so-called HBM2 HBM2E HBM3 Sun I. This part of ours is actually ready for HBM2 and HBM2E, but in HBM3 we will have the opportunity to report with you about this part of the Teleport part, and I would like to share with you the good news that we have a lot of investment especially our Telepower part.

In addition to being part of the Association's Global Sustainability Report, we have also included a part of the Bronze Award report which we have included in our internal report a real-world case that can be shared with the industry or a friend as a reference to the best case. I think that this is in addition to the award-winning part of the capital market, we have also received Taiwan's index companies and the internationally renowned Fuji companies in developing Taiwan's ESG constituents and emerging market ESG constituents listed in the so-called constituent stocks. One of the award-winning part I think also confirms that PTI's role in ESG and ongoing investment efforts within the company is actually strengthening this as well as through the corresponding corporate approach to the corresponding board, and we have also invited suppliers in the last year to explain our commitment to carbon management and integrity recommendations and anti-bribriberage.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and convert it into a paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the rules and examples of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed verbally and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and content. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the original sequence and content of each sentence. Special attention is needed to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural without adding any extra content. Next, I will analyze it in a sentence to see which sentences can be combined into paragraphs.

The following is the Chairman's speech, including encouragement of policy, EPS data, financial situation, etc. These need to be segmented, but maintain the independence of each sentence. In the processing of technical parts, such as HBM, TSV, FanOUT, etc., need to ensure the correct arrangement of technical terms, and the explanation of each technical point maintains the order of the original sentence. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of the timestamp, to ensure that the conversion between paragraphs does not disrupt the original order of time.

In addition, some sentences may have timestamp jumps, such as the time period in between, but the user does not provide the content, so it is necessary to keep the original without adding any speculative content. Finally, I will read through the whole converted paragraph verb, check if all the original sentences are correctly contained, no omissions or duplicates, and the transition between paragraphs is natural, logically. At the same time, make sure that there are no rules that are not violating any user settings, especially those that do not delete, do not rewrite, do not condensate content.

In addition, it is also crucial to ensure that the logical alignment of technical terms and paragraphs is also critical. It is necessary to carefully review the position of each sentence to ensure that the converted paragraphs accurately reflect the structure and content of the original transcription. In summary, the process requires careful procedural processing, keeping the originality and order, while reasonably organizing the paragraphs to ensure that the final result is consistent with all the requirements of the user.

Thank you. The above is the description of the technology and super wind electronic management team. Since the upcoming year, before Q&A, we would like to invite the chairman to visit us earlier this year, and explain this year's incentive policy, as well as recent developments in technology, such as HBM flight PLP COGOS and other issues, as well as the latest developments in product development for our customers.

First of all, I would like to report to you all that I would like to wish you a Happy New Year. I would like to ask the first question about encouraging the release of the policy. Our past history encourages the release of this encouragement by not less than 60% of EPS. In the last year of our 2024, we issued 7 pieces of money in 2023, and our EPS10.72, which is probably 65%. Then this year, our EPS9.09, although it is slightly lower than the previous year of 2023, we still do better than the previous year. So considering our investment community, as well as ours, and all of our finances, we still think we are able to deliver a good EPS distribution rate.

I think this is the first question we would recommend to the board of directors. I think the second is the direction of the research of our new product technology. The first we do the image sensor of our TSV technology, and I think we are the few in the industry to be able to use TSV technology to do the CSV consensus.

The second year rate is also relatively high. In this respect, we have received a verified finish, the only thing left is that the car uses our parts and the component level of our own parts we have pass the car, but there is a little improvement in the use of the end of the boot level, but I think we can break it in a short period of time. The second is HBM, I think HBM is divided into two directions to see it. The first is used in the mainstream, just like the current AI is equipped by SOC, equipped with three mainstream DRAM long-man construction HBM, which is used in high performance high density application, which is an application.

Another application surface is in many AI applications it does not need such HBM to complete it, or that its SOC design is quite complex, but it has a big function to do it, the HBM configuration is different, these two markets. Just as we have said by our CEO, its gap in HBM2 and 2E is that every wafer and every wafer gap is about 20 micron below 20, and the ball size is a little bit larger, in this area we already can do it, and it is no problem. Now the most mainstream DRAM manufacturers want to be able to enter HBM3 and HBM3E above, and this part we need a little effort to overcome it.

But in overall, our development in this regard is very much we have to break through all of our problems, we should say that we absolutely can do this this year, so we are very sure of our team's efforts. The people were talking about 2. 5D 3. 5D FANOUT, I think FANOUT where you go to think this is the trend of the future, and then we are this FANOUT. In the past all we just wanted to do is FANOUT on the side of the PANELSIDE PANEL, and on our own Polymy interposures. But in reality, I think TSMC core has become like a standard, so we want to be able to provide this service, so we have also built up our chip on wafer is the capacity, we have created, and we can do it well.

So this package is getting bigger and bigger, the die size is getting bigger, and then the integration with other components together, its die size is really not enough, so our panel becomes a big advantage. So many customers now require us to be able to directly do the chip on panel, but the only problem we have, I think that all of us will be the problem is that when we originally designed this chip on panel, we want to be the middle end, some wafer manufacturing, we want to do it on panel, but when we want to be in the package, we want to be in the subpanel, cut it into subpanel to do so, but now we want to say that we can do more, it is a panel can be put together, but it is not easy, so we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we have a big, we have to do it, we have a big, it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have a big, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we have it, we That I think this year will be different from last year, the biggest thing, last year was our first quarter of the first quarter was very good, the third quarter because of the customer inventory adjustment, so we will gradually the third quarter of the year, not as good as we imagined, this year we will be on the contrary, we will do this, we will start, because the customer inventory adjustment, coupled with a slow down of the mainland economy, so it may be a bit hard, but we will gradually get better, coupled with the development of new technology, we should be, we are optimistic about our future development, thank you, Mr. Chairman, next is Q&A time, online investors please enter your questions, enter the dialog box below, I will show you a detailed answer from the current screen.

This is where investors ask about China's ultra-high-frequency problems, the outlook of China's ultra-high-frequency 2025, and the third-generation semiconductor seal test capabilities. What is the current situation, I would like to answer this question. Ultra-high-frequency semiconductor in the third-generation semiconductor, in fact, we are all talking about this part of the nitride price, because it does not require new equipment, so this part is actually, in the ultra-high-frequency part of our production in 2020, we already have several customers in ultra-high-frequency operation, that part in 2024, we are probably revenue about 200 million, which accounts for the whole last year revenue, about 1.5%, and of course there are other manufacturers in China's ultra-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-level-high-high-high-high-high-high-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-level-high-high-high-high-high-high-level-level-level-level-level-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-level-level-level-level-level-level-high-level-level-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-level-level-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-high-

We also have some Engage, so we really have a chance to go to the international market because he is out there. So I believe that we have a little chance to talk about that, and then there is a more clear time, and then there is a report. And because the whole AI server, like some superwind products continue to grow, that AIP exchange slot, I believe this is a positive direction for the superwind, because our products are also doing, and that is only because of the effect of Trump, in fact, the future will change, and sometimes we are hard to determine.

I think this is an advanced report with all my media friends today, thank you. I don't know how to do this, thank you. Due to the time relationship, we have to ask a question for our online friends. Please be honest, what is the outlook for operation in 2025? What are the product demand delays in the fourth quarter of 2024? Then what are the changes in capital expenditure in 2025?

a better opportunity, other Advanced Packaging, we also according to our plan is going to go, to grow in the direction of the future, this part is our 2025 business outlook, in the next part of our, our KBA part, I find our general manager JS to answer, thank you, the management team share, the above will complete today's corporate briefing, investors can be set up to watch the presentation of today's speech, and video replay, thank you for your participation, we wish you all the healthy investment is smooth, thank you all.
