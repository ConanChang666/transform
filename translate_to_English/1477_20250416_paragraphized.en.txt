Hello everyone, today we started the meeting, I am Jackie of the ocean, next to the cultural person Henry, thank you for giving us this opportunity, but this hour we will say that we will disclose some relatively simple information, but may be due to the change in time and space play, does not constitute the recommendation of trading stocks. First of all, I will be here for further analysis, and then Henry to tell us that some of our concerns about tariffs and practices, the company has been finished in the first quarter, basically does not meet our previous estimates, when the shipment volume is slightly increased compared to the previous one, probably added some of the main reason is actually the end of consumption or not good, affordable clothing may be afraid of inflation and tariffs, so the price of things sold is good. So in some early April some goods may be sold, low inventory, so he first pulled it out at the end of March.

另外的話我們在去年在報第一季的價格的時候有把一些勞動力的成本的一個增加,這個有隱藏進去了,所以說第一季的一個價格增加幅度就跟我們預期的差不多,所以說這個是量跟價都是跟去年比都是好的,那當然在這個所謂的一個獲利角度來看的話目前看毛利的表現應該也是看起來也是一隻燕子春燕比就是一隻還不錯的就是這樣子,那這個是目前第一季的看法。 二季度目前來講的話量也是跟去年同期比我們也覺得是一個不錯的表現,最主要是我們的一個二季度的產能陸續開出了,所以說這邊的產能跟客戶的一個訂單之前做Making就是一個不錯的表現,目前來看的話大家應該是會關心的是關稅的這一塊,那我們目前在這個時間點針對二季度的訂單都是如期的備料如期的生產當然也是如期的出貨,那所謂的帳款當然是如期的收錢,這個都沒有任何的delay,所以說並沒有大家可能在網路上看到一些傳聞是不是關稅一來結果越南中國這邊都已經中國不敢講越南這邊是不是東南亞這邊都有什麼停工都不敢出貨啊然後就是等這個關稅並沒有這邊的一個狀況都是如期。 那這邊有回到第一個剛才講的就是中端的消費還是在跑這個客戶的庫存水位是相對來講是健康的,那目前又卡了一個90天的這個關稅,所以其實消費者你在想說他預期90天後會不會漲價可能會啊,所以說在買的部分是可以先買嘛,所以說在這個名聲必需品方面這邊的一個消費力道都還是有,所以說我們目前來講的話二季度的訂單都是如期的生產製造出貨,那關稅至於說關稅10%那10%目前因為二季度的合約都是之前對應跟客人議定好都已經簽好合約了,所以這邊的一個收款就是為了這個關稅的合約,所以我們現在是完全的收款,那個關稅是客人我們是FOB10FOB10就是說貨物一旦生產完成在海關交到客戶指定的貨船上那邊的到這個時點為止債權跟物權就轉換,所以說我們這不是擁有的債權那物權就轉換給客戶,所以客戶這艘船的貨物啊到了中端市場比如說美國他要進海關他必須照這個合約的一個原始的一個價格去跟海關報關那清關最後你付完關稅你就提貨,所以這個流程都是由客戶執行完成,所以說這邊的一個關稅目前這邊這個90天應該說二季度的這邊的一個是由客戶的一個負責,那這邊的所以說這邊並不會影響到我們二季度的一個實際的一個表現,所以說其實今年來看的話雖然說外界的變化蠻大的但是其實以一個上半年來看的話我們還是有這個蠻大的信心去做到說這個量跟價那甚至獲利這邊應該我們都是覺得努力正向去做好。 這個是這個上半年包含二季度的一個狀況,那中端市場剛才就已經有提到了美系客戶這邊平價的賣的比較好,那所以說像我們的客戶來講的話美系的比較平價的品牌ONEVIADISCOTING他的自由品牌這些都賣的不錯,所以說這邊基本上我們的一個客戶都是一個量都還是有在增加,那日系客戶這邊來講的話我們是因為這邊有和二季度這邊也會玩工頭產,所以說基本上你要包場就是要訂單要填滿那個工廠的產能,所以說日系客戶今年全年我還是覺得訂單還是不錯這個就是因為有包場的一個關係,那加上其實日本本身國內市場的一個消費也不錯嘛大家都去日本玩嘛,所以說去日本玩日本的商品也不錯,那所以說日本的商品去日本玩就順便吃吃喝喝買買嘛,所以說其實日系的一個狀況也是不錯的。 那客戶端所以說我們客戶端的話當然第三季的訂單現在陸續在談,但是現在就卡在是說一個關稅因為90天的緩衝嘛90天緩衝是什麼意思就是到7月初那7月初那他就會跨到可能第三季那所以說客戶目前也是在看關稅談判的一個結果他就確認度就沒有那麼快他可以慢拖一點就是這邊也是看最後到底哪個國家是談好談出哪一個不錯的關稅的一個稅率,所以說目前來看的話就是會第三季訂單會慢慢確認一直到5月底6月初才有可能確認完畢,所以說到那時候來看第三季才會比較準下半年會比較準。 不過我們目前來談的話都是一個可能最基礎的10%的關稅的一個基礎在看那基本上我們其實第二季還是有一些訂單有機會量可能還是有機會再多一點可能就是因為關稅目前7月初嘛那7月中或7月底的訂單其實客戶也有希望說可以提前拉過那我們這邊還要看工廠的一個排交期生產的一個進度看看有沒有辦法配合客戶這樣的一個提前的一個動作,因為畢竟6月開始就已經步入我們的旺季旺月產能都很緊那這邊有沒有辦法提前我們就還是要看。

Basically, this is a view of the current situation. Basically, we believe that the company's performance is still worth waiting for, and I think it is a little more beautiful than the same period. For this reason, it is not much of a problem. The impact on tariffs will not occur in the first half of the year.

First of all, let's start with the conclusion that we are afraid to say too much. We believe that there is no white lunch in the world, so in the current situation of tariffs, there is a place to get. For the second half of the year, whether it is revenue or gross profit, basically do certain conditions, the impact is not too big.

So that means that you have more flexibility to help him in his duties adjustment, to have higher inventory management capabilities, in exchange for you do not bear that so-called tariff, who to share this with. This is a conclusion that we are currently communicating with. Of course, if you ask me in detail, there must be some reasons why you are not at the stall here. So this is what we will explain again.

So if the tariffs are so high in some countries, it is certain that this will lead to the transfer of the order. Now it is happening, or even a big transfer at a time. So you can imagine that if 20% of the U.S. economy has no recession, your other countries have to grow at least twice as fast, so you can eat this 20%. So the total amount of orders as long as you are not in a high tariff area, the amount of orders is increasing. This is the first point.

The reason for the shortening is obvious, that is, because tariffs do not know which countries will improve the current situation. So the shorter it is, the more flexible it is, the faster it is to transfer. So it is now a strategy to reduce the number of short orders. This involves every major supplier, and I believe the long orders will decrease.

Because you want to pay taxes to pay for Rush order, Rush order is too cheap to look at it from a current point of view. So the current Rush order is rather advantageous. Just say whether or not it has happened now, because everyone is not sure which place is the tariff is definitely lower. Now we are still talking about it.

The second is that the localization of raw materials is becoming more and more important. Customers are demand, not hope. That is why demand is a significant increase in the proportion of your localization. Because the tariffs in a country that must be there are relative advantages, they are also in line with the current logic of a local sourcing. So it's probably more like the ratio of localization to more than 60 Percent in Vietnam, which may be increased to 80% or higher this year.

This does not include all of the countries, such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, all of which are in this direction, or an integration of a regional type. Therefore, localization procurement is also becoming more and more important. Of course, there is another option to use U.S. raw materials. U.S. raw materials will not necessarily give you any advantage in tariff imports, because there is some relationship to the U.S. value.

So whether or not U.S. raw materials can benefit from tariffs is a question. This is because it depends on whether the Trump team will continue some of the policies before Biden. But even if some of the policies before Biden continue, it is a relatively safe source of raw materials. So many U.S. cotton or something like that is not a bad thing.

Because now we just look at the export country, that is, if you are exporting Vietnam, it depends on this tariff in Vietnam, you use a raw material in other countries, there is no clear regulation to stop it, or let it increase the cost. But 90 days later it won't be so. So that's what we're talking about.

Even if you can't afford to use localized sourcing, you must use some relatively high-level raw materials to do so. Like Indonesia, its proportion of localized sourcing may be less than 50%, so some raw materials it can obtain may go to Southeast Asia, or some relatively low-risk places to buy. Try to reduce some of the potential sources of risk, so this is an adjustment for some of the current customers to the tariffs. So you can conclude that from what customers are doing to communicate with suppliers about this matter, because the consumption in the United States is often the same as saying that it may buy something cheaper and more expensive, so they don't think that the brand can fully offset the tariff.

As the difference between short orders and long orders is usually a 2% discount to 2.5% discount before long orders, so because the long orders do not, so the order is you, because the short orders are more, so it can also reflect that you just do a little faster, you do not have a so-called tariff impact, so this is a relatively favorable way to say that there is a way to do a fast response to the supplier. So this is what we just said is not white lunch, but you can take it at the price, you can serve it to his place, this is the one we are talking about, so the ocean is more convenient, because we have always been guided by speed, so at this moment, if the customer starts a short order, even to short orders, we do not think we need to put too much pressure on the current situation above the tariff.

This is obviously the previous operation, so it is not now the operation, so it is caused that the brand in the so-called Direct Inputters the order is shrinking very quickly, because there is no profit now available, so he may find more suppliers that he has already depended on in Southeast Asia or Asia. That is, I still do not know how to speed up the expansion of the capacity, or because the tariff is really not yet determined which country is relatively safe, so we think that we will take this opportunity to review the second half of the order, keep those high profits and some core customers' orders, then the order of non-core customers may be eliminated.

That is to say, a lot of moisture between them, dust, etc. is not suitable to do some accumulation of energy services, this is more difficult structurally, so why say you see how many years in Central America actually do sportswear, this technology must be broken through, so it is not easy to transfer.

We all know that the discount is a potential increase in the price, so we all know. So we think that the current customers are basically looking at the attitude, and do not expect to do too much early to do some of the disappointment or some decisions that may come later. That is, until the whole more clear after the change, it should be a good thing for some service providers, especially some special service providers, so we think that we are actually in a very conservative direction to interact with the outside.

So we now estimate for the second half of the year is a slight growth of this thing, we still think that the actual order opportunity is more, but we don't want to trade some action at the present time, which may lead to the possibility of the better thing after the later. Then the thing came back, because usually if in a short period of time really explosive growth, the profit and price of the monthly counter will usually be better, not just the spring banquet may be a Phoenix or something. So we are now to wait and see whether there is a Phoenix first, there is a Phoenix is this shortage is the first, which is probably the current situation, then we can also enter the Q&A.

The first half of the year is not much change, there may be some customers who have some early shipping, but it is also related to the climate, which is not much. As we said, you can save very little, because the export price of one piece of clothing and the retail price may be 4 to 10 times the difference, so you want to say that if the difference is about 6, 7 times 6, 7 times the 10% of the tariff is really not much. So no one to save this a lot of money to take the risk is that you say that a retail price of 50 dollars to sell when you can't sell it, you have to pay at least 7 fold or more or become a whole problem.

As we said, we are all standing on one condition to maintain our position, that is, we are a company in Southeast Asia, we are a very comprehensive company. It looks like South East Asia orders will change, but the cost will also increase, so now we have the position that we do not want to increase so much, but I want to because the order increase all the bad orders, I just want to use my favorite to ensure that the cost increase does not affect me.

So, we can basically fully meet the requirements of the customer, so that means that we can basically fully meet the customer's requirements, so that we can basically meet the customer's requirements. So, we have to make some adjustments to the purchase of an order in a designated area, because we don't have a factory in China. So that for us, we have to be very open to the department to adjust, so even if Vietnam is required to buy Chinese food, no matter what we don't have to bear that pressure on the site, the pressure will be on the field.

So we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy, so we go to China to buy. Can you tell us what kind of customer requirements are? Last year we made it clear that all American brands basically for 2025 to buy for suppliers have a clear indication that these suppliers have the ability to have so-called Near Shore bid production. So it is not El Salvador, for the whole Central America, so you do not have this plant, basically you will be affected by this year's order, so the answer is basically all American brand customers have this kind of requirement.

The second half has nothing to do with the last one. So you can refer to what we talked about before, that is to keep up with the use of the right one no change. There may be a little bit of short expectations, but this should affect too little, and if there is something else, it should be behind, so it's time to make some adjustments.

Now that the whole supply chain is out of stock, everyone is out of stock. Maybe not here is the market now is out of stock or what. It is not possible because there may be some urgent shipping situation here in the electronics industry. But there may be some urgent shipping situation here in the electronics industry.

First of all, this probability should not be too large. Mainly because it is said that the current port corresponds to a real increase in exports. However, since the increase was more than last year, I believe everyone was going to refer to last year's shipping fee.

So you can think of a situation that is now a large amount of transportation but deferred. Take the plane with pure air, but basically the plane or on time to leave. Think about it. So we think it is that the guest you are talking about now is not asking you to ship early and tell you that you want to shorten the delivery process. So this is a concept of long-term preparedness.

He prefers to spend more money on what your rush order can be, rather than paying a short sum of money, and not saying it's time to pay this 30% or what suddenly becomes a tariff. That's clear. That's why we think this should continue until the tariff policy is fully determined. So it must be a long order decrease. A long order decrease usually means that there is not a trend that there is too much increase in the demand for containers.

So we believe that at least the current conditions of sailing are normal.

This is the most important thing to do in the world. The most important thing to do in the world is to get the most out of your business. It is important to know that you have the right to sell your business, and that you have the right to sell your business, and that you have the right to sell your products, and that you have the right to sell your products, and that you have the right to sell your products, and that you have the right to sell your products, and that you have the right to sell your products, and that you have the right to sell your products, and you have the right to sell your products, and you have the right to sell your products.

但缺點就是說因為都那麼透明所以你可以調整的空間也小對不過在這個關稅壓力比較大的情況之下這個透明化反而不是一件壞事就是說那個反正是該怎麼樣就怎麼樣對那個至少等到整個的一個狀況就是更明朗了我們再來做一些可能如何優化或等等的一個調整再去做後續的一個配套措施可是目前這樣子的一個整合方法反而是對很單純的成一場是相對有利的。 因為我們常研究的意思是說產能不足那我們今年的開拍是會因為關稅佔有什麼變化然後再來就是說剛才有提到說我們會做這個調單生產所以是說我們認為就算有關稅佔整個產能還是可以就是產能流利還是可以再一個滿載的狀態對你可以想想看就是就是好比說現在那個打火車或捷運突然少了一節車廂下班時間人還是一樣多那是不是每一個車廂塞的人是更多這是很正常的一個邏輯所以只要美國經濟不衰退的話少了一節車廂其他的車廂就是要存在更多的一個客人這個是那個既定的一個事實所以只是說你現在是在其他車廂的一個角色的時候我總是想要保護自己或那個讓我說我可以更有效的一個動作我就可以選擇。 如果可以選擇進來的人是誰我總是不喜歡挑一些可能就是我覺得可能會影響到美觀啊或什麼的可以專門挑一些就是自己喜歡的一個客人上車是這樣的一個邏輯去看這件事情所以那個當然是說未來的一個狀況還是有很大的一個變動可是在目前的一個條件跟狀況之下的話只要你不是在非常高關稅的地方其實基本上願意去談的話你的空間還是存在的所以我們一直想講這件事情就是說不要只看目前當下不好的東西你要看到就是說實際發生的一個狀況是美國20%的誠意來源目前不能用這件事情關稅確實增加了可是要如何解決這個20%的誠意來源但是20%不能用不影響美國自己本土通膨最好的做法是怎麼樣對從這個角度去看就大概知道是說品牌現在在做的一個調整跟準備是往哪個方向去進行所以我們為什麼不是太過度擔心就是我們認為是說到最後美國還是會以保護他的人民的一個方向去順利的去那個協商這件事情所以你們兩個都在跟我們要求一些談論的時候我們也覺得這個態度是沒有得到調整因為他也不知道川普明天會講什麼話對還是回顧到這件事情所以回到您的一個剛才問的問題就是capitalism會不會被影響基本上就是說一樣就是說因為你現在看不到前面的路在往哪裡走對我們就照原的計畫去進行。 因為擴充產能有些東西你可以提前做然後有些東西你可以後面再做因為蓋廠房不是一件太capital intensive就是你倉庫啊或這個大樓都可以蓋好你可以做的一些環評啊等等你都可以依照去做可是買機器設備招人訓練這三件事情可以等到確定之後再做對所以我們現在想就是說你如果是講說蓋廠房或者是請這個政府來那個做一些環評啊來確保這個的安全啊或什麼的如期進行那至於說買機器這件事情的話就一定是得等到這個關稅名啦對所以是不是會延後目前我覺得還不用太提早就下一個定論。

So we think that we can keep this time, we can have a flexible at the moment, because you wait for only 90 days, do not need to wait for the next 90 days, we feel that it is a relatively insurance practice. Again, please ask because I may not have been updated recently, now we have the second half of the second half of the gross profit margin what is the direction? Then because just mentioned that we may need more short goods in the factory, sometimes we may because of the short goods relationship lead to production efficiency may sometimes be less ideal, so how to cope with the second half of the situation?

可是如果你現在船班沒有問題的情況之下,就算工作量變多,這個對我們不是一件太大的問題,就是說你可以早上8點起床,8點就給我們,那這個一定下班前都會處理完,只要那個給的一個補償跟利潤夠,那一定非常非常的樂意的。 對所以我們認為是說這個倒不用太擔心,與其去想說跟去年一樣還不如這個比較像2021年那個時候的狀況,就是可能這個長單開始的減少然後短單的一個增加導致說後面可能短單可能越來越多,在2022年那個時候,你看2022年開始去庫存了,那時候短單短極單變得超級多,這種利潤是非常的好。 對所以我們認為說只要提供足夠的一個透明度跟可以掌握的一個訂單量的話,那這種的調整我們都是還蠻樂見的。 應該快了,大概5月第一週5月第一週,我想是那個是春宴,所以不用擔心。 不好意思我想請一下我們剛講的20%的美國成益來源是他們現在是沒有辦法進口的,這個20%是指說就是中國嗎還是你可以看一下美國全部高關稅的地方加一加那個20%就是10%然後就是我們現在的現在的現在的現在的你現在的這個就是10%對就是10%不是以90天後不是以它4月2號對就是現在現在多少這個就是20%這個是就是中國我們不知道再問一下這個關稅我們目前就是對生產的客稅嘛,如果是10%就是說假設生產價是100塊如果10%就課10塊那10塊剛好是100塊那10塊就是100塊我們現在是10塊我們現在就是10塊我們現在就是10塊我們現在就是10塊那10塊剛好是說品牌跟我們的供應鏈是各方也就是說品牌場是五塊那供應鏈的話又分乘以嘛就是它如果在各方的話那假如說五塊裡面那有時候有三分之一就是在一塊乘這一塊個權邏輯是這個樣子嘛可是就像剛剛我們講的就是說品牌角度就是說你只要提早給我請提前給我做來這個就跟你沒關係但是如果到234這個數字其實就比較有影響可是目前就沒有20、30%對就好像說你要問說明天川普會說什麼就我們還是先因為我們還是講說客人都一直提醒我們不要speculate不要去想說未來會發生什麼事你先專注在當下因為當下就很多事情要處理了對不對那如果說你當下就可以最好的一個應變目前的一個狀況你才有餘力去對應未來可能發生的一個狀況所以我們還是先聚焦先把當下做好對我們因為相信我們的客人都非常的聰明那也都很清楚是說他們盡量是不要傷害他們自己的一個利益就是American first所以在這樣的一個角度下的話你就不應該去擔心剛剛這件事情發生那問一下你剛剛有提就是美國當地沒有辦法做基金的領域這個是嗯嗯嗯衣服是一個勞動力密集可是附加價值有非常低的一個產業你想想看你其實你件衣服你要穿個十年不換也可以啊或是你想要每天都換一件也可以沒有什麼這不是一個什麼戰略性物資啊對就有或沒有就了不起就光著繩子這樣子也也沒差吧就是這不像鋼鐵或這一類的呃唯一可能需要在美國當地生產製造的衣服大概就是軍用的衣服軍用跟醫療用這兩個東西這兩個是戰略物資是沒錯可是除此之外的全部的東西並沒有一個什麼我覺得是說可以高大上到說必須要在美國製造而且確實就是說啊我們剛才講就不是單純成本問題那為什麼嗯非洲就沒有人在做衣服非洲成本已經是最低的對不對所以你單純從成本這件事情無法解釋說為什麼現在衣服沒有一對的非洲人在那邊做原因就是說成本只是一個單一的考量還有很多的考量就是剛才講的一個濕度啊環境啊跟氣候啊穩定度啊。

This also affects the stability of the cloth. This leads to a quality that says the last output. Asia is the right place to do these things. Because the environment in Asia is actually the right thing to do. So this is not to say that it is easy to move to the United States.

You have to overcome it. And it has taken a lot of experience. As a result, you transfer something that you add to your own. You can see that you actually see that even in China made clothing is also a Western industry. It is not their strategic goal.

So, don't say they don't want to do that either. They want semiconductors, cars, new energy, and some industries that are more strategic. The clothes are always the most labor force, then the cost is relatively advantageous, and then make a stable place to move. After you understand this, you won't worry too much about saying that the U.S. will rob the workers of the United States of America again great into the people of sewing clothes.

That's a relatively low price. That's not to say that uh would be a job for a new client. Because we both have clients that should be turned out, some of the products that stay in some countries still have so-called high tariffs are very high-end things that people imagine are different. Because uh orders have been moved to these places in Southeast Asia for years.

That said, it's easy to say that you're doing more expensive things in Southeast Asia or that people in Southeast Asia can't do these two things. If the low added value was taken away by Bangladesh long ago by the Indian Sri Lanka who was robbed of that person, then more and more, the er is good at doing clothes right there. So if the add value is low, there is no technology that has been doing this for years.

So we thought we should have a chance to get this piece of erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic erotic

So we think that moving or moving is the right thing to do, but it is not possible to evaluate the impact of this movement. Therefore, guests are very careful that they are not willing to talk about this thing, but from our point of view, it is that as long as this urgency to a certain degree or more to move, or just to say that the best place to move, where to undertake how much technology to undertake, etc., this is still in communication. Because everyone must choose the best place, it is not always possible to think about that Indonesia after 90 days, but suddenly this is not a waste of 90 days, so everyone has a consensus is that the move is right, but it is probably waiting for the strategy to decide which direction to move this is to talk about.

This is why we believe this shift is definitely much easier than most electronic industries. It's just that the one who doesn't have the time to know exactly which one is the right fit. So now we're all playing it. Well, if we're all going to stop paying taxes this year, we're going to increase the cost of this last year. Because the biggest fluctuation in Southeast Asia this year is salary. Because the recruitment process is increasingly difficult and this payback service is relatively high this year. But we've adjusted a wave of salary at the end of last year.

So there is no extra cost for this year. So we have to look at the last two issues that we open up about the time. Well, because the time is almost the same, we have to open the last two problems. First, let's ask the question because uncertainty is very high, the distribution of the second half of the year is the next dividend rate will be very high, and we tend to adjust eh basically according to the logic of the past, that we don't want to put too much extra money in our hands and haven't explicitly used the method of effective use. So if we don't see the obvious opportunity, or try to return to shareholders with the logic of the past is what we're going to do.

So that can be the tendency to say that if the second half of the year looks at the probability, or if the eh may open the photo without too much change, it should be back to shareholders. Just mention that the industry is now at 60% of the open eh where you bought it, the eh you mentioned just now in other parts of the region where you bought it, if you say that this year these areas are open to 60% of the public.

In fact, it is impossible to be in Vietnam. In just three years it has grown to more than 60%, which is a data from last year, so it must be around 80% this year. If you want to say that you have increased this ratio, as long as you are working over an hour a day, this output is not too big a problem.

Now that it's almost half over, maybe more than seven percent, there's nothing too much to worry about. It's that Vietnam already has enough capacity to localize, and there's a lot of capacity to provide global services. Well, thank you.
