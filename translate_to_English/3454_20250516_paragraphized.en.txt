<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcriptions and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the fragments of the transcriptions provided to see how to reorganize these time-seated sentences into consecutive paragraphs.

This section should be combined into a natural paragraph, which may need to be arranged in order of each timestamp corresponding sentence, but remove the timestamp while maintaining the order of the sentence. For example, starting with "all online advanced", followed by "all at noon", then the company name and activity name, and then introducing team members. This should be noted that each member's position and name are correctly correspondent to ensure that the information is accurate. Next is the speech section of the general manager.

For example, in terms of revenue growth, the phrase "Jinrui Communication 2025 consolidated revenue of NT$19.7 billion, an annual increase of 25%" was merged into a paragraph with subsequent explanations. Then, the financial data explains that there are a lot of specific data and percentage changes that need to ensure that the figures and units are correct. For example, "the portion of revenue is 25% year-on-year, the quarter-by-9%," etc., the data needs to be accurately presented while maintaining the original structure. During the process, some non-Chinese content, such as "confronted", "guardians", etc., may be incorrect input or speech recognition errors.

For example, if a sentence cannot be intertwined with a previous sentence, it may take a separate paragraph, but it must remain the same. In addition, the textualized sentences provided by the user have some time-stamped sentences that may belong to the same paragraph, such as the part about the exhibition: "March to Japan International Security Exhibition, April to participate in the world's largest U.S.-West International Security Technology Exhibition, May to participate in the Taipei International Security Technology Application Exhibition", these should be merged into a paragraph that illustrates the company's participation in different months.

In addition, some sentences may appear uncoherent due to speech recognition errors, such as "confronted", "guardians", etc., but according to user requirements, they must retain these contents even if they appear uncorrelated. Finally, it is necessary to check the coherence and logic of the entire paragraph-based script, ensuring that each paragraph is transitioned naturally while strictly adhering to the principle of not deleting anything.

Let us first introduce the management team of today: General Manager Liu Zhenqi, Spokesperson and Director of Global Marketing, Mr. Xie Bangyan, CFO Li Meiyu, Executive Vice President of OEM Business, Mr. Chen Xincheng, Deputy General Manager of Brand Business, Mr. Cheng Shengfu, Acting Spokesperson and Design Verification Office.

The first question is about what you are looking forward to this year, and the general manager will explain it for us.

In addition to the Vortex of the hybrid cloud, we have a new project with a visual language model, introducing a VOM to our existing AGE AI products, and accelerating the development of serial channels and technology strategic partners. That is why we are optimistic about the future of AI. Next, we will discuss what the company is looking forward to in terms of regional market growth momentum. The main markets of wafer communication are in North America, and the markets outside, including Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America, are full of potential for development. These areas are dedicated to developing smart cities, smart transportation, and smart factories on the supply chain.

In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of AI and cloud technology, through innovative research and development to fully meet the needs of market demand and customers. These are also in response to our focus on software and shipping services, hoping to reduce the impact of tariffs on emergency sales in the future. The next question is about the company's capacity in Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

Our current goal is to make about 60% of Taiwan's production capacity overseas. But the next question is whether the company will set up production lines for U.S. production or other low tariff areas, and the general manager will answer the question. For our largest U.S. market to produce locally, the cost of production will not actually be as great as the cost of the IT industry, and the cost of local production is not necessarily advantageous.

Thank you to the general manager for answering our questions. We have received your questions and will reply in 5 minutes. Thank you. Now we start to reply to your questions. Next, there are advanced questions about which U.S. products are currently shipped from which factory, please explain to us.

Our main sales in the overseas market, which is also in the OEM part of the FOB Taiwan quotation is not affected. As for the brand products sold around the world, we still maintain the existing gross profit. Therefore, we will make dynamic adjustments to the selling part. In the future, we will continue to look at the policy and the direction of market trends to make a rapid impact.

The following is a summary of how much tariffs affect the company's gross profit margin. The general manager explains this. Today's communications such as the exclusion of timely adjustment of supply chain structures in accordance with the conditions of the country of origin, allow the company's products to be marketed in a competitive tax burden to other countries in the United States. At present, our goal is to maintain gross profit. The impact of tariffs is currently limited under this policy adjustment.

The overall effect is not great.

In Taiwan's IT OEM industry, the situation we encounter is similar, the impact on gross profit is very large. In fact, the situation we encounter in Taiwan's IT OEM industry, the situation we encounter is similar, the impact on gross profit is very large. In fact, the situation we encounter is similar, the impact on gross profit is very large.

As for the price increase, we aim to maintain our gross profit, and as for the fees we propose, this is a way of looking at the situation around us, and our channel customers to make dynamic adjustments. As for customer acceptance, there is no problem, this has been a full communication, the customer also a considerable understanding, and the current tariff policy changes. The next question is about the recent exchange rate change of Taiwan Dollar, please ask the U.S. Supreme Court about what the change in the profit-making of your business is.

Please ask the U.S. Congressman what is the change in the profit-making of your business. The general manager asked us to answer this question. Just as we have explained in advance, at present, we are in the exchange rate operation or natural avoidance, and in the overall environment, I believe that we also see quite unstable exchange rate changes, so we actually, especially in the quarterly report to see that there is no big impact. As for the change in profit-making of the current profit-making, the change in the profit-making of the current profit-making is still under control, please explain to us.

In the last quarter of last year, we were in the back-end monitoring and management software, as well as the current hybrid cloud Vortex cloud service, which we are actively promoting, and we are in the process of upgrading. In particular, Vortex currently has a five-fold increase in connectivity compared to the same period last year, so it is now a significant increase in R&D or product launch, or channel promotion. Thanks to the general manager for the answer.
