We are honored to have Mr. Lui Guqin, Chairman of the Longcheng Hotel, and IR Rita come to check on the securities. With your investment brokers, we share the company's operating schedule and outlook for the future. In the next time, we will first pass to Rita. Thank you for your participation today, and I am an investor, Mr. Sun Fengying.

The last part is the future. The company's products are robust, whether it is possible. Industrial mobile computers provide built-in GPU rugged computers. The company's revenue momentum continues to grow with high growth in AI and rugged robotics applications. But with AI-related solution layout and applications continue to expand, the company proposes corresponding software and hardware integration solutions to launch solutions for rugged products and edge AI computing platforms.

In addition to layout, Longcheng stores have branches in the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan, China and other places. Last year's revenue was $95.59 million, gross profit margin of 40%, net cash equity ratio of 34%. 52 sales channels, 612 employees, RB accounted for 169. In 2024, revenue of $30.58 billion increased by 17.7 billion.

Now it's all right to say that at the stage of the conversation, let everyone know that he's not fast enough, and he may be more than a year away from the process. We want to say that in this field, we can do the cheapest, and the fastest, because I found the world, for example, Europe is now in the military industry, so we have a customer, should also be a customer, is also a competitor, has been working with him with Taiwan's peers, he announced in October last year, he is no longer a large water product, he is now all focus in the military products, because with the increase in the future national defense budget, so he announced, we see his shares, he is a German company, he bought more than two hundred, every day, so said the future of the market, but bugger knows that I see his lot, because we are friends, so he knows, I said, you, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, there is not much, the same, the two million projects in hand, he is in hand, he should be here, we should be the same, we say we are, we are, we are, we are the we are, we are the we are the we are the same, we are the same we are the we are the same we are the we are the we are the strong we are the same, we are the computer, we are, we know know know know, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the same, we are, we are the we are the same we are the we are the same we are the same we are, we are, we are the same we are the same we are the same we are the same we are, we are the same we are the same we are the same we are the we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the next, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the three, we are, we are, we are the same we are, we are the three, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the three, we are, we are, we are the three, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the If you want to know more about us, please contact us. If you want to know more about us, please contact us. If you want to know more about us, please contact us. If you want to know more about us, please let us know. If you want to know more about us, please contact us. If you want to know more about us, please let us know. If you want to know more about us, please let us know. If you want to know more about us, please let us know. In every field, our Leadership position compares to the Mature, because now you're not T1 T2, you can't.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and sort it into a paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how to make a reasonable segmentation while keeping the timestamp correctly mapped.

First of all, I will check the corresponding sentences for each timestamp in a row to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the first sentence is [959. 88-961. 88], so this is probably the case, and the next one is [966. 88-967. 88]. This should be noted in the interval between timestamps, and some sentences have time to jump between, for example, from 961. 88 to 966. 88. 88, which may mean that the speaker has to pause or skip some parts.

At the same time, pay attention to the correct handling of technical terms and terminology, such as "aming", "igation", "ses", "po HI", etc., these may be internal terms or spelling errors, but the user requirements do not rewrite, so it is necessary to retain the same. In addition, the terms referred to by the user may be misspelled or informal terms, but the same needs to be retained. This may affect the reading fluency, but according to the user's instructions, no modifications can be made. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the correct position of these terms and does not alter their order or content.

In addition, there are some technical discussions in the verbatim that the user provides, such as the controller, the tops, NVIDIA, Intel, etc., that need to maintain the order and structure of the original sentences to ensure the accuracy of the technical details. For example, the performance comparison and power consumption of different processors must be arranged in the original order without any deletion or merger. In the process of finishing, it is also important to pay attention to the logical relationship between the sentences and put the relevant content together, but must strictly follow the requirements of the user, without adding any connection words or modifying the sentence structure. For example, the discussion of the next five years of the controller needs to keep the order of the original sentences, even if there is a jump between certain sentences, keep the original.

If there is uncertainty, it may be necessary to check the original verb again to make sure that each timestamp and sentence are correctly presented correctly. </think> The following is the collated paragraph verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated verbicated: -- [959. 88-961. 88] So this is probably not the case. [966. 88-967. 88] This is because frankly speaking. [968. 88-970. 88] This is because we have something to write about.

[970. 88-971. 88] Write it a lot. [971. 88-972. 88] My guests will see it. [972. 88-973. 88] Competitors will see it. [973. 88-974. 88] It was a pleasure to see it. [974. 88-976. 88] Now I feel that internationalization is too serious. [976. 88-978. 88] They did not care about it.

[988. 88-991. 88] This is our aming power. [991. 88-992.1 88] Because I don't have an Igation. [992. 88-994.8 88] We clip it well. [994. 88-995. 88] We are familiar with the main. [995. 88-996. 88] Who's browsing. [996. 88-997. 88] We fucked.

[997. 88-998. 88] We are browsing. [998. 88-999. 88] are all 1 are verd√§s. [999. 88-1012. 88] We are ses. [1012. 88-1013. 88] We are po HI. [1013. 88-1016. 88] We are still on the phone. [1016. 88-1018. 52] It is a month of our capacity.

[1018. 52-1020. 52] We have at least 20,000 or more flats. [1020. 52-1022. 26] Now almost 25,000 flats. [1022. 26-1023. 12] But almost. [1023. 12-1026. 58] I think it's not much of a ratio. [1024. 58-1026. 46] It's about a thousand flats. [1026. 46-1027. 86] This may be my unit price.

[1027. 86-1029. 40] I think the unit price seems to be a bit bad to say. [1029. 40-1030. 36] Because of our rivals. [1030. 36-1031. 60] Also know how to deduct. [1031. 60-1032. 52] I found it now. [1032. 52-1034. 36] I will talk to everyone for research. [1034. 36-1035. 04] I will not do this.

[1035. 04-1036. 36] We have to keep some energy. [1036. 36-1037. 40] Because we have a lot of competitors. [1037. 40-1038. 54] He will go to school. [1038. 54-1040. 14] Learn our business model. [1040. 14-1040. 78] But [1040. 78-1042. 50] But I think we go fast.

[1042. 50-1044. 40] But it is also appropriate to keep some. [1044. 40-1046. 08] That we have that privacy. [1046. 08-1049. 68] To be able to keep our business model. [1049. 68-1051. 48] This comparison is long lasting. [1051. 48-1052. 06] That is basically. [1052. 06-1052. 96]

[1052. 96-1054. 82] It is now the amount that I can speak more and more. [1054. 82-1056. 46] and we are now in control of whatever. [1056. 46-1058. 56] It should be said that we speak. [1058. 56-1059. 56] This drone. [1059. 56-1061. 36] I will not talk to you now. [1061. 36-1062. 70] It is purely a drone.

[1062. 70-1064. 30] It may be a drone ship. [1064. 30-1066. 60] It may be an unmanned armored car. [1066. 60-1067. 56] The small booth. [1067. 56-1069. 40] Even the unmanned car. [1069. 40-1070. 38] It is the one we are now. [1070. 38-1071. 54] It is mixed together.

[1071. 54-1072. 58] So I collectively called it. [1072. 58-1073. 60] Robotic [1073. 60-1075. 34] It is no longer called Drum. [1075. 34-1076. 08] Because Drum is. [1076. 08-1077. 82] A little too much Nano. [1077. 82-1080. 08] We now have a lot of Drum applications. [1080. 08-1081. 72] It is used in agricultural applications.

[1081. 72-1082. 72] Agricultural monitoring. [1082. 72-1084. 72] This is a very broad application. [1084. 72-1086. 06] There are many such applications. [10886. 06-1086. 56] Yes. [10886. 56-1087. 76] So this tells us. [1087. 76-1089. 06] This is the future.

[1089. 06-1090. 12] Flying in the sky. [1090. 12-1091. 00] Running on the ground. [1091. 00-1092. 56] There is also running on the sea. [1092. 56-1093. 50] All right. [1093. 50-1095. 06] So it has more control over it. [1095. 06-1095. 94] But I think.

[1095. 94-1097. 60] This Controller is the case. [1097. 60-1099. 30] Everyone would think you should use the Controller. [1099. 30-1100. 14] Because you are basically. [1100. 14-1101. 00] If all are self-driving. [11010. 00-1102. 00] You can do it yourself. [1102. 00-1103. 70] Some degree of Controller is said.

[1103. 70-1105. 58] It can provide any one person. [1105. 58-1106. 82] You can see the image. [1106. 82-1108. 02-1109. 92] So its efficiency is high. [1109. 92-1111. 52] And it also needs to be high. [1111. 52-1113. 22] You are just like MPK.

[1113. 22-1115. 36] It has only six Tops. [1115. 36-1116. 82] basically runs. [1116. 82-1117. 92] Like Intel. [1117. 92-1119. 20] Like Core i7. [1119. 20-1121. 60] Like 13 generation is too small. [1121. 60-1124. 46] But it is too powerless.

[1124. 46-1127. 16] So this is what it is. [1127. 16-1129. 20] Similar to NVIDIA is more feasible. [1129. 20-1130. 50] That is, it is also power consumption. [1130. 50-1132. 08] This is also a kind of. [1132. 08-1134. 00] Because it is the same as Core i power consumption. [1134. 00-1135. 58] So we are now looking forward to it.

[1135. 58-1138. 18] Says that Core i is of course better. [1138. 18-1139. 98] It is the highest use of ten tops. [1139. 98-1140. 82] OK It can be used. [1140. 82-1141. 92] It is only expensive. [1141. 92-1144. 32] We are looking forward to that MPK. [1144. 32-1144. 92] It is the next generation.

[1144. 92-1145. 86] It is now. [1145. 86-1147. 70] It is like this week to participate in the war. [1147. 70-1148. 62] Does it have to work with us. [1148. 62-1149. 70] It is the next generation. [1149. 70-1150. 90] It is going to release in June. [1150. 90-1152. 94] The new it is a dozen tops.

[1152. 94-1155. 44] Can be a simple speaker for the GPU of NPU. [1155. 44-1158. 36] I think it is more suitable for us to use. [1158. 36-1158. 94] That is the point. [1158. 94-1160. 08] We can look at the front end. [1160. 08-1161. 80] This is the front end of your running.

[1163. 34-1164. 78] You can see it here. [1164. 78-1165. 58] And it will automatically. [1165. 58-1167. 18] That identification. [1167. 18-1168. 82] Also it will be hidden. [1168. 82-1170. 48] It will automatically walk its path. [1170. 48-1171. 38] It will not hit anyone else.

[1171. 38-1173. 62] This time I also used more. [1173. 62-1175. 32] But for a long time. [1175. 32-1177. 26] Actually this controller. [1177. 26-1178. 10] I am present. [1178. 10-1180. 30] After 5 years. [1180. 30-1181. 46] It is not necessary.

[1181. 46-1183. 04] That is, every one is independent. [1183. 04-1183. 80] and then protect himself. [1183. 80-1184. 94] This is our next generation. [1184.11186. 74] Be quick to develop new ones. [1186-1188. 14] After that, everything is going on. [1188. 14-1189. 30] Similar people walk on their own.

[1189.

The following is a re-routing paragraph verbatim:. The growth of our future is the highest. For now, I think it is more important because as we increase our revenue, medical is also increasing. It is our main Key Account, which is all in the increase. The logistics industry because we have recently had a new logistics customer to sign the ODM, so this is also in the increase.

So the point is that its price has been greatly reduced, this is the focus, because the German automotive industry is no longer as competitive as before, their cars are not good to sell, it is impossible for me to make money, so we will probably have such a structure adjustment. Good thank you. Then there is the AI function, and then there is the chip IC design in our country has not been developed, and the development time is at least two years or more.

And it has some unprocessed order, that backlog order is already on our system, so I think little has changed, that is, there is little that I think it may be expected that it is really deploy. That is, there are some allocation problems should not be canceled, just say that the issue is how much it is. Right, the future is that the Ministry of Defense propensity to say that you have been approved, they can directly negotiate the price. So now is one-to-one, assuming that I'm looking for A company, you haven't got a label before, but you're in history, and I'm looking for you, so they'll talk to each and talk to him.

It's not just Taiwan, it's even more like the United States. So I think that the general purpose of such a low-priced application should be large, but it's a big one. I'd rather say that we have to compare the development of relatively high gross profit or it's difficult to have good EPS to do a lot of money, and that's probably the case.

In particular, because I don't know much about your problem, that's because they're probably 8 percent, right, that's what we're going to do if we want to pull it to 10 percent, right, that's what we should say. We talked about why this company would sell because I'm very familiar with his father, and in fact he should say that he's a second generation, he's coming to Taiwan, and I know that he's coming to Taiwan because he's a second generation, and he's a second generation, and he's just saying that he's not going to sell the company, he's just saying he's going to sell the company, he's going to talk about a price.

So he can, so I'm going to send him back to Switzerland and he's going to talk about a larger OEM case. So we think that in the future we can get in touch with a lot of big customers in this field, then the cost of using Taiwan will make us more likely to do business. Because now, I earn 35%, he makes 40%, that's not possible. He can do this very well, but now there is no such thing as an 89% business in the world.

So I think that if we were to hold them for a year, because they are two very smart people, one is unique, their company's IT is made by both of them, so smart schools should be terrible. So basically he is our silversmith, I remember, right, yeah, yeah. He's all of us, it's the best companies in the world, the best companies in the world, the rest it's hard, no they're good, that's right. So he wanted to join me in this company, so the way I gave them, I wanted to bring some new IT to their country, such as AI or Nobatic, or this Taiwan's manufacturing capabilities, to their country, or Smart City concept, so they do so. So basically he's the reason why he's investing is because he can see at least a billion-dolity, but I think he's really good, and he's going to see real business, so he's doing, so he's doing, so, so he's that he's money back, so, so it's a lot, so it's a lot, so it's a lot, so it's not, so it's a lot, and so it's like that's like that's a country.

We have just mentioned that G-Share has an open platform here, and then I want to say, is this platform we have a so-called partner, or is this platform the business we operate with, or is the profit model, thanks. This is basically what we are talking about when we are using AI depending, that is, if we are using OpenLino in Window, if you are on Linux, he is P-Touch, it is similar to this Plan in development. Basically we are doing one thing for him, his generation, and then there is a good after that, so we can't talk too much about his relationship with him, so we've got a few cases going on and working together that's probably the thing. This platform basically means that he's not what I'm talking about Robotic, he's probably Drone, he's probably a moving car, that's a drone, and that's probably an application.

As Harry Wei did a lot of warehousing logistics, he was a department, almost a billion dollars, the other he had control center, he did the type of aerospace or military use, so this accounted for almost 80%. He recently split into three companies, then he is the logistics company to be independent, then, of course, in the future is the logistics independent, is with us Wemade cooperation is the main, basically, there is no other partner supply chain, it is probably so so I think will increase, just say that we now increase revenue, because we wait for May and come in, we also have changed, so now there is no way to give you too much new, you say yes, yes, it is probably so.

It is not true, because if you show up, you will jump a lot, right, we're going to see this year, so if you lose the Swiss price, that's what we're going to do this year.

It's the original industry. The growth rate is probably how much. That's what I can say about it. There are also two figures for growth in the first half of the year.

So I can't say too much. Too much to say is bothersome. The correct answer is that there are two or more numbers to grow. There are still more to deducting this purchase. This is probably the case from the German point of view.

Car inspection this tablet. Maybe it is not so high after growth. Like us. There are HBCs involved in Japan. Syscon This company is actually in the market in Japan. There is not yet.

See the obvious results. After that, what kind of target customer group will it be? Will there be a Japanese factory? This is the one. We participate in Japan because it is a high-speed computing company. It is called High Performance Compact.

So basically its customers. That is, it was the last time I talked about it. It was dedicated to doing it. It is the largest distributor of Supermicro. So it is dedicated to calculating those.

Or Medications. The recipe of the Lord. It is a supercomputer. It is similar to Taiwan. They are called High Performance Compact.

The other part is the bracket. Like it can also have a lot of brackets. So we are now actively working on this all in platform. That is to sell it. So this will increase our business. The interaction with it is probably the same.

But we should be in the future. With us. Gina partner company will. Increase its shareholding in this company. We want to say we have more. We are the people of this group.

There are more than three-quarters of the company. There are majority more than three-quarters. Because this June. I am the director of their board of directors.

It is possible to have more than this size. The way before, in fact, the lair view... There is a design chip. That's a set of.

It's an eccentric animation. So it's a Virtual View. There's also a theme. Change it to Hueiss. See. Kiryu transforms Arthur.

Can you tell us about the competitive landscape? You just mentioned the beginning of the long-term part or the sword. What is the competition?

Competition pattern. Because I think right now. Because we say, for example. We generally talk about robust computer. Generally, it is theoretically about notebook. Only talk about notebook, but our company is just talking about strong.

Rugged computer. We are basically not notebooks, we are notebooks and tablets. There are PCs, we are all called Rugged.

This rugged computer, so we're more comprehensive. So we're talking about, I'm just saying. Panasonic may be the first. That's what we're talking about, it's using Rocky's notebook.

If you look at VDC report, you will see that the first one is Panasonic. The second one is Dair. The third one is Metal Defense. AB is processed.

And he said to them, 'This is what the Lord says: 'Let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go.'

We compare diversify. Our portfolio is quite simple. We don't compare, but we are now. In this field, our products are now very well. So we are. We have a great opportunity to meet you.

Then there will be more competition, just say that we want to be. Good competition. Probably, but we also have. We are in this product line at GCS. We are in this field. It is a role that is more dominant.

We should be relatively dominant in the tablet. Because our tablet should be. The second largest in the world. In terms of quantity, this is probably the case. So the biggest is Zibor. So we have some in this field.

There are some. That is the basic strategy of thinking. With logic, so we just said why. Say that we want to merge again. We are not necessarily a wheel. It is not a Taiwan Highlands company.

It is a foreign company, because we have to have a business together. It is possible to do business with it, or it is in-Custom. This is probably a logical thinking. This is the future of us.

Strategy, we would like to say in this field. We are at least the first two. This is probably the case. **Please note:** **Please note:** **Please note:**

Here's a re-arranged paragraph verb: OK, we're going to ask. We're going to ask. Let's ask. In other areas, such as Czech, Australia, India, Poland, the virus in these areas probably hasn't changed since we've done it all in Korea and Switzerland, because we've done it all in South Korea and Switzerland. What's the rest of the country?

That should be said, because we want to be like Advantech because there are 29 offices like Advantech. So now we have 7 or 8. In theory, we want to change 15 in the short term. So we have India already set up, that is, we have already done it. That is, he is back in Taiwan. So I want to go to India to open an account, that is.

So Australia will do the same thing. Australia will do it, but it may be slow in our ranking now, because after all, it's still business. So of course, Europe is the main thing now. So the United States, because of Trump's factors, there are a lot of variables. The United States is basically good because we have a lot of Warehouse and base in Asia Pacific.

And then it wasn't too difficult to make in the United States, because we had a plan for years before. Like Europe, we wanted Europe to end the war in Ukraine slowly. In Europe, we would have more Play. That's less de-emphasize U.S. tariffs. That's probably something to think about. But Southeast Asia will also think about.

Only Southeast Asia, like Thailand, is also a chance, but we have a lot of it in the future. South Korea is now more focused on shipbuilding. Our cooperation with Hanhua in Korea, of course, will be relatively large in the early days. If this IT solution works with better ODM, I think there will be a lot of progress.

I think that Taiwan now has the IPC industry as we have basically gone out, and we have the money, and we have a lot of partners in Europe, and he is a country that can work with us. So basically we should not have too much of a problem with resources.

That is to say, we can do a lot of business without our customers. This is probably the case. The production capacity of the company is not clear, because just mentioned that American cooperation like the United States can not enter production. So now the company is in every industry in Europe, now we all have a 390 line in Vietnam. We also hope that in Thailand, because I saw that we have a manufacturing company in Thailand.

So we want to say Thailand. But that's my pilot, and that's a lot like saying that if I bought a factory in Thailand, it would be 100 million or more than 100 million. Now we have our scale, because we can make my investment in Taiwan almost as much as we did in Taiwan.

This is probably the case. Because we're probably buying a pre-tax fund seven times, we're talking about the above standard to see the price, but don't buy too much. But I can't because it's so embarrassing that I'm talking to him how much I'm buying so everyone knows he's not going to tell me how much I'm buying and who's even going to run away from the media in a foreign country. But this is the process we're talking about.

If you ask me about Liu Dong he first complained about you so stupid ebit to talk to him, I would say that only talk about who is so stupid ebit to talk to him because of his future so I don't think you want to talk to someone talk to you so there are many ways to talk to him so there are many ways to talk to you so there is no one in the future so this talk has a lot of focus, or you interact with him you think he's going to buy something safety in the future, because I think I'm 100 percent on my risk or too high, so I've found a partner that I think it's better. But I found this partner who can help me generate business so I think it'm going to be.
