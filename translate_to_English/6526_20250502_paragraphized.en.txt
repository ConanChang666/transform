Dafa Technology investor relations. The gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2025 was 51.7 percentage points, a decrease of 2 percentage points compared to the previous quarter, and a decrease of 0.9 percentage points compared to the same period YY last year.

In the long run, we continue to strive to optimize our product portfolio. If we exclude a one-off return, the long-term goal has not changed. Hopefully, the gross profit margin can be maintained in the middle of 48 to 50 percentage points. The following is the portion of the operating fee. In the first quarter of 2025, the operating cost was approximately NT$196.3 billion, a decrease of 2.7 percentage points, an increase of 25.1 percentage points compared to the same period last quarter.

In recent years, the development of key products and technologies, including widescreen products to 25G 50G, Bluetooth audio chips continue to evolve into more advanced processes and photocommunication-related products are also being developed towards 100G. All these require the development of the corresponding personnel and resources. All investment and capital applications have been subject to a variety of trials and adjustments in market conditions. The following is the portion of the operating profit margin for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 66.7% compared to the same period last quarter.

This quarter's earnings growth is better than a revenue increase. The operating profit margin portion of the first quarter of 2025 was 14.1 percentage point, an increase of 2.1 percentage point compared to QOQ, an increase of 2.5 percentage points compared to the same period last year. The net interest rate portion of the first quarter of 2025 was 13.6 percentage points, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to the previous quarter, an increase of 2.9 percentage points from the same period last year.

In addition, there is no special one-time program for revenues and expenditures outside of the operating profit margins of the quarter. The last one-time program is EBS U.S. stock earnings. The U.S. stock earnings in the first quarter of 2025 were NT$4.36, which increased NT$0.6 from the previous quarter, and NT$1.9 from the same period last year YY.

Executive Vice President Violent Spokesperson John Tse explained the company's operations and outlook for the future. We thank you for your support. The first quarter of DABA's revenue was solid, with a combined revenue of NT$5.2 billion, up by 36.5%, up by 8%, compared to the previous quarter. In the first quarter, the main growth momentum came from the following areas:

At the same time, the consumer applications include Bluetooth audio and satellite positioning chips, because of the early shipment of tariff uncertainty customers, and the increase in business headset-related products in Bluetooth audio chips, plus the new Bluetooth audio flagship chips released at the end of last year. At the end of February, we shared with you that DABA's revenue reached a record high last year, and this year's revenue is expected to continue to grow.

The other two core product lines account for a relatively large network widescreen revenue, which is expected to maintain steady growth this year, and Bluetooth audio products continue to focus on the development of high-end products and optimize the product portfolio. In terms of widescreen products, the current 10G POM market penetration is accelerated, and the next generation of 25G POM 50G POM is in the layout.

In addition, NETVIGATOR products require collaboration and interoperability testing with operators, forming a highly sticky partnership that also raises the entry barrier. In addition to its product iteration technology and evolution, NETVIGATOR Wi-Fi also absorbs our company's Wi-Fi network to provide the lowest power consumption solution in its class, in line with the needs of first-line operators. Over the past few years, NETVIGATOR has continued to grow its European customers.

In the future, more than 50 FDA-certified hearing aid products will be introduced to update the economy. In terms of market demand, with the introduction of multiple language models, the application of 50G and 100G Sturdy technology, the product demand is much longer than expected. Delta is the supplier of the core telecommunications store of Pump4DSP, the direct customer is the optical model casino, and the mid-term customer is the cloud service provider CSP.

This year, the main growth momentum of the product comes from two directions. First, the existing technical single channel 50G-30 customer base of Pump4DSP continues to expand, and second, the peripheral combination amplifier TIA.

Use the TIA converter. It is expected that this year there will be a chance to start shipping with the main chip DSP.

On the other hand, the single channel 100G-30 technology is also under development in our planned blueprint. Finally, the Ethernet product line. Delta is currently in the field of Ethernet. There is a Five, which includes the physical layer, as well as the Ethernet switch. The product line currently has a relatively low revenue ratio. The revenue ratio is relatively low.

There is a lot of growth space. We continue to make good use of group platform resources. At the same time, we combine AEON SEMI's 10G-5 technology. The opportunity to integrate with Delta's 10G-5 and the MediaTek Wi-Fi platform.

First of all, the network infrastructure business. Also known as a limited business. It covers two main product lines of widescreen and Ethernet. Revenue represents 30-35 percent. Main kinetic energy comes from widescreen products. Increased market share in Europe.

Combined with the Ethernet product line. Fermented with the synergies of the Group's platform. Driven by revenue growth. Next is a high-end AI IoT business cluster. That is, wireless business cluster. Covers two product lines.

Bluetooth audio and satellite positioning. In the first quarter of 2025. The business segment accounted for 50-55% of revenue. The main growth momentum comes from Bluetooth audio.

Increase in product shipments. And some customers are uncertain due to tariffs. Drive overall shipping momentum.

In addition, the product portfolio continues to be optimized for high-end applications. Further enhances product value. In other areas of business. Photocommunication PanPoDSP. Starting in Q3 2024.

Also from the third quarter of 2024. Also included is Jiuyang. Hejiding and two product lines. The first quarter is a part of year-on-year growth. From last year.

No Jiuyang and Cellabox. At the same time PanPoDSP. Products benefit from customer base. Expansion leads to an increase in shipments. Strong growth in the first quarter. New products are still small in revenue.

The company will continue to present stable season-to-season. The company will continue to present stable season-to-season. The company will continue to present stable season-to-season. The year-to-year growth.

We are constantly monitoring the changes in the market. Do what we can, and dynamically adjust the situation. Make the best resource allocation. Here is my description.

Thank you Menghan. Next is the Q&A time. You want to ask the investment advanced. In the text dialog field at the bottom right of the screen. In the text dialog box at the bottom right of the screen. Select Ask All Answers.

Enter the company name and question. The company asks the question on behalf of the company. Thank you.

First of all, the first question is. Ask about the impact of the U.S. tariff policy on the operation of Daba. The main thing is to understand the proportion of Daba revenue shipped to the U.S., and Daba through the ODM plant in China. The proportion of shipments to the U.S. is a global issue that everyone faces.

Facing external changes. Daba has been concerned. Constantly communicate with customers in a timely manner. And internally simulates various possible scenarios. Planning needs to be adjusted in response. As mentioned earlier.

Daba's product layout is quite diverse. By comparison of consumer areas. Gaines satellite positioning. There is also the construction of a network communication unit. A wide screen of cooperation with carriers. There is an ongoing expansion.

Globally. External environment changes are inevitable. DABA is planning its future strategy. External risk of change has always been taken into account. We strive to do what we can. Focus on maintaining a deep relationship with our customers.

The next question is, ask the company to mention earlier. Q2 revenue is expected to maintain growth in the quarter. Ask the main growth momentum and why.

The company has continued to see. Because of the demand for early pull. Looking ahead to the second quarter. We expect to continue the quarter-to-quarter. Year-to-year growth trends. Main kinetic energy comes from widescreen and Ethernet growth.

First, broadly understand that products continue to expand in the global market. Europe shipments are steadily expanding. The Ethernet section. The group's cooperation projects are in progress. Coupled with the higher expansion of 16POP or 24POP. Switch shipments increase.

At the same time, Delta is also the field of low-track satellites. The main supplier of Ethernet products. As demand increases, revenue growth is also driven. But of course, recent because of the overall environment.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim fragments of the user and organize them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

For example, the user mentioned "with global policy full of uncertainty" followed by "we will continue to closely observe", and the two sentences should be combined into a natural paragraph. I need to check if there are duplicates or areas where the order needs to be adjusted. For example, some questions and answers may be divided into multiple timestamps that need to be grouped together in a consistent manner. For example, the user is divided into multiple timestamps and I need to integrate them into a complete answer paragraph. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency between timestamps. For example, the user is divided into multiple timestamps and I need to make sure that each part is connected correctly to form a complete question and answer process.

In addition, some sentences may belong to the same topic, such as questions about stock repurchase plans, need to merge the associated timestamp into a paragraph. During the process, also pay attention to the punctuation symbol and the convergence of the sentence. For example, some sentences may end with a comma or a sentence, and need to determine whether a comma or a punctuation or a punctuation is needed according to the context.

For example, there are some timestamps in the segment provided by the user that may jump, for example, after [1139. 62-1140. 66], it is necessary to check whether these timestamps are continuous and whether the order needs to be adjusted. However, depending on the data provided by the user, timestamps are arranged in order, so you should keep the original order. Finally, to ensure that each paragraph is converted naturally without missing anything. For example, the part of the exchange rate impact, the user has to be divided into multiple timestamps and needs to integrate them into a continuous paragraph while keeping the contents of each timestamp intact. In summary, I need to check the contents of each timestamp, which are merged into paragraphs of the same topic or the same question, ensuring that no sentences are missing, while keeping the original order and content.

This requires careful reading and logical judgment to ensure that the final paragraph verbatim text is both in line with the user's requirements and is easy to read. </think> The following is the collated paragraph verbatim text (fully retains all original content, adjusts the markup and paragraph structure): We will keep an eye on the uncertainty of global policies. The next question is: Is there a partial U.S. tariffs in place to suspend the implementation, or is there a possibility of regular taxation, or is there any adjustments to the order?

The next question is about the field of photocommunication. Don't you know that companies have seen the supply chain of photocommunication-related products, because the tariff war has changed between China and the United States?

First of all, in terms of the competitive landscape, the mid-term customers in this field, i.e. cloud service providers, have high infrastructure requirements, and supplier support is also very important for customers. The main competitive advantage of PanPoDSP or G-SERVICE related products in Daba is energy saving, customer support flexibility, etc. Of course, external changes to the overall competitive landscape or the impact of the supply chain need to be observed. The next question is: Do you want to ask the company if there is a stock buyback program? I am Anson, I answer the question about the stock.

We continue to promote a number of large-scale plans and product development, this early content has been mentioned, and has been mentioned several times, mainly focused on more advanced processes and advanced technologies, and are continuing to progress. For each investment and cost, we have a much more in-depth evaluation and planning.

In the first quarter of 2025, the gross profit margin is 51.3%, mainly due to changes in some product portfolios and the help with the return benefit. From a 2025 full year perspective, our intention to keep stock rebounds may not be as significant as 2020's. If we exclude the help of a one-off return benefit, the company's long-term target gross profit margin remains the same at 48 to 50%. The next question is about supply chain issues: achieving strategic advances in product lines in recent years, especially Bluetooth audio and satellite positioning chips, which continue to evolve into more advanced processes.

In the future, we will continue to focus on the development of AonSemi, a company that specializes in Tengi-5 technology. As we have just completed the integration of investment, products and technology, our goal is to provide a temporary solution to our customers with the development of TengiPo products and Wi-Fi products developed by M8.

The next question is the relatively large exchange rate change in the US dollar, can you understand the impact of the fluctuation in the US dollar exchange rate on the company's profit and loss? Hello, I am Anderson, the exchange rate risk is actually a large change in the situation of the outside world. There is a reference to TSMC, because just some people have asked, and TSMC also announced that it will reduce the operating rate by 0.4 percentage points. I think the change in the industry is that the company's revenue and this receivable are denominated in US dollars, so theoretically this can achieve natural avoidance, that the revenue is the US dollar is also the US dollar.

So, in theory, it is possible to achieve a natural avoidance, but in fact, he will have some effect on OPM. In fact, the expense of most of the company's expenses is mainly based on Taiwan dollars, for example, we use most of the user's expenses, which is the proportion of the company's overall operating expenses is the largest. So, in summary, not the entire operating expenses are denominated in US dollars, but rather the relative cost of most of the expenses are mainly Taiwan dollars. In the case of such a combination is indeed a depreciation of the US dollars, the appreciation of Taiwan dollars will have an impact on the profit here, but not greatly.

The next question is L'Oréal's audio-related questions: for the OTC residential hotel related products price is relatively small, the person you trust realize, non-reserve tab way also makes it easier for consumers to access.

[1595. 20-1597. 00] Want to know whether the OTC-related products are squeezed to the market of traditional medical and residential hospitals, whether they are on demand or product price. [1597. 26-1598. 54] Or will not affect the willingness of brand customers to cooperate with the development. [1599. 04-1603. 90] The trend of global aging, the number of people affected by the English-speaking population continues to rise. It is also necessary to see such market opportunities. [1604. 16-1608. 00]

[1609. 28-1611. 08] However, the range of hearing loss groups is very wide, ranging from mild to severe. [1611. 58-1614. 40] The introduction of OTC products mainly provides a convenient choice for mild and moderate hearing loss patients. [1614. 92-1618. 76] The corresponding products will also be differentiated according to hearing loss. [1619. 06-1621. 12] Back to Dart has been in the field of hearing for many years, in addition to supporting non-primary OTC hearing aids, there are traditional medical-grade technologies. [1621. 12-1622. 72] Last quarter and all reports that we have mass-produced over one million hearing ICs by the end of 2024. [1622. 72-1626. 76] As of the year so far, we have also released more than 50 FDA-certified hearing-related products.

[1626. 76-1631. 84] In order to enhance the consumer experience, as well as with aesthetics, Delta cooperates with customers with a variety of shapes, including sensory, comma, neck-hanging, suitable ear-hook, etc., to meet different situations and preferences. [1631. 84-1636. 54] The brand customers also began to recognize the importance of noise reduction function on the hearing aids, including an effective disinfection and maintaining a good sense of environmental sound. [1636. 54-1639. 34] Noise reduction technology relies on algorithms and processes, and Delta's AI has been working on projects for many years. [1639. 34-1642. 80] The next question is a wide-screen-related issue, and Chen Chun mentioned earlier this year's wide-screen communication products are expected to grow steadily. [1649. 06-1652. 34]

[1652. 34-1655. 74] There are two main types of household gateway devices, one is called SFU, Simple Family Unit, which is more simple, it only contains the light part of Pong, does not include WiFi. [1655. 74-1658. 42] For example, the back of the iron door, because the WiFi signal is easily blocked, most of the SFU devices are selected. [1658. 42-1662. 54] Then, through Ethernet, in the room with a pure WiFi AP share. [1662. 54-1666. 92] Another is called HGU, Home Gateway Unit, which integrates Pong and WiFi function, which can provide wireless sharing directly via HGU. [1666. 92-1671. 38] This is an integrated solution, simply speaking of SFU and HGU.

[1677-1683. 86] mainly meet the needs of operators, some operators will need Pong plus WiFi, some operators do not, it depends on the operator's promotion strategy. [1673. 86-1675. 96] The next question is about operating expenses, I want to ask the company's view of the 2025 annual operating expenses. [1677.1683. 78] In the first quarter of 2025, the operating expenses increased by an additional 25%, of which the overall costs were mentioned earlier, most of them were in the user's expenditure, including the portion of the salary of the salary, and the portion of the bonuses and variable dividends, which are called user expenditures. [1683. 78-1685. 40] The company is still continuing investment and expansion phases, and the company's products and the technical development plan of talent needs, which we continue to increase, and the related expenses will also increase. [1685. 40-1688.] On the other, the first quarter of the year, the combination of the first quarter of the year will not include a long-year, but also includes a long-long-term growth.

[1688. 041-1691. 80] However, from a year-round perspective, we have maintained the previous quarter with you to mention that the expected revenue growth will be greater than the target of this year's expense growth. [1691. 80-1695. 44] The next question is about optical communication issues, earlier mentioned that TIA can be mass-produced this year, so do you want to know whether TIA mass-produced practices and shipping will be shipped with the existing product ESP? [1695.195. 44-1697. 32] Do you want to know if TIA's mass-produced's mass-producing's mass-produced's main DSP's main chip?

[1707. 10-1712. 48] In general, the market size of DAB's Bluetooth audio services is about 1 to 2B, and the main mid-range applications include TWS, e-commerce sub-offices. [1712. 48-1717. 60] In terms of market size, TWS is currently the largest application, followed by the sub-offices, and then business and e-commerce. [171717. 60-1721. 18] Currently, DAB is the highest application in the market of DAB's TWS and e-sports after many years of more technical and product names. [1721. 18-1724. 00] With a stable relationship with its customers, the world's top three suppliers in the business headset segment, the demand for noise reduction is very high, which is also part of the high. [1724. 00-1726. 82]

[1734. 74-1737. 08] The next question is also a matter of operating expenses, and DABA looks to have a number of new products and new technologies in progress. [1737. 10-1739. 40] If the time is extended, you can understand the company's future R&D expenditure planning. [1739. 40-1741. 96] What should we look at, such as changes in the proportion of future product costs. [1741. 96-1750. 16] The operating expenses part of DABA is likely to continue to grow, so.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request and organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that the sentences corresponding to each timestamp are understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

For example, the first timestamp is [2108. 76-2110. 54], and the corresponding sentence is "this followed", and the next time it is [2110. 54-2114. 38], "the parentheses have a relative relationship". It looks like these sentences may need to be connected, for example, "this has a relative relationship with the parentheses", but the user does not require any rewriting, so it must be kept as it is. Next, I will check in a way to check whether there is a break between timestamps, for example, after [2185. 60-2190. 20], a question may need to be segmented.

In addition, you need to pay attention to the interval between timestamps, for example, after [2361 12-2364. 44] there is a question that may require segmentation. At the same time, some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, such as about part of a photocommunication product, and need to be consistent. During the process, you also need to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, without adding any connection words or modifying the content. For example, keep the order and structure of the original sentences when turning from one question to the answer.

This includes checking if any of the sentences are accidentally deleted or merged to ensure that each timestamp and sentence is accurately presented. </think> [paragraph verbatim transcription]: This is relative to the size of the mastery revenue. So in the short term, it is not recommended to consider the operating cost as a stable number. If this is a question of whether the mid-term period is long-term, the R&D cost of R&D in the first quarter of Bitaba Technology accounts for about 80% of the total operating cost, so it is equivalent to about 1.5 billion yuan.

The Delta in the middle is a value that we do not want to see in this direction, so you can calculate it yourself. That is, at this stage, the company continues to focus on providing higher-value products to customers, focusing on the scale of revenue, hoping to improve the growth momentum of long-term competitiveness. The next question is the widescreen issue. Do you want to know the share of revenue in the company's network area?

In the past few years, we have been adopted by a number of first-line operators, and many projects have started to generate revenue. As mentioned earlier, the market of this network is relatively slow, but it is robust, and we expect the growth of the revenue share of TengriPone. The next question is inventory related issues.

Looking for a company's current inventory level? Check out the first quarter of inventory axis rotation days. The first quarter of inventory axis rotation days are 77 days, a decrease from the previous quarter 94 days. The amount of the inventory Dollar has also decreased from NT$2.3 billion to NT$19.900 billion.

The next question is the question of gross profit. Can the company provide more information? For example, the change in gross profit margins for each product line in the first quarter of this year? This part we can share that the gross profit margin of the two business groups is not very different if the company's average level of target is 48% to 50%.

The next question is about Opto-Communications. Have you mentioned this year's growth momentum in Opto-Communications? Part of it comes from the growth of new customers? Looking for Opto-Communications products that currently represent the company's revenue?

In the field of opto-communication, customers who ship directly to the end cloud service provider are module plants and then to the end cloud service provider. This year, with the expansion of the customer base, we have the opportunity to serve new cloud service providers through the new module plant. The market share of opto-communications is small, but we have recently observed that with the introduction of several large original models, our existing technical product needs of 57Service are more sustainable than we expected. We will continue to work closely with our customers, co-service end cloud service providers, and strive to achieve a faster 100G service as soon as possible. Our long-term goal is to maintain the share of this product line in the hope of the future, to reach the current share of revenues like Ethernet or Microstar positioning.

This year, the company looks to be one of the major growth drivers of the company's revenue growth. Want to see how this year's revenue share of Ethernet products and the change in gross profit rate? Over the years, the company has actively invested in the field of Ethernet, including investment nutrition, private equity, and investment AE CM, to expand its product line and technology capabilities. In terms of product, the physical layer of Buy chip is widely used, and the low-track satellites of routerless, TV switch IP telephony monitoring system are used.

In the future, AEON Semi will be able to work with MAC WIFI and the 10G POM solutions to provide business solutions. Overall, the expansion of this area is a very important professional goal, and our goal is to optimize the product portfolio in the long term. The next question is whether we want to improve the growth of widescreen products in various regions? And in the past quarters, we have mentioned that European and American NETVIGATOR customers and Design expect to see significant revenue contribution.

As mentioned earlier, this year, we saw an increase in demand in the Asia-Pacific region, and the European first-line carrier's plans are moving forward as planned, and the second quarter is expected to continue with such efforts. This year, the growth of widescreen products will come from Europe and work closely with MediaTek to expand its portfolio. The next question is Optical Communications. Can you understand the competitive landscape of TIA products since Delta plans to start mass production this year?

What is the competitive landscape of DAB's products? What are some of the competitive advantages of DAB's products? In the past, there were some stand-alone TIAs available in the market, the advantage of DAB is that we started with existing customers, followed the main chip DSP, and our DSP itself has also integrated Laser Dial Driver inside, a full set of chip solutions, saving customers time to adjust and launch their products.

Anderson has mentioned that our product range is about three, in terms of growth rate, this year should be more than the limited product range, which will be larger than the limitless product range. The next question is light communication related issues. Recently, there is a lot of discussion on the CPU common package technology, and what will be the impact on the company's Panfor DSP-related products, how to deal with it?

As I mentioned earlier, we observed that the market demand for 50G is far longer than expected, we also mass production of new module factory customers in the first quarter, and we have mass production of new module factory customers in the first quarter.
