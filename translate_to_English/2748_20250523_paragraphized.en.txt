Welcome to the Summer Forum, the second quarter of 2025 held by China Yongchang Securities. It is our pleasure to invite the Chairman of Yunping Sheng Zhiren. After that, Mr. Tseng Jinghong, the Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Hui Hui Hui Yu. Next, we will hand over the microphone to the chairman of Sheng to share this experience with you. Thank you, everyone.

I think I'm going to jump right into the topic. Because we've been together for a while, we're pretty familiar with it. I think I've just taken a little bit of a closer look at what I've been talking about before. Maybe I'm more focused on something that might have changed in the past. I also want to leave a little more time for DQA. We can have more discussion.

I think about the company's profile section. Of course, the company mainly includes clouds and then averages. I think we're all familiar with this and I don't spend more time talking about it anymore.

Then change the snack area to a private room. The purpose of this is, of course, to say that the amount of consumption on the one hand of the private room is a little higher. Then, on the other hand, we are more efficient in controlling the distribution of services. I think it is helpful for our operations.

So last year there was a little bit in this section that affected the operation of the mover. This is a more special thing. Then we went out to eat. Actually, we have been developing. We are apart of military goods, business goods, we are commissioned to run outside.

Whether it's a meal or a stay. In fact, we have some new developments. I'll take a look at some of them. We moved the trade union to Abu Dhabi to open a restaurant. It was opened in 2026. It's now, I see the whole renovation progress in the first two weeks.

It's just like fire. It's under renovation from the beginning. It's not even a detail renovation. Or at this stage of building a house. So in 2026, we hope this year can open as scheduled. It looks like progress is in line with expectations.

So we created a military connection last year. We are more familiar with the military connection. We position it in the catering entrusted operation. That military connection is a place to stay.

Some of these places have accommodation, some include accommodation and food, so you can see that we have been here for the next two years.

In the next two years, we will continue our operations in the military connection land. The idea is more and more. Our Hangzhou preparation is also next year. The first quarter is expected to start operations in the first quarter.

It has been preparing since 2019. I remember the first time I saw this scene. It was the end of 2019. Then I saw the scene is a piece of land. Then I started to build a 45-story building. Then they went through the pandemic in Hangzhou Asian Games.

It's actually a very hard process. It's next year. We hope to start the trial operation in February next year. Then we use the Italian theme to do the theme of this hotel. That's to put the four cities of Rome Florence Venice and Milan together. Each two floors is a featured theme.

We can compete in this market. We are able to have a completely different position with others. We are able to follow this style. It is probably not on the market at the moment.

So we wanted to use an entry point like this. Then we went to run Hangzhou cloud products. Our location is right next to the Qiantang River. Our window is the Qiantang River. It is a great place to see the tide. Then the military connection.

And we know that it is as if we were in the Garden of Eden, and that it is the Garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden, and that it is the garden of Eden.

There is also a buffet restaurant where breakfast is served. Then this hotel is located in Nanxte, Taichung. We actually took a lot of this kind of restaurant management. There is also a fruit market in Tainan, and then the Taichung House just opened at the end of last year.

Then he went to the south, and the east, and the west, and the west, and the east, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the east, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the east, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west, and the west;

Then, the size of it may not be large, yes, cloud, or cloud, we never pursue.

We want to say, a characteristic point. Slowly stack up. The time is longer. It will.

We're on the market. We're on a different road with people. We're not very focused. The size of the volume. We want to slow down our quality. We use our quality to separate ourselves from the industry.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Our program allows guests to come here without leaving Taipei. Whether it's a private party or a wedding banquet, this program can meet the needs of guests. This program has already included high-level services like Lexus.

So we started selling this project in June this year, selling it in full, and then operating in July. This project is a new case in Chiayi, which covers a large, almost ten hectares, right next to the South Palace of the Palace. It is equivalent to a fully man-made lake, made 32 villas, in the middle of the small island and next to a villa, each has its own swimming pool.

So it is a very special 32 villas, each villa has a swimming pool. This project we like to like to create a very characteristic, and there is probably no competition in the market. I hope that there is such a thing on the market that will connect it slowly. It is a good development for us in the long run. Fuxing hot spring has also signed a contract, Fuxing hot spring has a thousand pings, covered with six villas and outdoor banquets.

This is why we all see the numbers of 2024, and then 2025, I just reported to you that so many of these will continue to open this year, plus next year, especially next year, Hangzhou is a big point. After a big point in Hangzhou, we may not add all the small points. So this will also contribute a lot to our future revenue. So I think that one of our development directions is very helpful for the long-term solid growth of almonds.

The biggest benefit of commissioning operations is that even if Taiwan is developing again today, or coming back to a pandemic or having a shock, commissioning management is actually making money, and we don't have to bear the risk of it. Like a pandemic in the past, the old hotel in the past said that we have to take the practice of uncompensated and unpaid wages. The company's spending in that crisis will actually be larger and more stressful. Now, I think that different owners are responsible for this failure. So we are helping to do this, we are fixed, not fixed, we are the percentage. So for us it is said that there is no risk at all.

And then let's be able to expand this in a short period of time. Of course, we also choose carefully, in fact, we say the truth is to reject a lot of invitations to work with us. Because if we find this point not too characteristic, we would rather that our manpower and time are limited and not really willing to pick up a lot of cases.

Another case is that if we don't have any special additions to this connotation, if we simply want to say that there is no risk, I think we are less likely to evaluate these cases with this attitude. There are several cases that are currently discussed, there are several cases, and a few, and this scale is actually growing more and more.

Let's have some improvement in costs in the first quarter of this year. So the business gross profit and net profit in our first quarter is a little less than last year. Here I can say that half of the factors are one-time or half that we ourselves are going to notice some increase in costs.

So we also need to be better and more effective in managing our own costs. This is the first quarter. The biggest difference we can see in our housing rate in the past is that the military has been hit by the pandemic. And then, as the pandemic started to slow down every year, so we recovered to a situation close to the pandemic in the past year.

In fact, we want it to remain around 70% and we want to maintain a 70% housing rate. So we are constantly able to improve our service quality and then make our guests happy. This is the condition of the entire housing rate. The average room rate continues to rise. You can see that in fact, this first quarter of this year has been more than one percent more than last year's average room rate.

This year, I have to be a teacher, and I think it will be a tough year for me as a whole to visit Taiwan. That is because international tourists do not come back so quickly.

So it's not like the media says that Taiwan's tourists have been traveling abroad all the time. I can't report a number, everyone is more clear. Last year's number has been announced, and Taiwan's tourists travel about 17 million, more than 17 million. This number is a little less than 2019, but last year's number is a little less than 2019, so it's not generally what we see in the media.

I think this is the reason why foreigners do not enter this thing, and I think it is simple to explain. So I think we will continue to promote interesting tourism, this is our core value. On this topic of fun travel, we will continue to promote. I also report that this week, we just sent the Harvard Business School MBA students, we have made a very special cooperation with them.

We started working with them this semester last year, and we gave them a few questions, asking them to use cloud products as an example, and then researching how interesting travel can do better. Then they studied a semester, and then they flew to Taiwan last week, spent a week in Taiwan, visited 40, including our guests, our colleagues, and we were not our guests, and we didn't come to cloud products at the time, but we wanted to understand why he didn't come to cloud products, which is the reason behind the background.

We have made a lot of changes, because in fact, we have been told that it is a European castle design style, this style is not suitable for business travel, because business travel here to work at night, maybe the light is not enough, so for us, we simply positioned ourselves as a resort hotel. So what did we do? We let our guests have breakfast at 12 o'clock in the morning, he can eat unlimitedly, without having you go out to eat outside before 7 o'clock in the morning, you just have to come back before noon to eat a meal, this we don't really care. I think it is to make guests happy, have fun, then we want to say that the slow spirit of Italy, go out of the vacation, the most regret is that you have to pick up the alarm clock for breakfast, even the alarm is not to worry, is that you can be easy to come to come to take a leisure vacation.

We are now seeing that there are no other hotels in Taipei that we can follow up the breakfast to 12:00. But if you have more than 50 restaurants in Taipei and have lunch, you probably won't be able to do this because we are basically sacrificed, we don't have lunch in the afternoon, so you can let your guests eat at 12:00. We didn't have a buffet lunch, so for us, the cost of this conversion is not that big, so we can do it, and this person is not very easy to follow up. So I want to use this way to help us follow up on, let us and others can see the difference.

This is the first time that we have been working on this real estate in Italy, and it is now being renovated and then we want to say that it is a complex property, about two years later it is estimated that in two years, it will bring us the benefit of this investment. Our encouragement policy has always been strong, that we have been using this, we are relatively high proportion to give cash incentives, this is our consistent policy, in addition to the year of the epidemic, we have had a little bit less, the other we are very stable, to give this encouragement. Then we will continue to work on a number of levels.

We took part in this sustainable award for the first time, and then we got the first prize of this talent development, and then we are the second overall performance, in fact, we are the smallest company in the competition, we just passed through the threshold of the vision, we only two billion turnover, cloud level, but in the end, our competitors are billion turnover, compared to the home's decimal point is not the same, but our performance is in the sustainable above is really positive. We also strive to create this model, cloud in September last week three days, and then three months after the week of the test, we decided to turn cloud three days into long measures, so we want to let this kind of policy, it is the most straightforward, it solves the job of our colleagues nearly zero, and then this resume increases ten times, and more than ten times, and more importantly, I talk to tell them that they are a lot of what they are a strong feeling or not a lot or a lot of a lot of their work. This is the first time we have received this vision for the first time this year, got a thousand five, each year, but did not get the first prize, is the first breakthrough, and then we also participated in this award in Asia, also got a lot of achievements, the sky, this year has not been announced, these awards are not to mention, I think our core values, is the orderly culture and art, innovation and social outlook, we will work hard to implement these, we do business, while doing this we think we are worthy of the value, we can put it into our work, I think this is our purpose is to say, hope the company has good value, guests also agree with our value, colleagues here because we can practice these values, make it even more meaningful, this is a goal that we can go on long-term.
