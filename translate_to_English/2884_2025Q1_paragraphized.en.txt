I am Mr. Chen Maoqing, the general manager of Yushan Financial Holding, who is a member of the Board of Directors of Yushan Financial Holding. Today, we are the second headquarters building of Yushan Financial Holding, and we are going to be in this building for the first time. That is because the relationship of light gives us the outside curtains, otherwise we can see from the outside there is a very beautiful scenery.

In the first quarter of 2025, a briefing on the first half of the legislature. First of all, in terms of the overall economy, due to the fact that the policy of peer tariffs has hit the global economy, and then brings a lot of uncertainty. That is, IMF has first lowered the rate of global economic growth, which has also been affected by varying degrees of influence in countries, such as in the United States, where the GDP growth rate in his first quarter has changed negatively, and has become somewhat conservative in the previous years.

In terms of the overall situation of Yushan Financial Holding, the total assets of the financial holdings and banks reached 4. 1 trillion yuan, and in terms of our net net worth per share was over 16 yuan, 16. 47 yuan, it also shows that Yushan is a profit to support growth, we have an increasingly solid basis for this capital. In the first quarter of the financial business, the return of the two leveraged ratios and the capital capacity of the financial holdings remained at a good level. In the first quarter of the financial business, the first quarter, the return was 21.3.4 billion yuan, and the net profit was 87 billion yuan, the growth rate was very good.

In the first quarter, the absolute number of transaction fees was 7 billion yuan, which grew by 12.5%, and the transaction fee income was the highest record in the year. The transaction fee income grew by 18%, while the transaction fee income of the credit card grew by 8.8%, especially the credit card spending amount of $1364, and the new high record at the same time. The highlight of several important operations in this quarter, the first is the encouragement policy, in March, we have passed the May release of May shares by the Board of Directors is 1.3 yuan, which includes cash 1.2 yuan and 0.1 yuan of the stock. At the same time, we also made some announcements for our future Yushan's incentive policy, so the distribution rate of the high cash incentives is the principle of the future Yushan's incentive policy.

When we look at the profit structure of FHC and its subsidiaries, the bank's profit ratio of the first dose is 94.5%, in securities is 4.8%, and venture capital is 0.7%. When we look at the growth rate of the right hand side, the bank's growth rate is more than 50%, and the performance is quite good. In comparison to the profit structure of the same period last year, Net Revenue Net Revenue net income growth rate is 22%, the growth rate of the OPEX is 10.4%, and the profit growth rate is 40.6%.

The following table shows the transaction fee income, the first dose of which is 7 billion yuan, which contributed 50% to the wealth management, followed by the credit card and securities economy and corporate loans. Then see this growth rate on the right hand side, the credit card transaction income growth rate is 8.8%, and the wealth management is 18.2%. Then we further see the transaction fee composition of the wealth management, you can see that on the left hand side of the two main products are insurance and mutual funds, which accounted for 40%, quite stable.

In the second payment season, we also expect that in the second payment season, Yushan's wonderful years of this activity, in the past few years, the amount of credit cards can reach more than 10 billion yuan. We are also looking forward to a substantial increase in the amount of Yushan's spending in the second quarter, and the average US dollar's spending amount can be seen in the second quarter. In Yushan's securities, the net after tax rate in the first quarter has slightly decreased, mainly due to the decline in the volume of the market.

When it comes to overseas business development, the profit ratio of overseas sub-line in the first quarter is 26.5%, however, the annual profit growth rate for the first quarter of this overseas sub-line is 17.8%, which continues to grow staggeringly. Although the profit ratio of overseas sub-line last year was over 30%, it looked a little lower, but in fact, it only saw the absolute amount.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments, convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions, and have to keep all the original content without deleting or rewriting. First, I need to understand the specific requirements of the user: each sentence in the transcription must appear in the final result, cannot be omitted, cannot be merged or summarized. The user has given an example, I need to refer to the format of this example.

First of all, I will check the raw data provided. The raw data is a list of timestamps and sentences in units, for example [516. 52-519. 32] The annual growth rate of its profits continues to grow. My task is to rearrange these separate sentences into a coherent paragraph, each of which is made up of relevant sentences. It is important to note that the user emphasizes that there is no need to delete, rewrite or condensate anything, so it is necessary to make sure that each sentence is kept in the final version and in the correct order.

Each section seems to be independent, but needs to be grouped by topic. Then, I will check whether there are sentences that belong to the same topic or need to be sorted in chronological order. For example, multiple sentences about deposits and loans (such as deposit amount, growth rate, NT$ and foreign currency deposits) should be put together to form a paragraph.

In addition, it is important to note that the sequence of timestamps is correct to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, in the raw data, timestamps start from 516. 52, followed by continuous increments, but some sentences may be disconnected due to theme switching. It is necessary to ensure that the sentences of the same topic are sequenced at the time of conversion, even if the timestamps have a jump. At the same time, it is necessary to deal with the continuity of some sentences. For example, sentences [537. 24-560.42] and [560. 42-562.98] appear to be discussing different types of deposits, but need to confirm whether they belong to the same paragraph. Similarly, the sections of NIM and Spread need to combine the relevant sentences to form the full paragraphs.

In addition, to process possible oralization and repetitive content, such as the "Q&A Manager" and the introduction of the director's sentences, ensure that these content remains consistent after conversion and does not affect reading due to repetitiveness. For example, the presentation director may need to combine multiple timestamps of sentences into a smooth paragraph. During the processing process, also pay attention to the correct representation of digital and professional terms, such as "YOY", "NIM", "LDR", etc., to ensure that these terms are properly explained in the context, but not to add explanations as required by the user, only to keep the original. Finally, it is necessary to check if there are missing sentences and ensure that all content is arranged correctly. For example, from the start to the last timestamp [1016. 30-1019. 50] and the subsequent Q&A content needs to be fully presented.

1. Read all sentences and understand each part of the topic. 2. Group the sentences of the relevant topic and form the paragraphs. 3. Arrange the paragraphs in logical order to ensure that the sentences within each paragraph are coherent. 4. Check for missing or wrong sentences. 5. Make sure that all the sentences corresponding to the timestamps are correctly classified. 6. Finally read the whole paragraph script to make sure that there are no omissions or errors.

In the future, we will continue to expand our service network overseas. We have now approved Toronto Branch in Canada, Mumbai Branch in India, and Dallas Office in the United States. We will continue to grow our business in major deposits. The total deposit amount is $3.41 trillion, which is 10% growth rate compared to the same period last year.

Among them, international deposits grew by 4.6% and foreign currency deposits by 11.5%. The total amount of deposits was 2.36 trillion and YoY's comparison was 10.7%. Among them, NT dollars had grown by 9% and foreign currency deposits by 18.7%. YOY's growth in corporate loans was 12.3% and personal loans by 9.8%.

We remain cautious and optimistic about this year's growth goal. In terms of the structure of the loan, 2. 36 trillion yuan of the total amount of the loan, the picture on the left can be divided into about 50% of SMEs, large enterprises, and overseas sub-banks. On the left is consumer-related, which is about 50% of the purchase class of mortgages, personal money transfer mortgages, and uninsured personal credit.

The LDR in foreign currencies is gradually steady growth, reaching 38.3%. For this deposit, the right-hand side is the deposit structure of the Yushan, see On the next page is the trend of NIM and spread. In this quarter, the NIM of Yushan is 1.3% flat, and the spread is 1. 33% higher than the previous quarter. This is mainly due to the impact of the U.S. dollar interest rate drop, so let the interest rate on loans slightly lowered a BP.

This is the ratio of the NPL of the product line, which is the ratio of corporate loans and mortgages, as well as market comparisons, are maintained at a very good level, see below. The next is the cost efficiency ratio. Since the return performance in the first quarter is quite good, so the CI ratio of Yushan can be seen as stable, up to or below 50%.

As of the end of 2024, both the financial controls of Yushan and the Bank of Yushan maintain a very solid and strong capital level. The above is the first quarter briefing. For the Q&A running team, please run the Q&A manager. Thank you to the Q&A manager. First, I would like to introduce our executives at the chairman table.

The first quarter of our Yushan Financial Holding's profit was 87.900 million and the growth rate was 40.6%. Today we announced that the profit in April was 25.100 million. Today, the profit in the first four months of the combined four months is 113 million. The profit in April is less than the profit in March, which looks like a negative growth, but in fact, we all know that April is a month more dynamic and more confusing in financial markets.

We have also seen the impact of this on profitability, and we think it is acceptable, after all, to assume that he is more than 2.5 billion. That said, if you look at the first quarter, the profit of Yushan Financial Holding in the first quarter is the fourth in the financial control, and the absolute gold is the fourth in the final. In EPS, ROE, ROA, ROA are the single-season highs that create our Yushan Financial Holding.

In the first quarter, our funds and insurance will account for 40% of their income. In particular, insurance, we want it to be able to increase the insurance's income when it is more volatile to the financial markets, or when it is more volatile to the capital markets. That's our goal. That's true, we've been at a high monthly rate for two consecutive months in March and April, and that's how insurance works.

In the past year and year, I have highlighted that insurance is becoming more and more important to us. That is, in fact, the profit margin for overseas branches is 17. 8% growth in the first quarter of this year. That 17. 8% profit margin is 40. 6% of our total profit margin. However, 17. 8% profit margin is over 70% in 2023 and 14% in the first quarter of that year.

But we just said that our overseas profit ratio was 26% in the first quarter. That was the same as it grew by 18%. So the answer is that the domestic profit growth rate is faster than the growth rate of overseas profit. That was 32% of our overseas profit ratio last year, but 26% in the first quarter of this year, and we thought it was satisfactory because it was also a driving force to maintain high growth.

In addition, in the first quarter of last year's fourth quarter, we were unable to report the fact that we were ready to bid for the Baoding Investment. Later, on March 18th, we obtained a stake of 91.2 per cent on long-term equity investment in Baoding Financial Holding with 2.7 billion. I think you all saw this clearly on the media, and the main impact on the Baoding Financial Holding is not much. Our current progress is to officially apply to bamboo network authorities. The delivery date we estimate is July 1st, which means that the Baoding Investment itself will not affect the first half of the financial report, but the second half will have an impact.

There will be a year-round impact for the next year. I think that's the part of integrity. Also in the last part of our legislative session, the next part will be detailed by the management team for each of your questions.

** Paragraph-based transcription (without deleting any of the original words)**. Not a good news yet. Regarding Moodle for the Bank of Yushan Financial Holding and Yushan Financial Holding. An inverse to improve the credit rating. It is now A2 and A1 respectively. They are both private financial controls and private banks.

The highest and poorest level. So I would like to say this is a very important news for Yushan. So above I would like to briefly explain some of the points.

Hello, this is the same security here. Ask yourself the first question is because of some recent international economic issues. It is tariffs, stock market declines and fluctuations in the currency. And we do not know that we will not change the guidance for this year.

The credit cost will then persist. It may be a bit flat or down. These guidelines will not change.

And the second question is, because the market is relatively volatile, I want to ask you to continue to the month of May, here is a dynamic energy on the financial income, see how the situation is observed. Then the exchange rate such a big fluctuation, what kind of impact on the transaction income is, is positive or relatively different from each other. Above, thank you, ask three questions. And I want to help you do a start.

And then I asked the Chief Financial Officer to explain it first. Hello everyone, I'm Wu Hongbin, head of the financial industry. That's why I'm going to give you a statement of our opinion on the overall environment. Because of a tariff on the whole of Trump, he's in a phase of a treaty. So I don't know, so the current situation is relatively uncertain. So let's look at his impact on the entire economy.

We are not sure what the future will be. If we look at the U.S. from the U.S., the first economic rate is negative, but he is mainly speaking of the increase in imports, just that his unemployment rate or the new opportunity data are still good. His unemployment rate is still low right now. So we look at his overall situation, we can also see that he is still looking at the situation, because he has no past experience, so he may have to look at the fact that the U.S. economy as a whole can afford the manpower, or the speed of what he has to endure, so he is also in the outlook.

If we look at Taiwan from the perspective of Taiwan, we see that Taiwan's first dose of economic productivity is 5.37%, and the relative performance is good. At the moment, we are still observing a situation of the entire tariff, because at present Taiwan's tariffs are not in the semi-conductor side of the tariff, waiting for the U.S. to announce what his plan is, so the impact we still have to look at, may not be so fast. So what we see now is that the whole situation is not good right now, just that the future may be affected by the whole international situation, which may have some impact, which may be the place we are going to look at in the future.

The exchange rate is from 33 to 32 to 31, which is not very much for the part of us that directly affects us. Because we mainly have the disadvantages of assets and liabilities, the disadvantages are relatively balanced. If we look at the surplus, there are a few: the first is the interest income of our foreign currency, because he is a foreign currency; the second is the interest income of our investment bonds, he is a foreign currency; the third may be like our handling fee, foreign currency or foreign currency, like TME foreign currency, which may have an effect after decomposition of Taiwan currency.

So this has a very positive impact on our flow trading or profit. First, the second is that after the exchange rate has run like this, he has made many exporters a little nervous, so it is a safe requirement, so the amount of the client wants to do this to avoid the real needs of him suddenly exploded. So the total amount of the TMU Hedge is quite large, so in this regard it is quite positive for us, so I probably supplemented here, thank you.

But it's probably in the middle of the mid-late, with issues like that coming up in the next 90 days, and...

[1462. 38-1462. 82] Yes. [1463. 54-1465. 78] Negotiation is that countries are gradually negotiating. [1466. 78-1468. 54] The outlook is OK. [1468. 78-1471. 54] That and recent economic data are relatively good. [1471. 54-1473. 66] In one case, the market is relatively stable.

[1473. 94-1476. 26] We have a whole sales momentum. [1476. 26-1477. 22] Some better. [1477. 54-1477. 94] So. [1478. 98-1472. 02] Time on the spot to see the future of the entire market. [1482. 02-1483. 34] It is not easy to predict. [1483. 34-1486. 06] We are cautious about the entire investment product.

[1486. 06-1487. 54] [1487. 98-1490. 34] That's what we've just been reporting about. [1490. 34-1492. 02] We say that we are currently. [1492. 70-1495. 30] The structure of the product is probably fund and insurance. [1495. 30-1496. 66] About 40% of each. [1496. 66-1499. 42] So we continue to add to the dynamics of insurance business.

[1499. 42-1500. 58] We just mentioned it. [1501. 14-1504. 66] The overall energy of insurance in April is also true. [1504. 98-1505. 78] Gradually up. [1505. 78-1509. 74] So we will keep on pondering some of the business of such insurance. [1509. 74-1512. 18] The hope is that the market will be more volatile. [1512. 38-1514. 10]

[1514. 10-1516. 18] Able to keep our business as a whole. [1516. 22-1516. 74] Above. [1517. 38-1519. 34] Have other supervisors to supplement it. [1522. 02-1523. 54] I add a little to it. [1524. 34-1526. 78] In terms of the prime minister's economy variables. [1526. 78-1529. 86] Greater impact on commercial banks is interest rates.

[1529. 86-1532. 54] The exchange rate is quite small. [1532. 54-1535. 38] Just as we have said to the Chief Financial Officer, the impact is not very big. [1535. 38-1537. 94] How we calculate the impact is not very big. [1537. 94-1541. 50] The volatility of the exchange rate is huge. [1541. 50-1543. 22] was at the end of last year. [1543. 22-1544. 82] The overall economic impact of this year.

[1544. 86-1545. 94] At the end of last year. [1545. 94-1548. 50] For this year's forecast of the overall environment. [1548. 86-1553. 30] Is that the fluctuations in the interest rate exchange rates will be particularly large. [1553. 62-1554. 54] But. [1555. 26-1557. 26] Especially if the exchange rate fluctuations are high. [1557. 26-1559. 34] This is done for commercial banks.

[1561. 90-1561. 22] Services. [1561. 42-1563. 66] have a positive impact on our revenues. [1564. 10-1566. 34] It is just not for a long time that his duration is prolonged. [1566. 58-1568. 10] Because the price fluctuates greatly. [1568. 10-1570. 26] When the Range is quoted, it will magnify. [1570. 30-1572. 50] It is also due to volatility.

[1572. 54-1574. 34] So that the volume will also be enlarged. [1574. 58-1577. 14] So there is a benefit in every aspect. [1577. 58-1578. 98] The second is financial management. [1578. 98-1580. 22] As we have just said. [1580. 42-1578. 02] It is still good for dynamics to date. [1584. 50-1587. 46] It is a bit unexpected.

[1587. 90-1588. 82] That is true. [1588. 86-1591. 14] The performance of our communication is quite good. [1591. 62-1592. 38] In addition. [1593. 18-1595. 74] This is the growth of the money. [1595. 74-1599. 22] 10% of the estimated and the growth of the financial management two numbers. [1599. 46-160. 30] We have not yet adjusted.

[1601 50-1604. 14] We still do not say the adjustments up and down. [1604. 46-1607. 58] Because so far we can all get it. [1604. 46-1607. 58. 1611. 22] In particular, loans are slightly slower than machines. [1611. 22-1613. 54] But we believe that this year. [1613. 86-1615. 30] What we have so far seen. [1615. 30-1618. 22] It may still be that goal.

[1618. 38-1620. 54] So there is no current plan for that adjustment. [1621. 78-1623. 18] Very simple response. [1623. 26-1625. 46] Please continue to ask. [1627. 82-1629. 02] Good for us. [1634. 34-1635. 34] Hello, I'm the Kashmir Scroll. [1635. 66-1636. 42] There.

[1637. 34-1638. 90] Because of the prohibition of the spread part. [1639. 34-1642. 74] The increase in the deposit spread in the first quarter was explained. [1642. 74-1644. 26] The prohibition spread was flat. [1644. 62-1647. 26] The reason for that is probably why. [1647. 74-1648. 18] The company's idea of banning the spread this year. [1648. 94-1651. 98]

[1651. 98-1654. 02] Keep up with the quarter is maintained. [1654. 50-1655. 30] We are in this section of the prohibition spread. [1655. 30-1657. 66] We are in this section of the prohibition spread. [1659. 38-1660. 98] We in this section of the prohibition spread. [1660. 98-1662. 42] We in this section of the prohibition spread.

[1662. 50-1663. 38] is maintained. [1663. 90-1667. 22] We have seen the dynamics of foreign currency lending. [1668. 14-1671. 30] is probably higher than the high dynamics of foreign currency lending since Taiwan Dollar. [1671. 74-1675. 02] What kind of business is the supply chain turnover. [1675. 34-1676. 42] The supply chain. [1676. 94-1677. 50] Transfers.

[1680. 30-1680. 66] Yes. [1681. 14-1681. 46] Just. [1682. 10-1683. 90] The general manager talked about overseas branches. [1684. 78-1688. 22] There is growth in profits, which is probably the growth of which branches. [1688. 90-1691. 10] What kind of business is this?

[1691. 70-1693. 46] That's another question. [1693. 46-1697. 18] is the other interest in the water-benefit table for the first quarter. [1697. 18-1697. 82] 500 billion. [1698. 30-1699. 98] You can't take a break down with us. [1700. 58-1793. 38] How many bonds are invested in F-Swap. [1703. 78-1706. 58]

[1707. 38-1708. 90] Next to other interests. [1709. 54-1710. 78] A general idea. [1711. 22-1711. 62] or above. [1717. 66-1719. 90] Analysts I made a statement. [1720. 22-1722. 46] In fact, that part of Q4. [1722. 50-1725. 74] NIN here has a positive impact mainly orally.

[1726. 38-1728. 14] The U.S. dollar interest rate hikes for some of us. [1728. 82-1731. 18] The impact of investment positions Swap, etc.. [1731. 46-1734. 06] This is the result. [1734. 58-1736. 26] Let me explain that. [1736. 78-1737. 78] Next we have a view on. [1738. 26-1739. 74] NIN and SWAP.

[1740. 26-1743. 58] One view of Q2 by the end of the year is true. [1743. 98-1744. 66] We are. [1745. 78-1748. 30] At the time we felt the most difficult to estimate once. [1749. 06-1752. 26] Mainly because the overall economy was really chaos. [1752. 62-1754. 90] This morning, the Bede was not a decision of interest rates. [1755. 38-1756. 54] He decided that.

[1775. 30-1759. 94] That Bede has a concept. [1759. 94-1762. 70] He said that the central bank has a dual mission. [1762. 70-1764. 38] is employment and inflation. [1764. 78-1766. 70] The central bank is in control of employment. [1767. 06-1770. 46] Now it is said that the two things they think have. [1770. 46-1772. 54] The risk is that they are difficult to decide.

[1772. 70-1786. 26] So the answer is wait and see. [1776. 26-1776. 98] decided. [1777. 54-1781. 18] plus tariffs plus this Bede policy. [1781. 46-1781. 22] We feel that this NIN in the future is likely to be compared. [1784. 22-1786. 98] Volatility is what we think of it. [1784. 50-1790. 30] That is, if we base some of what we are doing now.

[1790. 98-1793. 22] Business situation Let's make a prediction. [1793. 22-1797. 10] is the current NIN 1.30 we are present. [1797. 34-1800. 06] We estimate that by the end of the year we set our own goals. [1800. 10-1800. 94] 33 [180. 1801.-1802. 60] is an increase of 3 BPs. [1803. 02-1805. 44] If it is SWAP, it is currently 1. 33. [1805-1808. 44] We estimate that by the end of the year 1. 36.

[1801. 98-1810. 76] Let's talk about one of ours. [1811. 80-1814. 76] A hypothesis for the prediction is with our view. [1815. 64-1816. 28] The first one is. [181818. 20-1821. 32] An interest rate environment we've mentioned in the previous few times. [1821. 32-1823. 68] The important concept we refer to is called [1824. 12-1826. 60] An environment where the strength curve normalizes.

[1827. 001-1831. 20] That is, this long-term interest rate he is better than the short-term interest rate. [1831. 20-1834. 68] High We took last year's May 8th. [1834. 72-1837. 08] Today is May 8th. [1837. 641841. 76] This U.S. two-year debt is approximately 40 BPs higher than a 10-year debt. [1842. 12-1843. 28] For last year's today. [1843. 6845. 40] But this year's day.

[1846. 12-1849. 48] The ten-year debt in the United States is almost 50 higher than the two-year debt. [1849. 48-1853. 44] BP This is the normalization of the strength curve. [1853. 44-1856. 96] During the process, I thought he was helping to raise us outside. [1856. 96-1860. 32] This NIN promotion of B is our first argument. [1860. 92-1861. 92] The second argument is that [1862. 56-1861. 48] We have done a lot of work in these two years.

[1866. 48-1868. 80] One thing is that we have mentioned it several times. [1868. 80-1872. 36] That's why we're optimizing this deposit structure as much as we can. [1872. 36-1873. 20] Disperse it. [1873. 76-1875. 60] Then a natural child. [1875. 76-1878. 54] Then we're even going to do something about that deposit bias. [1878. 54-1879. 04] Some.

Our goal is to make our deposit costs have a good control, like our own internal data, our US dollar deposit costs are almost always going down the road. This action we will continue to come out and out the third is that we're always adjusting the amount of money we've got, we've got some special products, we've got some new products, and then we're just happy to see that our foreign currency deposit ratio is also an increase in that it's going to make foreign currency deposits and also contributes to the growth of this 3BP at the end of the year, so Base is a prediction that we'll set ourselves up a 3BP growth, but that's just a possible impact on a tariff policy after July 9. **Part Two: RN Income** That's RN Income I made a few simple explanations Q1 RN Income is 51.9 billion that last year 34. Q1 is the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is also the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is also the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important part of the Q2. It is the most important thing to know Q2. It is very important that we serve a lot of foreign exchange customers and then they put the foreign exchange deposit in our US dollar that he has a profit in the world, and that he has a profit in the past three years, and that this phenomenon is not the amount of time you have spent in the past three years, and that you will lose the cost of the deposit, but if the normalization of the profit in this part of the commercial bank will return to normalize the business. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

[2314. 08-2315. 48] You have to do the service well. [2315. 72-2319. 72] The kinetic energy of your deposit will be stable. [2319. 96-2322. 24] And the better you do, the better the department will be. [2322. 32-2324. 92] And it will continue to grow rapidly. [2325. 56-2329. 16] And it can avoid a lot of the risk of that deposit. [2329. 44-2330. 20] Credit risk.

[2330. 68-2332. 80] This is the main focus of our overseas development. [2333. 32-2335. 72] Such a business is turmoil. [2335. 84-2338. 80] It is less affected by that situation. [2339. 24-2340. 36] So we for overseas. [2340. 64-2342. 68] Of course, there are still a lot of loans overseas. [2343. 16-2343. 96] These loans.

[2343. 96-2347. 44] After all, some of the loans will still be a risky test. [2347. 84-2351. 16] But because of the business we do for overseas loans. [2351 16-2353. 84] We are a relatively conservative attitude. [2353. 88-2356. 92] So we feel good about overseas at the moment. [2357. 28-2358. 16] Although it is volatile. [2358. 16-2361. 28] But it should be clean and optimistic.

[2362. 24-2363. 96] You have to ask. [2364. 40-2365. 20] There is no problem. [2377. 48-2382. 56] The scene is the analyst who initiated the securities Michael. [2383. 28-2385. 72] Please ask Michael. [2387. 04-2389. 88] Thank you for accepting my question. [2389. 88-2391. 28] I have a few questions here.

[2391. 28-2394. 60] The first thing I would like to ask about is this tariff. [2394. 60-2398. 16] We have not done this kind of sensitivity analysis. [2398. 16-2440. 68] Suppose that this tariff is still the same as he now annnounce. [2401. 68-2403. 68] This is the case after an extension. [2403. 68-2405. 24] This is how we continue to land. [2405. 72-2408. 96] This is our income or this credit cost.

[2419. 44-2423. 12] It looks like nine percent is growing in the first quarter. [2423. 12-2423. 92] Fee of Yes [2423. 92-2428. 04] And of course, our revenue is also very good. [2428. 08-2414. 92] Because I don't know what we're doing all year round.

[2432. 28-2434. 80] This target may be like six or seven percent. [2434. 80-2437. 72] This kind of cost growth target is still the same. [2437. 72-2441. 04] This is because our income end will grow better. [2441. 04-2444. 04] We may cost more here. [2444. 04-2446. 96] There will be more than the previous plan. [2447. 16-2449. 88] Then the third I want to clarify.

[2449. 88-2452. 12] Just this NIM problem. [2452. 12-2454. 68] I don't know if I was wrong. [2454. 68-2458. 36] But I was wondering about the NIM of this 1.33. [2458. 84-2461. 44] This guide is based on what kind of. [2461 44-2464. 84] A hypothesis of an interest rate. [2464. 84-2446. 72] And that is, this 1. 33 refers to the time of year.

[2468. 72-2472. 28] 33 is an all-year-round 1. 33 NIM. [2472. 28-2474. 36] Then we can no longer share it. [2474. 36-2477. 44] This is our current foreign currency bond here. [2477. 44-2448. 56] I think the average income ratio is now [2480. 56-2483. 92] So I want to know if I don't know about this foreign currency. [2483. 92-2447. 48] This bond is not YOD.

[2487. 48-2490. 00] There is room for this continued increase. [2490. 00-2490. 48] Thank you. [2492. 28-2495. 28] Accounting longer to respond. [2499. 32-2501. 44] I think it is mainly for this part of the operating expenses. [2501. 44-2504. 24] We grew by about 10. 4% in the first quarter. [2504. 24-2506. 12] We actually had an earlier estimate.

[2506. 12-2509. 32] We actually want to maintain around 7.5% throughout the year. [2509. 32-2512. 44] In principle, we would still like to make 7.5%. [2512. 44-2514. 64] This goal is one direction of efforts. [2514. 64-2518. 04] But it must be said that there are times in the course of business growth.

[2522. 80-2525. 00] includes a salary to employees. [2525. 00-2526. 80] and related rewards, etc. [2527. 00-2528. 32] This is a relatively large number. [2528. 32-2531. 16] Also because revenue growth is faster than we imagine. [2531. 40-2533. 80] Other sales tax will increase a lot. [2534. 24-2536. 44] Also because there are some activities of credit cards.

[2536. 44-2538. 72] We also have a corresponding marketing campaign. [2538. 96-2540. 96] Overall, we feel this kind of growth. [2541. 16-2543. 00] Although it is slightly higher than originally expected. [2543. 00-2545. 64] But basically it is a relatively reasonable range. [2545. 64-2546. 16] Because of our. [2546. 76-2548. 96] Net profit growth rate is much higher than ours.

[2548. 96-2550. 44] Net income growth rate. [2550. 44-2554. 04] Net income growth rate is still higher than that of operating expenses. [2554. 04-2557. 92] So basically maintain a relatively healthy situation. [2558. 00-2559. 44] We think this is good. [2559. 44-2562. 88] But we still want to sell it at 7.5%. [2563. 20-2564. 48]

[2564. 64-2566. 52] But there may be a few more this is possible. [2566. 68-2567. 04] above. [2572. 24-2574. 16] Former Executive Director of the General Office of the Financial Services. [2575. 32-2575. 84] Michael Hello. [2576. 08-2578. 60] That tells you a bit about foreign currency bonds. [2579. 08-2582. 64]

[2582. 64-2585. 44] Almost all of our duration is three to four years. [2585. 80-2589. 08] For the second part, we look at the ratio of movement to floating. [2589. 12-2591. 04] 50% to 50%. [2591. 48-2594. 32] So if you want to estimate the estimate of the future earnings of foreign currency bonds. [2594. 32-2596. 88] Because we have recently made a new position.

[2600. 04-2603. 36] Because recently it should be because of this. [2603. 84-2605. 32] The interest rate market volatility is relatively large. [2605. 32-2608. 28] So credit spread seems to be slightly distorted and waiting for some. [2608. 56-2610. 92] So we can do this if the newly created parts. [2610. 96-2612. 48] Sofra adds about 100. [2612. 76-2615. 88] If the fixed interest rate can be reported above 5%, thank you.

[2620. 68-2622. 92] The analyst I'd like to add to that. [2623. 16-2626. 00] Because we all use NIM in law. [2626. 00-2628. 88] The quarterly is an average of G. [2628. 92-262]

<think> OK, I need to sort the verbatim texts provided by the user into paragraphs. First, I need to read the entire verbatim text to understand the content and structure of each paragraph. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted or rewritten, so the original sentence must be kept strictly while reordering the paragraphs based on logic and context. It is observed that there are several different speakers in the original, possibly different questions and answers in the meeting.

First, deal with the contents of the first part of the three shocks: the repetition of the US-China trade scene, the appreciation of Asian currencies, and the judgment of the future. The speaker here seems to be the same, and it is necessary to combine these sentences consistently into paragraphs, paying attention to the passage of time markings that may correspond to the speech. Next, Alex of UBS asks about the dynamics of foreign currency lending, the distribution ratio of cash dividends, and the merger of insurance companies. These questions need to be segmented by question to ensure that each part of the issue is complete.

The following is the Chairman's response to the two-leverage ratio and the use of capital. This part needs to be independent and may be placed after answering Alex's questions. Finally, the other part of the response to the overseas branch expansion plan for Yushan Bank may need to be integrated into the corresponding paragraph according to the context, such as when responding to North America investment. It is important to note that timestamps may help confirm the order of the speech, but as the user requests are not arranged by time, only by logical segmentation, the focus is on the consistency of the content.

After the completion of the read check, confirm that there are no omissions or errors. </think> The following is a compiled paragraph verbatim transcript: [2756. 92-2759.2 32] This is the first one that affects everyone can be worried about. [2759. 48-2762. 40] But because he has not reached the second is. [2762. 80-27664. 36] There is no negotiation period in mainland China. [2764. 72-2766.2 28] He goes straight into the trial.

[2767. 20-2769. 00] began negotiations after the trial. [2769. 642771. 12] It was after this trial. [2771. 52-775. 24] We had a grace period that they did not have a grace period. [2775. 40-2777. 16] Instead, the order went away. [2777. 64-2801. 68] This was a scenario repeating the Sino-US trade war in March 2018. [2781-12784. 64] [2785. 00-2786. 40] This was the second shock.

[2786. 80-2789. 64] The third shock is the appreciation of Asian currencies. [2790. 12-2793. 04] Taiwan recently gained about 10% of this appreciation. [2793. 24-2793. 80] From that. [2794. 52-2797. 76] It is now about 10 percent. [2798. 16-2801. 68] The media reports focus. [2802. 16-2804. 52] The escalation is too fast, not too much.

[2805. 84-2807. 00] Because of the rise too fast. [2807. 44-2808. 96] The rise is too fast to say. [2809. 36-2811. 40] The amplitude of the appreciation seems to be acceptable to everyone. [2811. 44-2812. 48] If you look at some. [2813. 04-2815. 72] Some industry union leaders speak of theirs. [2816. 04-2818. 52] They do not have a lot of complaints about the current price.

[2819. 08-2821. 32] But the rise is too fast for them to give an opinion. [2822. 04-2824. 96] That means that there is a period of time for our exchange rate. [2825. 20-2826. 80] Let the vendor be very competitive. [2827. 56-2831. 36] The vendor is competitive if there is no money to make money without spending. [2832. 12-2833. 32] So we judge. [2833. 52-2837. 04] Because the three forces are not good to judge together.

[2837. 32-2840. 76] But we think that Taiwan's manufacturer resilience is sufficient. [2841. 04-2843. 40] The risk of this credit. [2843. 88-2844. 84] Should not be too big. [2845. 28-2847. 24] Should be within control. [2847. 60-2849. 12] Although it is complex. [2849. 12-2851. 16] And the current final result is not yet.

[2851. 60-2853. 56] It may be the second half of August. [2854. 04-2855. 84] It will be clearer in the fourth quarter. [2856. 16-2858. 96] But we will not be very worried about the current situation. [2859. 36-2861. 92] This is our opinion for you. [2862. 64-2865. 84] Please ask an online analyst. [2866. 72-2869. 12] Online is the Alex of UBS.

[2869. 92-2871. 52] Alex of UBS. [2871. 88-2873. 16] I would like to ask a question. [2875. 60-2879. 12] Dr Kwan thanked me for the opportunity to ask this question. [2879. 48-2884. 40] The first thing I would like to know about foreign currency lending is [2884. 40-2886. 00] Just mentioned. [2886. 00-2889. 20] On April, I saw that there was an increase in lending power.

[2889. 24-2893. 28] Please ask how to understand in the current uncertainty environment. [2893. 28-2894. 68] This section has a temperature rise. [2894. 68-2896. 28] mainly comes from domestic origin. [2896. 28-2897. 40] Or some loans. [2897. 96-2899. 80] Then it is the case of overseas loans. [2900. 28-2902. 20] Of course, short-term may be all looking forward to it.

[2902. 20-2904. 96] But the second half of the year after these dust settles. [2904. 96-2907. 48] will not expect some driving. [2907. 48-2912. 08] For example, some pulls that include further industrial chain transfers. [2912. 08-2915. 00] and some large companies will go to the U.S. to invest in these needs. [2915. 00-2918. 80] will not also drive the dynamics of some of our foreign currency deposits. [2919. 20-2922. 56] The second question is about the fact that we are talking about in the previous bar.

[2922. 56-2925. 44] will refer to our cash dividend distribution in the future. [2925. 44-2928. 60] This ratio is a consideration of the above mentioned. [2928. 60-2932. 00] In fact, it may also refer to the possibility of our future. [2932. 76-2934. 80] The entire double leverage ratio of the financial control. [2934. 80-2939. 12] There is also room to support such a high-shooting policy. [2939. 12-2940. 80] I would like to ask about this piece.

[2940. 80-2945. 48] We are about 108% of the current DLR. [2945. 48-2947. 64] We have also maintained a considerable period of time. [2947. 68-2952. 24] In the future there will be no one to say what a goal to achieve. [2952. 24-2955. 56] The third question is that [2955. 56-2995. 08] The previous chapter will also refer to it. [2959. 08-2961. 32] The future of this merger.

[2961. 322963. 96] Possible insurance is also a new direction to consider. [2963. 96-2966. 48] This digital insurance was mentioned at the time. [2966. 48-2970. 24] And one of the two combined options of the existing insurance company. [2970. 24-2972. 56] I don't know if there are any new developments recently. [2972. 56-2973. 96] Can be shared with you. [2973. 96-2976. 36] And in both options.

[2976. 48-2980. 52] Which one may be our priority. [2980. 52-2984. 60] If this is the case, then this is the merger of existing insurance companies. [2984. 60-2986. 32] For the target company, this is the consideration. [2986-32989. 24] What are some of our most core considerations. [2989. 24-2993. 72] Includes a potential impact on capital demand. [2993. 72-2996. 32] How to consider thanks.

[3rd paragraph] [3003. 64-3005. 76] Regarding the slowdown in foreign currencies. [3005. 76-3008. 96] We actually see this from now on. [3008. 96-3012. 52] is after the tariff enters the negotiation period. [3012. 52-3016. 08] In fact, the customer has been told that after the tariff comes out. [3016. 08-3017. 16] First, the shipment is suspended. [3017. 16-3020. 36] But in the negotiation period, you are stealing money.

[3020. 36-3022. 40] The status of overtime delivery. [3022. 40-3023. 92] So the entire trade finance. [3023. 92-3027. 00] There are still some motives for some of this business. [3027. 00-3029. 04] There is another part of the overseas business mentioned. [3029. 04-3032. 28] There are some things that are not affected by the overall climate. [3032. 40-3035. 16] Some projects in the country are related to green energy.

[3035. 16-3036. 56] Some related businesses. [3036. 56-3039. 32] That just mentioned that there are some overseas. [3039. 32-3040. 40] opportunities for investment. [3042. 16-3044. 16] We also observed some phenomena. [3044. 16-3047. 72] Because the current is equal to tariffs or uncertain. [3047. 72-3050. 60] So the company may set up factories for the future.

[3050. 60-3052. 80] This may not be the case. [3052. 96-3053. 68] How to deal with the future. [3053. 68-3057. 36] So there are some companies that have moved from the past to Southeast Asia. [3057. 36-3060. 68] He may also look forward to the full tax rate. [3060. 68-3062. 28] How to make a decision. [3062. 28-3064. 88] But we have seen some manufacturers that compare the electronics industry.

[3064. 92-3067. 28] Because they originally had some North America. [3067. 28-3069. 36] or some of the locations in North America. [3069. 36-3072. 92] They were evaluating whether to expand locally. [3072. 92-3076. 16] Its capacity or increase in investment. [3076. 16-3079. 84] This part is probably one of the possible futures. [3080. 32-3082. 36] One of the sources of business momentum is described above.

[3087. 04-3088. 60] Well, I would like to answer that. [3089. 56-3091. 08] The double infection ratio. [3091. 40-3094. 20] Our current double infection ratio is followed. [3094. 64-3097. 60] The net water value of the debt ratio is the top three in the financial control. [3097. 96-3088. 40] The third place we will now use some funds. [3101. 40-3102. 96] Some activations, etc.

[3103. 32-3105. 64] That we will use capital more efficiently. [3105. 64-3108. 56] The line that we set inside is the median of the financial controls. [3108. 56-3110. 16] The median of the financial controls. [3110. 44-3112. 84] That is to say, the financial controls now have 15 assumptions. [3112. 84-3116. 08] We probably take a position about 7 to 8. [3116. 12-3118. 12] This is a point set within our internal controls.

[3118. 64-31]

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim: One analyst asked if there is a business that has nothing to do with a Taiwanese business. Other business besides Taiwanese, it is also important.

There is also a business related to personal green energy or Portrait Finance project financing. This business is actually more controllable in terms of analysis. The source is also rich, so our growth in this area is not affected by manufacturing or trade. This business is mainly in the overseas market, and the market is large, so we have a lot of room for development.

In the fourth decade, Yushan wanted to expand the financial control plan and bank plan. The bank plan was mainly overseas, and if there is an opportunity to buy or sell, we would prefer to expand our financial control plan first, mainly in the securities and insurance system. We hope to expand the size of the securities and insurance system.

If there is a chance, we will be covered in insurance. The plan is still a long-term development plan and a goal to be implemented, but there is currently no target being negotiated. Therefore, the plan is still not clear on a capital plan.
