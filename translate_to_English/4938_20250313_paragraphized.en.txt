I am the host of the conference, Carrie of Citi. Today we are honored to have two co-CEOs, Mr. Zheng Guangzhi, Gary, Mr. Tang Guoyan, Johnson, CFO Ms. Xie Xuhui, Vivian, and the IR team Lily and Hui. In the coming hours, Li Li will explain the financial situation in the fourth quarter.

Carrie, thank you. I will report to you the financial and business information for the year 2024 and the fourth quarter. Please read the second page of Safe Power Notice before entering today's report. Next, please go to the consolidated profit and loss statement for the fourth page. The consolidated profit and loss statement for the year 2024 was $1253 billion, 499 billion, a decrease of 10.5% compared to 2023.

The gross profit portion of the gross profit of 2024 is about 460million yuan, gross profit of 4.1%, compared with the previous year 3.7%, mainly benefiting from the continuous improvement of the production efficiency of the industry, as well as the increase in the production capacity of some central subsidiaries, coupled with the year-over-year growth driven by the operational performance of certain central subsidiaries. In the operating expenses section, about 335million yuan in 2024, a slight increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2023, mainly because of the increase in operating and depreciation costs of some central subsidiaries, and the net operating profit of the whole year was 1.1%.

The gross profit portion of the business was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a gross profit margin of 3.6%, which was lower than the third quarter of last year, mainly due to the different product portfolios, as well as the higher cost of new product development and overseas capacity expansion. In the trading fee section, the fourth quarter of 2024 was $89 billion, while the operating interest rate was $2.9 billion, operating interest rate of 0.9%. In addition, the external earnings of the business in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $30 million, a slight decrease of 11.3%, mainly due to the loss of financial assets in the fourth quarter of 2024.

According to the financial ratio, the current ratio was 133% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, and the interest-bearing ratio was 10%. Please also see the seventh page, the cash flow section, the net cash flow in 2024, the net cash flow in 2024, the net cash flow in 2024, the related capital expenditures are in accordance with the plan. In the financing activity section, the net cash flow is about 2042 billion yuan, the transfer cash flow is about 12.31 billion yuan.

In the first quarter, I asked the chief executive and chief financial officer about the financial outlook. In the first quarter, I did not know if it was possible for the chief executive officer to give an opinion on the growth or decline of each product, and whether it was possible for the second quarter to share some of the visibility, and what the operational objectives would be, thank you, thank you, I am a tutorial, and I would like to report some of the outlooks and projections for the next quarter. In the first quarter, after the peak season of Q4, the Q4 is relatively slow, and the tariffs are still changing.

In terms of consumer electronics and telecommunications products, the same period last year after the peak season of Q4, now into the traditional low season, so the seasonal decline is inevitable, generally Q1 is the lightest season for us.

That's what I hope or should say. The opportunity to keep Q1 or better. Consumer electronics look at it. That is, our game console is actually in the off season. But IOT new product has some customers. New customers will start random.

So we wanted to see what was going on in the fourth quarter [of the season], and we wanted to see what was going on in the fourth quarter [of the season], and we wanted to see what was going on in the fourth quarter [of the season].

So I wanted to be a little bit up and running smoothly. It looked like this year. We continued to expand the share of consumption and business. Then the ODM case was more and more. And then the emerging markets were expanded. That's more and more applications for AIPC for us.

That's a clear trend in the growth of information products. That's in consumer electronics. Whether it's gaming consoles or IOT product categories. There are new customers and new product launches. That should drive revenue growth. That's in communication products.

NetTone is popularized by WiFi 7. There are also 5G, ORAM. There are many parts of our customers in Japan and Southeast Asia. It has been gradually completed. We also hope to drive the growth of the entire performance. That is in speculation.

We continue to be technical. There are also production efforts. Production experience efforts. All that depends on the business situation. Some adjustments to the direction of the customer. Thank you for sharing the factory.

If you want to ask a question, please raise your hand. You can ask a question. I have not asked a question yet. You should not cancel.

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house.

Please start. Can you hear me? Yes. I think there are a few things I would like to ask. These are some superior reviews. I think the company should focus on this server and the EE in the future product line.

That is especially this year or the second year of this AI Server. I can't tell you first what the layout of the company's AI server is. There will be EE companies in the next five years. But this is my first question thank you. God, I'm Gary.

I've come to answer your question. I've looked at the server from that perspective. As I've said in the past few times. We've verified Taiwan's customers for the first time last year. That's what we did last year in Q1. That's what I think.

This is a two-month warranty, so no refunds will be given.

The customer should start with a small order in Q2. Even in the second half of the year. We expect to develop smoothly. Of course, except for customers in Taiwan. I would like to mention it as well.

Our GB200 was in January. It was also delivered to the mid-sized CSP company in the United States. So far, I think both sides should be quite satisfied. It was also tested by our friends. It was almost flat.

But we have a bit of progress. But the chance is a little bit less than before. Believe in such a result. It will attract more customers. The favor of our GB200. The whole server in addition to ourselves in Taoyuan.

We also look forward to serving customers in North America this year. We can provide North America manufacturing. Widely available. Our customers in the United States. This part should be this year.

This is part of the server. Part of the server is not only an AI server. We are on the server of traditional computing. There are also some crawlers. We are even on the supplier of solution provider.

Also won two division deny-in results. This is for our subsequent mass production. Or the client's server. It should also be a great help. Then I'll talk about the part of the car again. The part of the car is in 2024.

We also reached the goal we expected. There are two numbers of growth. Everyone knows the market of automobiles. Under China's competition. Companies in Europe in the United States are also under a lot of pressure.

That was also compared to 2025. In terms of growth, it may be relatively slow. We have existing customers. We strive to win the share of this market. We want to be on the original share. It can improve the strength of the business again.

I think this is something that we still have confidence in. In addition to existing customers, I think we mentioned it in the past. We have the layout of different customers. I think we saw this part too. There are some good results.

The third customer. The fourth customer. The mass production will be counted this year or even the beginning of next year. I think the biggest factor is still coming from. The competition in the market. There are also tariff factors in relation to the entire economy.

We follow the progress of our cooperation with our customers here. I see stability, and gradual growth. There is new development. So it may be along with the factors of the entire market.

Do quick adjustments. Even above the requirements of self-efficacy. To further strengthen. Thank you. That second question. I know the company now for this smartphone business.

It's a relatively conservative start-up. That's what I've been up to. That's what I've been up to. That's what the company has been up to in 2028 or 2029. It's down to 50%. That's why it also takes into account the company.

Just said the two products can be supplemented. This smartphone is falling. That company is not such a target. I hope to say it in a few years, or what year. Will this communication product.

I think the most important thing is to reduce the smartphone to 50%. That's my second question. Assir is good. I still answer your question. It's almost similar to my previous answer. It's really hard for a single customer.

We are told that it is good for the righteous, and that it is good for the wicked, and that it is good for the righteous, and that it is good for the righteous, and that it is good for the wicked.

Naturally, the percentage of smartphone's category. It will decrease. We compare the method of using neutral to see this. We're still good with our customers. That we'll continue to be good.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I check the fragment of the verbatim provided and note that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences.

For example, a few sentences at the beginning are about the importance of the customer, followed by the business image and development ability, and then about percentages and balanced expansion techniques. These may be discussed on the same topic and should be combined into a paragraph. Next, the user's questions and answers section need to be segmented. For example, the questioner's questions and answers should be of their own, but maintain the consistency of the conversation.

During the process, you may encounter logical jumps between some sentences that require segmentation depending on the context. For example, discussion about GB200 and subsequent capital expenditure problems may be subject to different themes and should be handled separately. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that there are no omissions or misplacements. For example, some timestamps may be interval, which may mean that different speakers or topic transitions require correct segmentation. Finally, I will read the passage-based transcription of the entire transition, check whether all sentences are arranged correctly, without omissions or duplicates, and maintain the accuracy and integrity of the original content.

</span> <span class="orgFullName-prefix"></span> <span class="orgFullName-suffix">Auckland</span>

The image of a business must be a positive one. It is just an existing business to a new business. It must also be our ability to develop our greatest ability.

This is not a percentage of the good or bad. The most important thing is to have a balanced expansion. We all face the technology. Then we get better business results. This is the most important.

Thank you for your interest in us. Thank you for your interest in us. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

The first question I want to ask is about it. Server that you have just mentioned. That is, except for GB200. We first talk about GB200. You say there is a medium-sized CFP that has already been shipped to the United States. This belongs to this small number of municipalities.

Then the second season will be larger. Is that enough to think about? Because there are different types of parts mentioned before GB200. The yield of components is not too good to ask. You don't know what you're thinking here. Thank you.

I think that GB200. Because it is water-cooled. Not only this wardrobe needs to be water-cooled. Even the Facility of the Data Center also needs to be matched. We currently have wardrobes on the side of the customer. As I just said the test results.

Both sides should be satisfied. This part is not just a test of our cabinets. The customer is also relative to them. This Data Center builds the equipment. Make a matching witness.

So this is a simple cabinet. After this, as I just said, we should try to fight for our customers to place an order. So we expect it to be more obvious in the second half of the year.

That's what you're saying about some of the parts. I think that's the certification power of the entire engineer. Control over the quality of the manufacturer. I think this is a very detailed one. I don't want to say more. That's what our engineers are doing right now.

We are in our own lab. Of course, there are few who have seen some problems. Of course, we all overcome one by one. It is possible to send the first cabinet to the client side. So we expect it in Q2. Even in the second half of this year.

There is a good news to come. Understand. This is the general service here. Just to mention that there are two kinds of this design. Yes.

Or do you have two or more of them, or do you have one or more of them, or do you have one or more of them, or do you have one or more of them?

Some of the servers on the market are vendors. Probably three or four. Although some CSPs themselves do not have their own solution, this is the direction we are fighting for.

We are very pleased. Our engineers have worked hard. We are very happy. We have worked together, so we have been in Q2 last year. We have also received Q4.

Last year's Q4 ends. At the beginning of this year's Q1. We also got the second DenyWin. That DenyWin does not mean that. The latter business is definitely better. I think we work with DenyWin.

It is also possible to bring along the customer's favor. In our fullfillment operation, we can also quickly meet the customer's needs. There is also a way to achieve the second step.

Thank you. I'm going to bring this new piece again. We've just mentioned this piece of the car. There's a third electric vehicle with a fourth customer. That's it.

Will you join next year? I know we were last year. We also joined a new customer. That third customer is this year. Or next year we will start shipping. As I just said.

In fact, the second customer has already started shipping. It is still stable. The new product is launched. We are also in the list of supply chains. This is the fourth current expectation. It is the end of the year.

There are even a few models in the next year. As I just said, this is the original schedule above. At present, it is worth looking at the whole. The competition with China on this side of the market. And the impact of tariffs.

We need to be cautious. We also ask ourselves. We need to be more flexible to support the needs of our customers. Thank you.

"This is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the righteous," says the Lord.

This year's KF is about $3 billion to $3.5 billion. Basically the original plan is to break the factory, especially in terms of equipment. Because Trump's tariffs are very important for us now, there may also be a new factory set up.

As for the phone you are talking about, this is the phone you are talking about. The guest is a single guest and we don't comment on it. We will work closely with the guest. What do you do? Thank you very much for your help.

Can you hear my voice? Yes, I can. Thank you. I have three questions I'd like to ask here. My first question is a simple one at OPPES. In fact, the last time I said the company.

There is a reference to our next 2025. 75 to 85 million such fees. But the fourth quarter is actually higher. I would like to confirm it again. That is to say, this is more. In the fourth quarter, a one-time fee is incurred.

Or we all year round. Cost an idea above. Need to make some adjustments. This is my first question. If you see that fourth quarter, that is, from 2024 to 2023.

Mergers throughout the group.



This is our hope, this is our hope, this is our hope, thank you, this is our hope, I think because we have not yet shipped a lot, this is not now we can see this number.

Thank you. I would like to ask a question that is just what you said, this is the visibility part, but this is what we see, maybe other four shipping companies, it will give a longer forecast is different, then I also know that Pilatron now customers, U.S.L. customers, it is also in the order part, also to find, like other Dell HP, etc., that is, I am not clear where they traditionally buy these On the show products, what is the opportunity for them to cooperate with us, that is Odine Direct, that is, if they can also find them. **Note:** The provided text appears to be a transcript of conversation, a Q&A session.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcript:. What other On the show suppliers are buying. We have to balance what we have to say. The money we put in this section can be returned to this return. That is to say, for this customer we have to support him after-sales service. That is to say, the part of this after-sales service is the same as other brands.

This server is not just a sales and marketing company. So the entire engineer above, whether it is the resources of the verification process or after-sales service, this is a one-stop service. I want to be as good as the one of Deliver's cabinets for US customers this year.

We really worked with our customers all the time. Even helping our customers to solve some of the problems in the data center. This part I think we have a very good relationship with our customers. We are even the first supplier to send the GV200 to this customer's machine room. So in addition to the technical resources of this engineer, the flexibility of this service is also part of the business.

The U.S. branch that we partner with this year will also expand the number of employees. That is also the expansion of our SERVER business that will also expand the energy of our services for this vehicle customer in North America.

That is to say, if this U.S. plant needs to be built there. The amount of KPAC can be as much as it is. In other words, whether we consider adopting a possible acquisition to speed up the construction of our plant or some transformation process.

I know what you mean but I have set up a factory in the United States. We really didn't set up ourselves in a certain frame. That's basically what we've found in a few places. That's another thing I think you're talking about. We're also constantly working on that company's progress. Thank you very much.

Thank you for accepting my question. I would also like to follow up and just ask about SERVER or AI SERVER. It sounds like we have some pretty good news right now. So it is not possible to give us an estimate of the ratio of SERVER or AI SERVER this year.

This is my first question. I'm sorry. It's really hard to predict at this moment. But since the base period is very low, it's a step in the evolution of shipping. At least it's a double or even three-digit growth.

The part of the SERVER. That's a good idea. Another problem with following up is the part of the EV mentioned. We also know that the two years of competition in China's automakers are likely to be in the market compared to flat. I don't know if we're going to face any pressure on the cost of being required to downgrade the EV.

In fact, every product you produce from mass production every quarter every year every customer is really a requirement. It is difficult to be one of our business and one of our team's daily work. It's not very special and I'm back to Gary. I still think it's a good thing that we're paying attention to one thing that he wants me to drop one piece. I can't lower two pieces and then let the profit one more. This is the best way to do business in always.

So we have been constantly avoiding ourselves. Good and very clear thank you to the management. I have no other questions to thank. I may ask the CEO about the last question here because of the time relationship. That's the part of the capacity transfer. In fact, I just brought a little bit of the CEO to not know if you can ask the CEO.

That is to say, let's take a look at some of our main product lines. If you want to produce in China or somewhere else in Mexico, that's probably what this distribution is all about. At this stage of production outside of China and Mexico, we are not able to fully meet the needs of our customers in the factory.

Answer your questions. I think we didn't do it yesterday or last year. We did it a long time ago. So the planning of capacity is also very clear. That's why the customers will also consider multiple considerations. So the question you're worried about doesn't exist.

The only way to do this is to simply move a percentage or move a product.

That's how the last detail is going to be. That's basically the ratio of moving out to the industry, and it's probably the same for everyone. In different product lines, it's going to sell North America, and most of them will move out. That's right, no matter which product line. For some Asian or European companies, there are different considerations, either it's going to merge the product line, or the product line.

So the whole thing is motivated, customers and product lines have different decisions. Well, understand. Thank you very much for sharing with the CEO. Today, thanks for this question, and it's quite interesting. But we're sorry to say that Q&A is probably the first paragraph here. Before we end our meeting today, is it possible to ask two CEOs to share with the field investment, this closing remark, thank you.

Yes, I am Johnson. Although the tariff policy brings some uncertainty, but the market is expected to gradually improve in this year's scenario, with the continuous breakthrough in the field of AIPC innovation, related software and hardware technology and infrastructure, and so on, the cooperation looks forward to this year's AIPC Server, automotive, differentiated electronics and telecommunications products, still confident that there will be good performance and harvest.
