<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to reorganize the sentences arranged in chronological order into a coherent paragraph, while keeping the original sequence and content of each sentence. This means that it is necessary to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph, and then merge them together, while retaining all the timestamps and content.

It is important to note that there may be a time interval between some sentences, such as [15. 00-18. 00] and [19. 00-23. 00], which may indicate a different speaker or a different subject. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the conversion between paragraphs naturally does not confuse different content when combined. In addition, it is important to ensure that all sentences are included, even if some sentences look likely to be duplicated or inconsistent. For example, the description of Jiashang plant in Zhejiang appears twice, and may require a merger or adjustment of structure, but all information must be retained.

Finally, I will read through the entire converted paragraph verbatim to check for compliance with user requirements, make sure that no sentences are missing, the transition between paragraphs is natural, while maintaining the integrity and accuracy of all original content. If there are uncertain places, further confirmation may be required, but based on the example provided by the user, it should be able to complete the task correctly.

The first general manager of Lee Chi Chi-Chin. The second general manager of Zhao Kunxi. Later, our Zhao Tai helped us to update our current situation. We gave the time directly to the general manager of Zhao Kunxi.

First of all, I would like to thank the host, and also thank the cast members for their invitation to participate in the judiciary committee. Thank you for your investment in advance. Paul and the cast members of the cast members of the Board at 2:30 p.m. today, assess the results of our 2024 annual clearing.

First of all, we will be sponsored by our General Manager, Mr. Zhao Kunxi. Mr. Ku will bring you the basic introduction of the company and the second phase of the membership of the company to bring you the results of the financial settlement of the year 2024. "First of all, I brought to you the current development and overview of the company's finished products and the history process.

After 40 years of cultivation, our main projects cover the following four categories, as well as the emerging developments in recent years. "First of all, the four categories, car-oriented is the biggest part of our current revenue. The first part is our cloud drive, and in recent years, we have developed our largest technology Gate, in AI applications. So the overall hard drive shipping, precision cloud metal, shipping is also a relatively rapid growth. The third part is our medical product-related, benefiting from the global aging population in recent years, and the innovations in related medical devices, shipping on surgical materials and our stylers, both good and good shipping.

This is the development of the company as a whole in recent years." Next, I would like to point out that the development of our overall sports watch is. Our senior technology has four production bases on both sides.

The Taiwan Taoyuan Yangmei Factory was first established and currently ships around NT$22.4 billion in 2024, accounting for around 30% of the total revenue of the group. Our main products in Taiwan factory are sports related to our high-end bicycles, as well as the metal parts of our medical devices, as well as some of our new energy vehicles, as well as our industrial supplies.

First of all, I would like to point out that we are part of South China, our Guangdong factory, which was founded in 1995. At the beginning of our production of our largest hard drive customers, we have a long-term commitment to nearly 30 years, our electronics-related metametal parts are mainly in the development of China's local semiconductor-related related products, as well as our long-term automotive energy fuel delivery.

In addition, in recent years, after the outbreak of the epidemic, we have also set up the Zhejiang Jiashan factory in the part of the Zhejiang parts, which is based on the delivery of new energy vehicles and the main mainland medical wonderful customers. The revenue was $5.217 in 2024, and the number of employees was about 219, and the revenue accounted for about 7% of the total revenue. "After introducing the company's production and past development history, we brought to you the advanced investment in 2024 overall revenue profile and financial settlement results in 2024.

In the first half of 2024, we can see that in the second half of 2024 there is a gradual rewind of Q4 in fact, there is still a part of our business costs in 2024, and we are constantly working hard to reduce the cooling effect and increase productivity. "So in the second half of 2024, the operating costs of the whole year is about 1.5% less than in 2023, and the absolute absolute number is actually more than the decrease. In the second half of 2024, we are also affected by another effect, because we see that some projects with a certain proportion of our cases opened between the end of 2024 and 2025, so in the second half of 2024, we will make some of our self-employed expenses an early recognition of 2024. "Then we can see the external income section, we see that we are relatively high in 2024.

I would like to take advantage of the new quality of the whole metal precision processing company in 2024, and we already have half of the outside income from our exchange rate level in 2024. There are other interest incomes in the following section, and we have been recognized in 2024 in particular in the sale portion of Jiaxing factory in Zhejiang. "The above is probably a description of some out-of-the-box revenues. Overall, I would like to think of the last situation or the constant temperature of our revenue share in 2024, and our gross profit margin is also well adjusted, and we can probably see our growth in the next part.

It is also an important thing, in the case of the external changes are more dramatic, I constantly focus on my own production, in their own cost structure, so we have a good progress in a progress in the business expenses."

The following is a re-arranged paragraph type transcript:. Because the operating costs of the manufacturing industry really don't want to make a big difference. But we're constantly improving ourselves. So we've reduced our operating costs by about 1.5% throughout the year.

First of all, we just mentioned that in the first half of 2024 Q1 Q2, our overall revenue is about 3.5 billion. After gradually pulling back to Q3 Q4, we increased to 4.2 billion. So the overall growth in the second half and the first half is about 20%. I can see that the part of gross profit is actually also seen a good improvement in the footprint. For example, in the case of Q1, our consumption of gross profit is about 46. 96%.

Q3 has started shipping back to normal at 40%. The Q4 part is about 20. 37%. The main thing is to mention some of the self-service fees we mentioned earlier. The business part is also quite significant. From the first half of the year, we are probably about 12% gradually down to less than 9% of Q3 Q4.

Overall, we achieved EPS 396 in Q4. In fact, the annual revenue contribution is also very high for EPS. This overall is what we saw in the micro part of our quarterly revenues and the impact of our industry as well as financial settlement performance. After understanding our overall financial results, I would like to start off by saying that we actually went back to a more normal level in the last year.

First of all, in part, cars are likely to have a lot of competition in the registration of vehicles in 2023, especially in mainland China's factories, or it's very intense competition. In many European and American manufacturers are affected. But in our conventional fuel cars and our new cars, the delivery of the car is really good. We still maintain a colonization of around $4.5 billion in 2023, which is about $60 billion in other revenues. So we can achieve a good growth throughout 2024.

That's why we see some parts of the sport that are part of our BOX's high and low clamping shock absorber shipments and our sports watch pick-up. The growth we have achieved throughout 2024 is about 28%. Electronics greatly benefit from the entire application of AI. These requirements are very practical. That's why the customer's hard drive shipments have increased significantly.

As mentioned earlier in the first half of 2024, we actually experienced a very vigorous inventory adjustment policy for our customers from the end of 2023 to the first half of 2024, which led to our shipment being delayed only after Q3. In fact, in these cases, our Q3 Q4 shipment was not enough to compensate for some of the delays in the first half of the year. So the decline in this part of the year was probably 2%-3%. Other notable is that we actually grew up in the semiconductor and other product categories. It was also the first time to break through 500% of the company's occupation to reach a certain shipment size.

I think the demand for semiconductors may be different in the coming year. But just said that the part of semiconductors may also benefit from the global market demand or continue to increase. And these demand is the same as the demand for the entire industry in the electronic age, which is constantly high. So we believe there will be a relatively variable growth in the size of semiconductor shipments in the next two years. Thanks.

However, in 2024, we have only mentioned that we have maintained our overall shipping amount unchanged or even slightly increased a Percent. However, the proportion of our vehicles has decreased from 63% in 2023 to 59% in 2024. The work we do is that we are constantly moving towards other Niche markets, including our medical and sports electronics as well as semiconductor-related areas. The medical parts are relatively small even in 2024. But I would like to point out that many of our manufacturing investments and manufacturing costs have been relatively stable since 2025.

That part was 65% from 11% in 2023, and that part was 65% in 2024. It was believed that in the next year it looked or was relatively high-grade. The movement part was that in early 2023 we were slightly affected by the large increase in stock in 2024, which also led our overall proportion to 1% to 16%. The gray part was that the semiconductor part just mentioned has actually risen from 3.5% in the past to 5% in 2024.

From the automotive industry, we can clearly see that our proportion in the first half of the year from 67% to 65% to Q3 is also significantly higher because of our medical start to return to normal track shipments. That is why we are showing a constant decrease in the proportion of cars. But it is not a recession that our car conservation rate will continue to have a positive growth situation.

That's the medical part. As just explained, we run a relatively large number of operations in the first half of the year. The stock adjustment of vigorous guests led to the overall shipment of Q1 Q2. It was not as expected.

That's only 3% 8%. That's after Q3. That's why we're back on track. That's why we're in a comprehensive situation. In the second half of the year, we're shipping. In fact, most of them are making up for the first half of the year.

The first to third, the shipment is relatively stable, and there is a growth in the customer because it is in the sports industry.

The bike industry is in Q4. In fact, every company is doing a review. Its overall shipping is a slight decline. Mainly adjust its stock. The rest of it can be seen.

Less than 3%. December 23 is around 3.5%. So far it has been more specific than 5%. Then we can look at this. Changes in Q4 and Q3.

You can see what we're saying in Q4. Compare the specifics. Include the parts we can see in sports. Q4 vs. Q3 is down 16%. Compared to last year and compared to last year. That is, we are actually at the end of 2024.

The adjustment of the customer is relatively obvious. Included we can see. Q4 in 2024 is Q3 in 2024 compared to 2024. It is directly down 26%. That's in the part of the car. We just mentioned.

It is good for governments all over the world. The factory attitude is good for energy saving and emission reduction attitude. In fact, the premise of shipping of new energy vehicles may be seen in advance of investment.

At the same time, its growth power is also higher than in the past 2020 and 2023. It also slows down a lot. We are part of the traditional fuel car.

The order is also gradually tempering. So see Q4 in 2023. Compared to Q4 in 2024. 2024 is an 80% increase. That Q3 in 2024 is the same as Q4 in 2024. It's interesting that it doesn't seem to be affected by some adjustments.

Instead, we added a few more to our order volume. I just said that electronics. We can see the AI needs in the future. It will give us a little bit of growth. It will keep us up to date. We're shipping in Q42024.

In fact, it grew more than the same period last year in 2023. It was nearly 82%. It grew in the fourth quarter of the year. It was a high-end stable state. It was still seen. Q4 in 2024.

In fact, it started to make a strong stock at the end of 2023. Significantly increased by 90%. That in Q4 and Q3 in 2024. It seems that you are also affected by some stock. There is actually a more crucial thing. We are in some special metal categories.

There seems to be some shortage of craft. That caused some shipments of Q4. A slight drop. Well, that's more of an intelligent technology five-point limited company. Advanced for you all. Bringing us a sector of financial settlement in 2024 today.

Thank you very much for joining us as a member, thank you very much.
