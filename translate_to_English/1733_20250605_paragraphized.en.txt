<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to arrange these sentences in logical order to form naturally smooth paragraphs while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. For example, users mention information such as time of establishment, listing situation, number of employees, etc., which may need to be grouped together. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit.

During the processing process, there may be some sentences that repeat or need to adjust the order. For example, the user mentions that "MD7 goods evidence is 20420246" appeared twice, and needs to confirm whether it is repeated or required to merge. In addition, some sentences may have wrong timestamps, such as "[48. 80-52. 18] was founded on December 20, 97," where the timestamp may have an interval between the previous sentence and need to check whether it belongs to the same paragraph.

In addition, the user refers to the "quality system" section, which involves certifications in many countries, and this information should be grouped together by country or type of certification. Product items, such as rapid screening reagents, blood glucose testing, etc., need to be grouped by function or customer feedback to ensure logical clarity. During the conversion process, pay special attention to the correctness of the timestamp and ensure that each sentence's position conforms to its time order. For example, the development of the flu rapid screening reagent should be arranged in chronological order from 2022 to 2024 to avoid confusion.

[77. 76-79. 40] Next is the strictness of the company, there is not much to say. That I think is that we have set up an immune risk department, mainly in the rapid screening reagents, this subject is located in this forum, and then we started in December, 2020, we have obtained the QMS certification for this discussion service, my product is found here, I heard that this end of the month will be obtained, so last week, we heard that we are very jealous. [123. 74-126. 26] Next is 20232024, we actively apply for this MD7, called the certification of the United States, Brazil, and Japan and Australia, we have two years to get this MD7 five-nation certification.

This is the new DEM, and then Brazil and Canada and Japan, the five countries are called MVCET, and then we have a certification, the five countries will pass this. [270. 06-274. 06] Again, this company's product projects, in fact, there are no changes, there are some items, about the so-called items, this professional rapid screening, in addition to this has been started to sell for a while, we have a few items to do, so we will do it, so we will not think about it, whether or not to put it in, or not to give it to customers, the amount of capacity, there is no amount of blood sugar, mainly belongs to the professional use, that is multi-functional, the free brand of water, that is multi-functional solution, that is just said, I said a multi-functional analysis concept, it is that it is the most important, it has this synthe most glyce. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary tract infections. It is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary tract infections. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary tract infections. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary tract infections. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary tract infections. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary urinary tract infections. This is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to urinary urinary urinary tract infections.

[521. 06-523. 06] We all add it. [523. 06-525. 06] Put it on a machine. [525. 06-527. 06] Our own internal. [527. 06-529. 06] We even call it fertility. [529. 06-531. 06] A lot of individual items. [531. 06-533. 06] Can be put into this machine to test.

[533. 06-535. 06] Can be put into this machine to test. [535. 06-537. 06] However, customers may not find it. [537. 06-537. 06] All put in it. [539. 06-541. 06] Because it is not. [541. 06-543. 06] Each area. [543. 06-545. 06] It is.

[545. 06-547. 06] Medical. [547. 06-549. 06] Medical. [549. 06-551. 06] Medical conditions. [551. 06-553. 06] In fact, not every country is exactly the same. [553. 06-555. 06] Some of that may be preferred provinces. [555. 06-557. 06] has blood sugar.

[557. 06-559. 06] Similar to Japanese blood sugars. [559. 06-561. 06] There are not many people with diabetes. [561. 06-563. 06] That's the main one of them. [563. 06-565. 06] Comparison of eating. [565. 06-567. 06] A little bit. [567. 06-569. 06] It sounds like Indonesia.

[569. 06-571. 06] They eat very sweet. [571. 06-573. 06] So they actually have a lot of diabetes. [573. 06-575. 06] There are also obese. [575. 06-577. 06] All these can cause blood sugar. [577. 06-579. 06] There are obese. [579. 06-581. 06] Some.

[581. 06-583. 06] Like the triglycerides. [583. 06-585. 06] There is a little bit of triglycerides here. [585. 06-587. 06] Affects this. [587. 06-589. 06] So this will look at us. [589. 06-591. 06] Our agents in different countries. [591. 06-593. 06] He felt what obesity is that he needs.

[59. 06-595. 06] We are going to make a combination for him. [595. 06-597. 06] is not necessarily one party. [597. 06-599. 06] may be five in one or the other. [599. 06-601. 06] or a few points. [601. 06-603. 06] But my machine may be one. [603. 06-605. 06] But my machine may be one.

[605. 06-607. 06] Do not develop too much. [609. 06-611. 06] This is the third century. [611. 06-613. 06] This is the third century. [613. 06-615. 06] Before that, we have developed the new crown. [615. 06-617. 06] Before that, we developed the new crown. [617. 06-619. 06] This is the new crown.

[619. 06-621. 06] Rapid antigen test. [621. 06-623. 06] The proof of application at that time is. [623. 06-625. 06] That is the one. [625. 06-627. 06] Provisional evidence for use. [627. 06-629. 06] So it is like this year. [629. 06-631. 06] Why do people rebound.

[631. 06-633. 06] means that someone had been diagnosed for three days. [633. 06-635. 06] Because there was a lot of clinical experiments there. [635. 06-637. 06] There was another one. [637. 06-639. 06] Your virus was already taken. [639. 06-641. 06] And those virus tests were performed. [641. 06-643. 06] These.

[643. 06-645. 06] So we think it's impossible to do three days. [645. 06-647. 06] So there is clinical experiment. [647. 06-649. 06] You need to reach a quantity for free. [649. 06-651. 06] You may get a result. [651. 06-653. 06] This is now. [653. 06-655. 06] Because we are developing ABC as well.

[655. 06-657. 06] That is now. [657. 06-659. 06] This will continue. [659. 06-661. 06] This will continue. [661. 06-663. 06] We may ABC be next. [663. 06-665. 06] After the flu, we will add three more. [665. 06-667. 06]

[667. 06-669. 06] We will add three more three more. [669. 06-671. 06] becomes a more complete product. [671. 06-673. 06] ABC. [673. 06-675. 06] We also have a pneumonia infection certificate. [675. 06-677. 06] We have another pneumonia infection certificate. [677. 06-679. 06] We have a pneumonia infection certificate. [677. 06-679. 06]

[679. 06-681. 06] is what the customer wants to do. [681. 06-681. 06] also made it to the test. [683. 06-685. 06] But now it is the situation of his sales. [685. 06-687. 06] But now it is the situation of his sales. [687. 06-689. 06] began to ship small quantities. [689. 06-691. 06] That amount is not very big.

[691. 06-693. 06] This is the following. [693. 06-695. 06] It may be a vector pattern. [695. 06-697. 06] Infectious diseases. [697. 06-699. 06] There are also animal images. [699. 06-701. 06] It is called a pig. [701. 06-703. 06]

[703. 06-705. 06] Anorexia of sheep. [705. 06-707. 06] This is a drug test. [707. 06-709. 06] This is the same kind of use. [709. 06-711. 06] This technology platform. [711. 06-713. 06] This technology platform is three times faster. [713. 06-715. 06] This is the only antigen antibody inside.

[715. 06-717. 06] That is. [717. 06-719. 06] We all compare care. [719. 06-721. 06] is the CGM of our household. [721. 06-723.1. 06] The comparison is to confirm how our household CGM is doing. [723. 06-725. 06] We are present. [725. 06-727. 06] May come in time.

[727. 06-729. 06] End of year. [729. 06-731. 06] End of year can not be more clear. [731. 06-733. 06] Then it can not be delivered. [733. 06-735. 06] These are determined. [735. 06-737. 06] Of course, next year. [737. 06-739. 06] The time of year.

[739. 06-741. 06] and then the time of the certification. [741. 06-743. 06] can be started to export. [745. 06-747. 06] This. [747. 06-749. 06] The personalized project. [749. 06-751. 06] This is the time for our company to present.

[753. 06-755. 06] We are technology. [755. 06-757. 06] Our existing technology platform is. [757. 06-759. 06] This phone science optical. [759. 06-761. 06] Follow the flow immunoassay. [761. 06-763. 06] There will be more later, of course. [763. 06-765. 06] There are other technologies.

[765. 06-767. 06] We may not have written it. [767. 06-769. 06] Because our product development has not yet come out completely. [769. 06-771. 06] is not clear. [771. 06-773. 06] This is our technology platform. [773. 06-775. 06] It will produce some new products. [775. 06-777. 06] Of course we are.

[777. 06-779. 06] Continue to optimize more products come out. [779. 06-781. 06] Then look at the customer's needs. [781. 06-783. 06] Then, the law goes on. [783. 06-785. 06] Just like yesterday three days ago. [787. 06-789. 06] We are doing Ivdr.

[789. 06-791. 06] Certification of Taiwan. [791. 06-791. 06] That is called ivdr. [793. 06-795. 06] Complete for the previous ivdd. [795. 06-797. 06] The content of their regulations. [797. 06-799. 06] The difference is quite large. [799. 06-801. 06] So here we go.

[801. 06-803. 06] Adapts to the requirements of these regulations. [803. 06-805. 06] Then. [805. 06-807. 06] All products are now available. [807. 06-809. 06] Basically all products are. [809. 06-801. 06] Medical materials or pharmaceuticals. [811. 06-801. 06] All medicines to be studied must also be clinical.

[813. 06-815. 06] Previously ivdd. [815. 06-817. 06] Can't wait to do it. [817. 06-819. 06] is now basically required. [819. 06-821. 06] This is the same as this 4G 5G 8G. [823. 06-825. 06] This wide interface.

[825. 06-827. 06] Now. [827. 06-829. 06] In the European Union. [829. 06-831. 06] They call it. [831. 06-833. 06] It also defines some new regulations. [833. 06-835. 06] So we say it now. [835. 06-387. 06]

[837. 06-839. 06] Internet products. [839. 06-841. 06] or interface. [841. 06-843. 06] This is in line with the requirements of this regulation. [843. 06-845. 06] This requirement. [845. 06-847. 06] will become more and more stringent. [847. 06-849. 06]

[849. 06-851. 06] This is also the case. [851. 06-853. 06] Then we will make our own app. [853. 06-855. 06] Last week they also came out. [855. 06-857. 06] Our own app is not bad. [857. 06-851. 06] That's OK. [85. 06-851. 06] It's convenient for my customers to use it.

[861. 06-863. 06] Because we wanted to say it. [863. 06-865. 06] can be combined with someone else's app. [865. 06-867. 06] After that, our customer responded to us. [867. 06-869. 06] He did not want to follow. [869. 06-871. 06] Other apps. [871. 06-873. 06] Some app too fancy.

[873. 06-875. 06] It is too complicated for them. [875. 06-877. 06] They use the above operation. [877. 06-879. 06] There is no need for so much. [879. 06-881. 06] So we now. [881. 06-883. 06] When we developed our own app. [883. 06-887. 06] It was a bit simpler.

[885. 06-887. 06] When the machine is finished, he can automatically transfer it to us. [887. 06-889. 06] along with our own app. [889. 06-891. 06] He himself will enter it. [891. 06-893. 06] This is the case. [893. 06-897. 06] Now it's a follow-up promotion. [895. 06-897. 06] We have iOS and Android versions.

[897. 06-899. 06] So here to see. [899. 06-901. 06] Later on it will be available. [901. 06-903. 06] Promotion. [903. 06-905. 06] Situation. [905. 06-907. 06] That. [907. 06-909. 06] That is the case.

[909. 06-911. 06] This just said. [911. 06-913. 06] CGM of ICU. [913. 06-915. 06] This is the real thing. [915. 06-917. 06] It is waiting now. [917. 06-919. 06] This is the witness. [919. 06-921. 06] Then it is back.

This article has just been published. This is the market. This is the proportion of the department. This year's EQ. The United States looks relatively high.

The European Union is relatively small. Asia is also very small. That Asia is. I want half of it, sales from the mainland. There is a decrease.

The land of the living, the land of the dead, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the land of the living, the sea of the living, the sea of the living, the sea of the living.

We have a wealth of knowledge, and we have a wealth of knowledge, and we have a wealth of knowledge.

It is the word of God, and it is the word of God; it is the word of God; it is the word of God; it is the word of God; it is the word of God; it is the word of God; it is the word of God.

It's a bit stale, but instead of a single one of our customers in Austria, it's supposed to be a little bit smaller here, so it's a EQ all year.

Financial figures. Actually, I found. The EQ can be calculated.

Maori. It's a bit low. It's 29 more than I thought. It's actually a machine and an accessory. That's the proportion, and I'm going to remove it myself.

And We made it an example to their own time, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him, and a lesson to those who followed him.

It's a little higher this year, so it's actually 2Q. I feel that our financial numbers should all be wrong.

So this year's goal can't be seen. repeat it in the second half of the year. repeat it in the second half of the year. that's the ratio of products. that may be with you.

This is the orange of this 6%. 20266% of the 2025 EQ. Only 2% of why.

We made it to the end of the day, and before that, we made it to the end of the day, and then we made it to the end of the day.

We want to help the whole packaging. The packaging of goods shipped. In fact, it is also good for us. Because the cost of packaging products is relatively high, but some of them are so high.

This amount, this amount, this amount, from 6% to 2%.

In turn, I'm going to take this snowcap. It's going to increase. It's not snowcap. It's going to test the legs. It's a bit down. It's not the same.

We are now in the United States, and there are some evidences to prove that we are not a snowcap here, and then there are evidences.

This is the second half of the year. Well, that's it. That's the 11th Corporate Governance Evaluation.

This year, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, it was 78 points last year, it was 88. 4 points this year, it was 88.

Aggregation is. 21 to 35%. But if you say a layer list. That is a layer list. That will reach 50 dollars. Companies that reach 50 dollars will come to the table.

We are also higher. This proportion is between 2% and 10%. We work very hard to make EVSG. And there is that. Information transparency there. Expression.

"This is our message to you, and this is our message to you, so that you may come to know the truth, and the truth will not be forgotten."

It's only a small change in the financial numbers. That's what I also recognize. We have some. Product customer development. There's a little bit of slowness there. Tariffs.

I feel like what I see right now is. 10% we went to the US before. That's it. The US subsidiary said. Tariff is 10%. The highest is now 10%.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for two days are at hand: for two days are at hand.

Because our tariffs were previously 0. That's the highest right now. It's now 10%. It's impossible to go back to 32%. It's not possible.

And if we are saved, we are saved; if we are saved, we are saved; if we are saved, we are saved; if we are lost, we are lost; if we are lost, we are lost; if we are lost, we are lost; if we are lost, we are lost; if we are lost, we are lost; if we are lost, we are lost.

And when the time comes, they will be with us, and we will be with them, and they will be with us, and we will be with them.

You will be able to say, "We are going to do this for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or, "We are going to do it for you," or "We are going to do it for you."
