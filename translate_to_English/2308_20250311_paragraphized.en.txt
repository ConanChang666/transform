Thank you very much. We are very pleased to welcome you all today. We are very pleased to announce that Yuanta Securities Investment Forum was held in the first quarter of this year.

And the Lord said unto us, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for we are filled with the knowledge of the truth, and of the truth, and of the truth, and of the truth, and of the truth, and of the truth, and of the truth, and of the lie, and of the truth, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie, and of the lie.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

The four-year period of the Qur'an is about two weeks, and the month of the Qur'an is about two weeks, and the month of the Qur'an is about two weeks, and the month of the Qur'an is about two months.

We were talking about the legal meeting at the time. It might include a little bit of it. There are some rhetoric in the talk. Of course, we'll ask the question. That's something I'll have to say first. Our company doesn't make a ruling.

So we do this, of course, we will talk about our expectations, but there is no way to give a predictive number, that's the part of the earnings, that's the whole year it has audition. That's the part of the year.

There are no audits for the fourth quarter. But I'm going to talk about the fourth quarter. We have a lot of earnings. Revenue is 11.4 billion. That's about two percent better than the third quarter.

Season-to-season two percent. Year-to-year is 14 percent. Last year was the whole year. First quarter was the time. Revenue was still two percent lower than the first quarter of the previous year.

The second half of the year begins to go down. It is actually twenty-four years. It seems to be. The second quarter is relatively difficult compared to the first quarter. The second quarter is a little better than the first quarter. We are growing about two percent.

Then in the third quarter, we increased to about five percent. The fourth quarter was relatively better than that. Because the fourth quarter of the previous year was really already. The climate was not good. So we had 14 percent growth each year. We also announced our revenue in December this year.

Then January is 15 percent. There are 40 percent in February. That is the year. So February is about 20 percent. That's a lot better than last year. That's what we look forward to this year.

This is because the base period is relatively low. So last year there were a lot of businesses that were more difficult. In addition to this data center. Many of them were in recession. Now, the base period is slightly lower.

There are a lot of power or fans, like these applications, consumer or industrial, etc. The base period is relatively low, so it may become a positive growth.

That's less dragging. That's a lot of data center growth. This year's contribution is much more. Because it takes up more and more of our share. It's like the power supply of this server. The previous year, two or three years, accounted for about 15 percent of our revenue.

By 24 years, we've grown 15 percent. Now we've grown to 19 percent. We've grown 26 percent. There's no surprise this year. Maybe we're going to have 20 percent of our revenue. That's why AI is the fastest growing piece.

Two or three years ago, we accounted for about two percent of our revenue. Last year, about four or five percent. This year, of course, if it goes well, there is much more. If this is doubled, then doubled.

It contributes more and more every year. So this is the main reason for our acceleration. Another big reason is that we are here.

Last year's revenue was actually very little. Our system was about 10 million. Then the components were about 1.4 billion. But this year we expect this piece to be very significant. Just January. There are already about 2.6 billion.

It's almost the same as last year's revenue. It's only January. And of course, after that, I hope to continue to have a lot of revenue. So this part of the year will have a lot of revenue. So this is it.

We expect revenue to grow faster. It's a matter of course or not. The market needs the situation. Then another is the supply chain. It's a fullfill. Because it's like this AI server so far.

There is no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person, no such thing as a righteous person.

There are a lot of things that are hard to do, but the Lord is quick, but the order is actually quite slippery in the market.

We do not have any tags for The Truth Is In Our Eyes [Stereo] lyrics.

Gross profit margin last year was slightly higher. The first quarter was only 29.5. The second quarter was recorded high. Up to 34.9.

Special factors are what we used to be here before. This is what we later called during the pandemic. Supply chain disruption. The amount of our company's stock is a lot more. It also breaks a lot of this stock.

This is the preparatory for the loss of overlays. This preparatory is purely accounting for the preservation of some. This is possible, and the loss of provision is not actually so much loss.

There are few of them who have lost their lives for years, and those who have lost their lives for years, and those who have lost their lives for years, and those who have lost their lives for years, and those who have lost their lives for years, and those who have not lost their lives for years.

On the contrary.

This is the reason why the product is particularly high in gross margin compared to the previous year. This is why the product is not so obvious, although the amount of inventory is already in the third quarter at the end of the third quarter compared to the third quarter at the end of the fourth quarter, about 800 million to the end of the fourth quarter more than this 300 million, so in fact, we should say that the fourth quarter is more prepared for the loss of inventory, because inventory usually starts from the 90, some of the losses are prepared. This year, if we can speed up the product, but comparison may not be as obvious last year, the number of our inventory will be much longer than this is the reason for the structure, but in general terms of the company's various changes our demand. This is the most important thing in the world. We are going to review a lot of these companies before the end of each period, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, we will review a lot of these companies, especially the companies that we have acquired, because when you buy it, you must buy it. If you buy it, you don't need to buy it. If you buy it, you need to buy it, you don't need to buy it, but if you buy it, you want to buy it, you need to buy it, you need to buy it, you need to buy it, you don't need to buy it, you don't need to buy it, you need to buy it, you don't need to buy it. 4% fall in gross profit This previous time, OP margin fell from 14.6 The 3rd quarter is record high less than the 4th quarter down 10 whole operating profit or 3 percent higher than the previous year, but compared to the 3rd quarter fell more than the 3rd quarter, that again we will give you these figures in this sector every time we give you a reference. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them from a verbatim format to a paragraph verbatim verb. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed with any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim content provided. It looks like this is a discussion about market conditions, business performance, financial data, and tax impact. Timestamps and corresponding sentences are arranged in chronological order, but they need to organize them into a consistent paragraph while maintaining the original order and content of each sentence.

First of all, I will check it every step of the way to make sure there are no omissions or errors. For example, it is noted that there is a timestamp between some timestamps, such as [895. 74-899. 06] and [955. 74-958. 04], but the original text of the user does not have these parts, so it may be necessary to confirm the correctness. However, based on the data provided by the user, I need to strictly follow the given content.

It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic, but are separated by timestamps. For example, on the part of the tax rate, from the "tax rate is probably 20" to "it's hard to master but it's possible to increase" that needs to be organized together in order to ensure logical fluctuation. At the same time, to deal with some repeated or linked words, such as "Then", "So", etc., these may need to be adjusted in the conversion, but the user asks not to delete anything, so it must be retained.

In addition, be aware of the correct representation of numbers and percentages, such as "7 percent" should be kept as it is, rather than converted to "7%." The user may want to keep oral expressions such as "10 percent" instead of "10% or more." During the processing process, it is also necessary to check whether there are typographical or format problems, such as whether the decimal point in the timestamp is correct, whether the sentence is complete. For example, [955. 74-958. 04] "The basis of the power supply but if" needs to be verified correctly, but according to the original text provided by the user must be retained as it.

After completing the initial conversion, I read through the entire paragraph verbatim to check if it meets all the requirements of the user: not deleting anything, keeping the original order, correct segmentation, and a natural smooth reading experience. If there is any uncertainty, it may be necessary to re-arrange the original data to ensure the accuracy of the conversion.

The automation fourth quarter machine has been relatively low, so there are 7 percent of the growth. Inside. That industrial automation about 10 percent. The building automation or recession is that the seven percent of the year, the two machines are not really high. So there may be a slight acceleration.

In the fourth quarter, 21 percent of the infrastructure is growing. In fact, it has begun to see a little bit. The contribution of this cold system is about 1 billion. Nearby, about 1 billion around the 300 billion billion is not really much for growth.

Some of them are due to contributions. They have grown about 60 billion. Some of them are related to the data center. We are talking about the so-called data center infrastructure.

The main reason for this increase in profits is because of that. This infrastructure in the data center. margin is not good. This may continue to grow the biggest part of this year in infrastructure.

The main reason for this is the data center infrastructure. Included. There will be a lot of cold then. The power portion will also grow a lot. The power base, but if so, the majority of it will come from power electronics.

This is. Weld and Butter. This is the two. Automation. Follow this mobility. This is the EV.

Probably. There is no obvious contribution. Business in the fourth quarter has a little bit less choice. The Thai Baht is still in value in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is still in value. In fact, it is slightly deteriorating, but we have operations in Thailand.

The greater the portion, the greater the portion, the more likely it will be to lose; the more it will be to lose; the less it will be to lose; and the more it will be to lose.

But this is more than just what I said. Let's go to review these five lines of advice.

Loss. Then. the whole profession. In the fourth quarter is negative 816. Compared to the previous quarter, the contribution made by the 21st quarter is much less. So this.

Pre-tax net worth and post-tax net worth have some declines compared to the previous quarter and the previous year. Income tax here I want to explain a little bit. It looks valid. The tax rate is increased a lot to more than 25% between abruptly.

The former probably out of 20. That's not really the case. The main reason is that the loss is mostly not comparable to tax. So if you put back the $20 billion loss, it's actually not that high tax rate.

No. The tax rate is about 20 out of 20. This year is more likely to rise slightly because of this. This is the OECD requirement. This is called the minimum tax burden.

There are two places that influence us the most: Thailand and Singapore. Singapore is a holding company. Thailand is a large operation. But there are very few taxes paid there. The practice of OECD is that if we do not pay taxes in both places.

We are going to be taxed elsewhere. For example, last year we were in fact. The Dutch subsidiary has been kneaded because they hold Thailand. About 15%. The Dutch government has been kneaded by the minimum tax of 15%.

This is possible. That is more or less. The tax laws in Singapore in Thailand need to be amended. That is what the government is doing. We also can't control the fact that so far it is not. So we can only say that the tax rate may increase, but we can only say that it is possible.

How high or when. Yes. It is difficult to master, but it is possible to increase. Taxes are slightly increased. Non-controlling interests are very small in the fourth quarter. The main reason is Thailand.

It has a lot of such a one-time disadvantage. So, the freight is almost zero. That's tucked away. Very little because I want to take it off in Thailand.

More than 36 of this. The net profit after tax gives non-controlling rights. So the net profit after tax is three to later. Less than 72 million. For the quarter of that year to the quarter.

We are looking forward to some rebounds in the first quarter. The main thing is that the one-time factors do not exist. So this is the fourth quarter of last year EPS.

As I said, all of them are 5% higher, and this year is going to be a lot faster.

The gross profit portion has grown by 17% last year. The average gross profit margin has already reached 32.4%. That's the case with the portfolio this year. The chance to achieve this level is quite high. But hopefully that's the case. It's hard to predict.

That's exactly what I said. We had 17 percent last year. It was actually more than our budget. We wanted to increase by about 15 percent year-on-year. There was no surprise this year. It should be a bit slower.

However, it may be limited. The double digits should not go too far. Because, after all, there are still some inductions. And the company's rapid growth. Some things are related to growth.

For example, in the cost of sales. Some, such as shipping costs, etc. It will appear. It will increase in comparison. Therefore, there will be some increase in business costs. But it should not be a rapid increase in revenue.

So the operating cost was 21.1% last year. This should be the highest in our history. This year should be slightly lower. That is to say, we should have a little improvement leverage.

We hope that OP margin. Able to be 11.3% higher than last year. In fact, last year's figure was quite high. Remember that this is not the highest in our history.

Our revenue growth last year was 16%. If revenue growth is accelerated this year, OP margin can add a little more. This can increase a little faster. again is the number of different departments.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided copying fragments, sorting them into paragraph-provided copying. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the provided copying texts in a manner that pay attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentence.

For example, on the part of Power Electronics, the continuous sentences are combined into a paragraph to maintain logical coherence. For repeated questions, such as the monetization of mobility and automation, it may be necessary to merge the duplicate sentences, but the user requests not to delete anything, so it must be preserved all the time and may be appropriately separated in the paragraphs. During the processing, I need to pay special attention to the correctness of technical terms and terminology, such as "Power Electronics", "EV charger", "Solar inverter", etc., to ensure that the spelling and formatting are correct.

In addition, the user mentioned more financial data and business department discussion, need to ensure that this information is clearly presented in the paragraphs to avoid confusion. For example, for the Infrastructure department growth rate, the data center solution growth, etc., needs to be segmented to make it easy for readers to understand. When dealing with duplicate content, such as "but our profitability has no obvious pick-up" appears many times, I need to confirm whether it is a standalone sentence or a duplicate of the same sentence.

After I finished the initial draft, I read through it to make sure that everything is properly integrated, no omissions or errors, and to ensure that it is fully compliant with the user's requirements. </think> [paragraphed transcription]: This profit is almost 80% more, and about 80% less, from Power Electronics. This year, it should probably be a little less, a little bit less, but most of it comes from Power Electronics, which is no problem. What is the problem with mobility and automation profit contribution? What is the problem with mobility and automation profit contribution?

What is the difference between mobility and automation? In fact, this year, although revenue may be a little bit better than automation, last year was a decline of three branches, mainly because of building automation. We also had a bit of growth in industrial automation last year, but so far, the market situation is a little bit better, out of the bottom, but our profitability is not significantly improved, so it is difficult to expect a significant increase in profitability.

The data center solution has a lot of growth, but our network has a lot of decline last year, about 25%, this year should be a lot, so this part of the year will be much higher, because the data center and cooling will contribute a lot of growth, and the profit will continue to grow. In fact, last year, the profit will increase by 28%, and this year there will be a significant increase.

In fact, 6 billion is still a normal range in the company's history, 34 billion outside revenue is still normal, but we are now relatively large, so it may be a little bit more, if it is normal to say, maybe 45 billion, but the previous year is abnormal, because in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognize a paper rich, the joint debt suddenly recognized so many, breaking rules. Well, so the whole year, last year's net income compared to the previous year has a slight increase, the tax rate is slightly higher, not the company's interest is a little bit less, mainly because of Thailand, the fourth quarter is a little bit less.

In the first quarter of this year, we felt that we would be better than normal season, after which we expect a normal season growth, seasonal growth, two quarters will be more than the first quarter, then the third quarter more than the second quarter, and then the fourth quarter is too early, now it is a bit too early. Well, that's probably what I'm going to do soon. Thanks to the QA management, the part is now replaced by me, and you want to do what you want to do, we're going to ask by our host, the first question, management said in a recent legal meeting, in the data center, in addition to the power architecture level, reg level, which is the so called medium voltage here there are some products, can share a lot of the layout and products on the side of Delta in the medium voltage?

In fact, it is quite common, but this type of door has no hor Olia resistance. But meille is also saying that light is alair, we can also do this, we don't need to always do it, we also want to do it, we also want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it, we want to do it. It's like a plastic shell, of course not worth the metal shell compared to the value, but when you put these things into the PowerShelf, you have more control components, etc. These money can be earned, and then you put into the Rack inside the Rack is actually a PowerShelf, so the original PowerShelf money is actually a powerShelf, that is very expensive, and that is also the source of our revenue. If you help some other equipment, what VVU or Compositor, we have a lot of revenue. In fact, it's very competitive that we want to win the whole power industry.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text provided by the user and convert it from the verbatim format to the paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, all the original sentences must be retained. This means that I need to be arranged strictly in the order of the sentences provided, while also making the content easier to read.

First of all, I read through the whole transcription to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly discusses the development trend of AI computing capabilities, future needs, and related technical demonstrations. Next, I need to identify logical relationships between sentences and determine how to segment them. For example, when the speaker mentions "unless everyone suddenly falls down on computing power," it may be a turning point that requires individual segmentation. Similarly, when discussing different technical stages (such as language models to video processing), it may require segmentation processing.

For example, the user mentioned that "this opportunity is low" and "the opportunity is low" may belong to the same sentence, need to confirm whether the timestamp is continuous. According to the timestamp, the two sentences are continuous, so it should be combined as a sentence. In addition, pay attention to whether the format of the timestamp is correct, whether there is a misplacement situation, such as "2013. 58-2014. 86" is actually 20 watts" is correct, it may be necessary to confirm whether the timestamp corresponds correctly, but the user does not point out the problem, so temporarily as to deal with it.

For example, when a speaker turns from discussion to a technical presentation (such as a GTC event), this may require segmentation. Similarly, when referring to the "Next Week GTC" and the virtual exhibition area, this information should remain on the same topic and should remain together. In addition, the end part of the thanks and subsequent content need to be segmented correctly to ensure that each paragraph has a clear theme. Finally, I will read the paragraph-based transcription after the entire transition, check whether all the original sentences are properly preserved, without omissions or errors. At the same time, make sure that the transition between paragraphs are natural, consistent with the smoothness of spoken expressions. If there are uncertain places, such as if the timestamps correspond to the correct, but the user does not provide further information, only follow the content provided.

In summary, my step is to read through the understanding of content, identify logical relationships, process special characters, check integrity, and ensure compliance with all requirements of the user. Start the conversion now. </think> The following is a paragraph-based transcription of the finishing process: [2013. 58-2014. 86] It is actually 20 MW. [2015. 38-2018. 20] So it is always improving. [2018. 20-2018. 96] This is a trend that [2019. 48-2021. 02] is almost certain.

[2021. 02-2021. 78] Unless [2022. 30-2025. 36] Unless this general requirement for computing power [2025. 62-2026. 90] suddenly declines. [2027. 16-2027. 66] But [2027. 92-2028. 78] This we think is a very low chance [202828. 74-2030. 78] [2030. 78-203. 86] Even if these so-called Deep-Seek [2033. 86-2035. 90] These more innovative methods [2036. 16-2037. 44] The model [2039. 50-2041. 54] [2086. 58] It is actually in the early stages of its development [2044. 86-2048. 46] It is now seeing the so-2050. 24 that the demand for this computing power [20. It is difficult for us to determine [2097. 70-2099. 24], but technically speaking [2099. 50-2100. 78], is always going forward [2110 02-2110. 80], that is [2110. 86-2103. 40], it is quite fixed trend [2104. 86-2103. 40] Details I find difficult to say [2108. 46-2111. 78], as I said this week [21121212. 30-2113], we will have [2113. 58-2115], if there is a chance to go to the best [2115.88-2117], we will have Virtual[2118. 74-2119], a fair zone [2119. 76].
