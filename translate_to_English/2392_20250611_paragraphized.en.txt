NV flatbed connector cable. Signal converter power products. Also, it is a connector for electric vehicles. There is also a soft board battery module related. This is the part of our components.

I think some. The first is the AI intelligent video system product. With AR device. AR model. Like several major manufacturers of AR device products.

Also in the gaming and gaming console joystick headphones. Manufacturer-based gaming console related products. This is also the main product of our company.

Another Pencil, like a smart pen, has a headset, a wearable device, and a wristband.

There are also electric vehicles. Electric bicycles. 5G-related products. There are also POSE systems. We now have several POSE-related products. Energy parts.

As you can see, one of them is. Just what I said. Fuen Energy's Taipower. Li An in the second half of the year. We are working hard to make progress on this marine project. We hope it will be completed and completed this year.

We also have one of the next batch. Preparation of a 32. A Yode wind power. Activated carbon exploration and design. The next batch of Li An wind power. The third one is Fuhui power.

Fuhui Power has been listed in January this year. The green power market is continuously laid out. At the same time, it cooperates with the power supply regulations. Actively expand the engineering business of the energy storage market. You can see our energy storage. There is a large factory in Suao, Yilan.

We continue to strive for the channels. Government's large-scale educational projects. Deeply rooted in the campus.

Also master AI. Drive the whole. Change the tide. Drive our revenue growth. The last is the AI compute center that we set up. That's the AI compute center.

We now want to add value to this cloud. Software services. We start with something. It's all about electricity. It uses our power to charge us. We want it this year.

We want to engage our customers with software again. We want to attract some long-term customers. Because most of our clients are short-term now. They are short-term. We start this year with AI computing. We want to add some service platforms for software.

And We made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember, and We made it easy for you, and We made it easy for you, and We made it easy for you, and We made it easy for you, and We made it easy for you.

Let's take a look at some. It looks like legal entities also have some questions. Friends, I have seen some problems. It is also helpful for us to collect. The first is to say.

I want to look forward to the business of computing. I think we just set up this computing center last year. We are currently production and operation and AI. We are computing power in combination. I think many industries have performed well this year. Including AI based on a lot of equipment.

Perform analysis of this data. Predict the good or bad of this device. Can be repaired in advance. Using the computational power of AI can also optimize our production process. Scheduled production lines. Of course.

There is also an AI detection, which can also be used in all aspects of AI. It can be automatically detected.

This is also achieved. Smart factory. Even do part of the unmanned factory. I think these can all use the computing power and AI. Improve our production efficiency. And reduce costs.

Our company is part of this company. It also takes the ability of this AI. It operates in various productions. Economic optimization is carried out. We invest in the center of computing power. Of course, we also hope to have a good help in this regard.

I saw it last week, too. We have an AI company that created a robotic development company. Use the NVIDIA platform to work with it. Smart security and advanced manufacturing plants can be done in the future. I think this will also bring some growth to our group.

Another AI computing power. We will also use this computing power now. To strengthen some of our internal R&D processes. To improve some of our use of AI to speed up efficiency.

I just mentioned it. I just saw that we are about to be at peace from 1 to May. I can say that we are in the second half of the year. The traditional peak season of our electronics industry. I think this year will be next year. We will continue to grow our revenue this year.

The manufacturing part just said. That's the part of the component of the channel. It's probably a little more growth. The system's part will be flat. The energy part will be more growth.

I want to revitalize the main customers are all with some. The cooperation of the major brands, including the consumer electronics and parts part. They are all in cooperation with the major European and American manufacturers.

Currently, we are outside of the AI computing center. We are on AI server. There are some related products. Includes power supply. High Power Supply Project also has a battery module. Now he is finished with the battery backup power module.

We have already tested 3kW with our customers. 5. 5kW and 8kW are now in development. Last time we saw AEC AOC this. We are now sending samples. In this part of AI computing power. We also set up a new AI robot company.

He is also working with the Amedia platform. I hope to build some. Smart Advanced Manufacturing Factory. Last time, this data center was simple.

Here's what I'm going to say. FIFA, I'm in the middle of it, and we're going to do something about it. By the way, I think we're going to start talking about the US this year too. We're going to invest in Texas, mainly about his ecology, because now our customers also want Trump to come up with this tariff, so we're also hoping that some of our customers are going to be able to produce in the US, so we're planning some investments in Texas, so we're going to have some in Texas.

Hello. Thank you for investing advancedly today. I would like to thank you for your continued support and understanding of the societal economy industry.
