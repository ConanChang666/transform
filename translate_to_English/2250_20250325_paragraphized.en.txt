Agriculture offer email Fridays pictures live at Boss Plaza 저 利宏ably. The folk house factory we set up last year. This folk house factory is mainly aimed at the technology of auto parts.

And career development. Some reporters. Last year, we opened a new factory. It was mentioned, because Minku was a major town of Japanese cars. In the past, it actually moved from our insider factory to Minku.

The so-called car is something beyond five hours of driving. Because our customers love it. We want to be close to development. So this factory is a small factory for us. But it is a very important base for me and my customers to develop. This is last year.

He is the Lord of the harvest, and He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest; He is the Lord of the harvest.

Of course, we are mainly Japanese cars. If your factory in China is just a factory, it will be more competitive. So we have been developing for years. In fact, it is only a production base.

It's also developed with business development. That's a look at our numbers. I'm going to explain it again. But here I'm going to talk about it. Let's take the Dongguan factory as an example.

Car. Japanese car. The former one was MISA and Honda combined. It means that the automobile industry has wind hulls. Don't talk about China's business has fallen. That's our factory in Dongguan.

Last year 2024. My performance was about 5% decline compared to 2023. But I have a profit. Our factory in Dongguan has created a new high in recent years.

That's the main reason for that. Of course, my internal improvement. That's why I have to say. I often ask myself. Japanese cars are getting worse. That's what we all know.

This is the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, the way we live, and the way we live.

At least you won't die. If you try again, maybe you'll get ahead of us. It's probably the situation in Dongguan that we're in.

Vietnam factory he is the main customer. There is an electric appliance for a single customer. It is our main agent. Thailand factory is with Soplas. I just mentioned it before. In our consolidated report for three years.

The first two years were really for us. The shopper was one of us. But the second half of last year to the beginning of last year. That was the whole adjustment to turn into one. Then the voice of some customers in Thailand.

Malaysia's factory has been transitioning over the past few years. He does not focus on cars. It is the main part of the OA and other affairs machinery. This is basically us.

The business now has ỉ Junior. Rabbit whistle. Why. cnc order. I am pi겠다.

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, it's just a coincidence, it's just a coincidence.

It's called Camsara, no. In the interview, hit the house, and then all of this, a lot of it.

Well. OK. Our. Robotics concept is probably what you would imagine if it were TOTO. This toilet you probably wouldn't think it was like that.

But you won't expect this to break for 10 years. You'll wait another 15 years for the best of your life. That's what we do in Japan. The combination of TOTO is ours. And there are some electric tools that have been in the past, and now it's going to be zero this year. That's what we did in Malaysia.

Assisted in the first transformation into a doctorate-led electric tool in Malaysia. Attacked to a doctorate in Malaysia. That changed with geopolitical changes in the whole world. Dr. wanted us to attack before. But it was more and more costly, so we started last year.

The power tool business is stripped off. That is why the percentage will be lower later. And the business is a cut-off for lower integration research in the past two years. But the development of the entire group is an important strategic position. But after the year has been adjusted, the proportion will decrease.

That's what we're going to do again in the future. That's when the car weighs the biggest in our part. That's the engine of the car. That's where my customer lives. He does Wirering. But we didn't do Wirering and Connect.

We do not have any tags for This Is Us lyrics. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it. you are the one who made it, you are the one who made it, you are the one who made it, you are the one who made it, you are the one who made it.

It has the electrode sheet that is plugged into the electrode in this place. It's because it's a fixed sheet. So when you plug in it, it's similar to the precision requirement. It's because you're more aware of the chip. It's plugged on that electrode sheet.

This is a long time. Your yield or quality is unstable.

**Please note:** Because.

It's effective, so it's also safe. That's the biggest proportion of our customers. It's mainly in Vietnam factory. The second is called EPP electric parking brake system. Previously, it was manual braking, and now it's pressed.

This is why we are one of a kind, long-wearing calipers in this brake. It is a disc brake, which is a disc brake. Then put two calipers next to it. If you need to park, use this calipers and attach the brake skin to that disc. This is what we do, a gearbox driven by the motor. This is because it is a high temperature of 250 degrees and a high temperature and then a car environment, it is a dirty environment.

So the requirement for the material is not the same, and then the whole package of this product, it must be much more control. So it looks easy, but its quality requirement is very high with safety requirements. That is, in the last five years, it is really important for us to enter and exit the business. From high-end cars to corolla, this small and medium-sized cars.

It is a system of stock market brakes. Stock market brakes in Japan, can be used in small cars, may see many kinds of Japanese, mother in the country of the small, similar to a bakery. Its brake system is not in the style of disc, it is in the stock market, it has the same EPP mechanism.

People can buy it, for example, in the market, there are economic systems, different tools. It can be immunized, and then these are, in a slender ookie, can direct. Then it is possible, when the market is for a long time, let the progress of the market, I see me보, will be with our business for a long time, full of anges.

This is what SOPLUS is doing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, As a safety part thing, in the past, this experience, although there is no such thing as mainland car, we have been doing business in the factory, in the past without you in the future, the trend we see is with me just example, when his quality requirements are getting higher and higher, these safety systems things, such as the background of things, such as the company in China still have a certain competitiveness, when the development speed is slower, but these two are we, there is that this is a soulplus this one looks big but in fact is very small is the car motor, this is, and then there is a we call the rubber ring it is very thin, small, that the customer is there is a company called Nivco, that is the electric motor in each electric vehicle, there are about 15 to 20, such a circle of parts, the product we give, the product is called Nivco Nivco Nivco Garage Japan a factory, there is a lot of plastic parts, there is a lot of the world, electric parts, electric parts, electric parts are the same we are the same we are the same we will be the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as this is a half as the part, but this is the same as the same as this is the same as the same as this is the same as the engine, but this is a lot, but this is a lot of the same as this is not a lot, we do it is a lot of the electric motor, but this is a lot of the same thing is a lot of the same as the electric motor, but this is a lot of a lot, we will not a lot, we do it is a lot, but this is a lot of the same as a lot of a lot of a lot, but this is not a lot, we do is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the electric motor, because we will not a lot, because we will not a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot, but this is a lot, this is a lot of a lot of the electric motor, but this is a new, this is a lot of the electric motor, this is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the product is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a new

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any one of the original texts, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original text. Next, I check the texts provided by the user in a step-by-step manner, paying attention to each timestamp and corresponding sentences.

In the process of processing, I need to pay special attention to the continuity of the timestamp, to ensure that each sentence is correct and does not disrupt the original sequence of time due to paragraph adjustments. At the same time, to identify possible duplicated or connected sentences, such as the user mentioned "that" beginning sentence, usually means that the previous sentence may need to be merged with the previous sentence. In addition, the user mentioned customers such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and products such as Actuator, GnoH technology, are critical information, and need to ensure that these terms are presented correctly in paragraphs without losing any details. At the same time, note that the accuracy of the numbers and percentages, such as "50-60%" data must be retained as they are.

For example, if the interval between the two timestamps is too large or too small, it may belong to the same topic, which can be combined into a paragraph; if the interval is too long, it may be necessary to segment. Finally, after finishing the preliminary finishing, I will read the whole paragraph typed text, confirm that there is no missing any sentences, all the contents are retained according to the user's requirements, and the paragraph is reasonable and logically clear. At the same time, check whether there is a format error, if the timestamp corresponds correctly, whether the punctuation marks are appropriate. In summary, the process requires a detailed sentence analysis to ensure that fragmented sentences are integrated into a structured, easy-to-read paragraph-paged text without changing the original intent.

The following is the compiled paragraph verbatim script: These terms are probably what we're talking about in the car, and that's what we're doing inside a rector. That's what the customer is doing in the electric mount. That's just an impression to me today in this briefing, that's because we're not seeing the development of our industry, and now we're doing business two years ago, that's the next two years.

This chart has always been so emphasized in the past, because we look at the business model in three years later, do you have this road map in the development of this product? This is a form of business. So this is about cars, and that is what we call intelligent life. It just explained this switch cover in front of the toilet, that is the head, that is, the agency is actually very simple, but this usage. White home appliance customers usually expect his product life is 10 years, and will not be bad.

That's why we are one of the three main apartment owners. So these are the main customers of optoelectricity, Sony, Panasonic, and Lexil. The displacement toilets are all Japanese brands. This is about 18% of our revenue. So from the customer's point of view, there is an electric love, there is a trading company called Yoko, but my customer is Yoko, so that's stealing, these plus other micro-languages are basically car-based.

The last user of the car is about 50-60% of Toyota, the second one is Honda, and the third one is Nissan. In terms of the development of the Japanese car, the first generation of Toyota that you have generally seen is unnecessary to talk about, then Honda is probably a very good thing for us, the former Nissan and Honda merge, and once heard that Honda is more powerful, and Nissan is less vulnerable. So this order is a good thing for us, to die. I want to say that it is just a bear, you just have to live faster than the last one. So in terms of the customer structure, I think we are doing Japanese cars, but it is healthy, then Toyota is also known that we have some new business progress.

This is not too much increase is that some products we let go of, some products we make in the car, like we did a lot of business machine parts, those business slowly let off, so in the last few years we actually have an adjustment in the internal, that is also because of the adjustment plus internal improvement, so in addition to the epidemic year, my gross profit rate is constantly increasing. This is the year of performance, so this year we EPS is 6. 0, in fact, we have the best year since we merged in the year of listing. This is the first, if we look at the season, it was the whole year of Q1 to Q4, before 2023 to Q4, this is the net profit before tax, then last year is a relatively stable year, the overall EPS is just said the best year.

That's right, it's been a few years since then, and the intelligence of NMedia has improved since then.

So the need is getting bigger and more realistic. The main thing is, of course, that's all the prototyping robots are talking about right now. That's what it was before, of course, the arm of this industrial robot. That's how hard it is to be a collaborative robot Sony.

That's what it is. Honda is also a service for the elderly. So the first thing I want to express is in the field of robotics. Of course we can't afford to lose money.

It's not as big as I could possibly say, but yes, it's a company, it's a country.

The CEO of Omron, a company based in the United States, is the CEO of Omron, a robot business unit in Japan.

Omron's collaborative robot who did it for him. Taiwan's Daming. Daming's business inside. Details we know there's a big bottom for Omron to do. So the first reason we cast him is to be Japanese he knows. The world's second market.

He is the one who sees it, and he is the one who sees it.

The creation of the product is in Taiwan. The team produces the dastardly. Here it is used for his strength. This robot is because of the action.

So usually the action is slow. But his action can be very fast and naturally close to the person. Less than one degree he will have a different degree of slowdown. So there are some inside. The control module is our group of franchises.

He did it in a visual way. The controls of security were attached to the outside. The one he met. So this collaborative robot wanted to work with people. Develop so his master. It is Taiwan.

He was born of a team. He was born of a team. He was part of the control software for the team to develop. We are. Lis Lis Lis developed. We cast him of course. Mainly he is one.

Not native to Taiwan but has the basis of Taiwan. The first two goals we have for him are: I can use this investment.

This is because he is the one who has made it, and he is the one who has made it, and he is the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, and the one who has made it, the one who has made it, and the one who has made it, the one who has made it, and the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who has made it, the one who is the one who has made it.

This. Robot. First of all, a group of supply chains in this field of collaborative robots. After all, we have only a few parts. The so-called gears.

Many of these are not plastic. This is the first. The second most important purpose. In the development of the world. Japan is still an important thing.

He is the Lord of the Worlds, and He is the Lord of the Worlds, and He is the Lord of the Worlds, and He is the Lord of the Worlds, and He is the Lord of the Worlds.

That's it. That's it. That's us. The group's long-term layout, everyone look at it as an electric vehicle in the past. You can develop your ability for 10 years.

It used to be on the robot. That is. The robot used to be on the robot before. But before it was because it wasn't intelligent. Edge computer wasn't that strong.

The cloud movement of AI is not so strong. So without learning so its application is not present. You build it. The institution is mature. New things are these more detailed wages. That's in the process.

It's like a Japanese car. It's good now. But with the start of China's car rolls. These original factories are under pressure. That China doesn't need to talk about the current robots. Including service robots.

We have been living in this world for years, and we have been living in this world, and we have been living in this world, and we have been living in this world, but we have not been living in this world, and we have been living in this world.

I think. So we want our value to be. We have the design and the module. But that's not what I earn. But I have a market that I can do.

Business development, business development, can rely on the group, these are related, go.

So I went back to the previous picture. The first explanation is that we are, of course, in the field of the actuator at our core. Let's continue.

Serving my customers to do. However, there are some new things in the face of the Japanese market. We want some. Investing. Mastering some key elements.

Let's serve more people. That's less. After a Japanese company came to Taiwan, we wanted it to create value. Instead of just saying that I would do a small amount of joints. That's the industry of today's robots. As I just explained the area of the idea to increase the level of intelligence.

But he said. Daming robots 3000. 3000 more than the year before based on the last data. So, in the field of robots we want to express, we will not be absent. But in fact, we can do this at this stage of time.

I want to have a chance to come back and serve them in this market. That's my report. I'm pretty much done. Thank you, President.

Next to the CQ&A exchange time. Please guests. I really don't ask. Anime and spirit. Please acknowledge the questions on the scene. The staff on the site will be on the outside group.

Please explain your company number when you speak. Reason. Then ask again. The intelligent process will explain to you. Which one of you is the first to start with. Haha.

And he said to them, "Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for I am a man of unclean lips, or of unclean lips, or of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips, or of unclean lips, or of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips, or of a woman of unclean lips, or of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips, or of a woman of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips, or of a woman of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips, or of a man of unclean lips.

I'm from Taipei, Taiwan. I'm a financial general company. That's why I want to ask the company that doesn't have any interest. It's going to be the same. We're going to make cash this year.

That's right. 3. 5 3 5 5 5 Shares 0. 5 is right. So, if you say it should be mine, I'll make more than 6 pieces this year. If I'm going to pay interest rates in my past, it should be about 70% to 80%.

It is not because I have not paid dividends before. Oh yeah, no reason why. I think we should have seen this issue before.

The future is good. That's the stock dividend. Of course. Or want to keep a portion of the money in the first two reasons. Taipei is one of us.

KY Holding Company. KY Company. KY Company. KY Company. Usually the hardest thing, because we are not in Taipei itself. No revenue.

We don't have enough space. If we want to split the dividend, give it to the shareholders. If I give the shareholders, I'll go from abroad.

When we get back, because our structure is Japan. So below, for example, I want to take the Vietnamese currency back I was pulled two pieces. Because above is Japan. Japan above KY. So you say.

Vietnam spends money. Currency. Japan then returns from Japan to KY. The two products were pulled. So, Taiwan's headquarters had to be used before Paige Wang.

Borrow money with the bank and then go back in time. We now have that charter with that CPU. The cash price at the headquarters is more than we want to be first. Keep some money. This first. Money is left.

Second, this year, this year, 2020, until 2026. If you ask me, the business challenge is to ask you psychological questions.

Japan is almost 100% of our business. Almost. A large percentage of it is based on it. That said, I don't worry about my TOTO revenue. It's about 16% of the area-related.

That I don't think will affect the part of the car. 60 percent. That I think will change the market this year. It's not small, so money or a little bit of safety. That's the answer to your question but.

I would like to say that the interest rate is not too bad for shareholders. A small part of that gives birth to that. Shares. I call it. I ask for it because it looks like last year.

You will be able to do the same thing in the same year as you do. You will start to produce. Robotic numbers. Go with the parts of the gear.

Now I want to think about whether this progress is based on schedule. I do. I also make you. It is said that there are competitors in the back, and you are not here. With the Japanese manufacturers with us to develop the second problem. Of course, investing in growth is good for us.

However, standing on the stakeholder position because of the long-term pursuit. The return on equity is good for us. Yes, the plan for the next five years is that I'm probably the whole blueprint. How long?

I'm really curious if I'm a long-term investor. I've invested in your company for the five-year roadmap that will probably make a profit. I'm probably curious about what the president looks like.

Last year I was me, me, me, me.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim fragments of the user and organize them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided.

It is important to note that some sentences may be repeated or paused, such as "uh", "that uh", etc., which need to be preserved and can not be omitted. First, I will check the contents corresponding to each timestamp in a sentence to ensure that there is no omission. For example, the first timestamp is [2369. 46-2374. 84], the content is "these modules of the new car do business well so that you will have just licensed the owner's zero shares." Next, [2374. 84-2376], "Let's start talking with the customer", then [2376. 88-2377], "that uh", etc. I need to sort these sentences in chronological order and appropriate segmentation to make the paragraphs more readable. During processing, I may encounter some connection problems between sentences such as "that 'that 'that 'that 'transaction'transactions' need to maintain consistency in order to maintain oral coherness.

At the same time, pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences, such as the structure of the question and the answer, to ensure that the paragraph is smooth. In addition, it is very important that the user mentions "do not delete any sentence", so even if some sentences look incomplete or duplicate, such as "uh", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that", "that"," and "that" at timestamps [2376. 88-2377. 92] and [23381.76-2383. 30] need to remain in paragraphs, to reflect the pause and doubt of the speaker.

For example, the "don't push like this" of the timestamp [2508. 38-2509. 40] and the subsequent sentences need to be aligned correctly to maintain the continuity of the conversation. Finally, after finishing the preliminary finishing, I will read the entire paragraph verbose, check if there are missing sentences or formatting errors, and make sure that all the contents are in line with the user's requirements. At the same time, confirm that there are no modifications or deletions to the original text to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the original. In summary, the process requires careful handling of each timestamp corresponding to the content, keeping the order and integrity of the original, while making the whole verbose text easier to read and understand through reasonable segmentation.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for you, but I'm not sure if it's the right place for you. I think it's the right place for you. I think it's the right place for you. I think I'm going to do this because after three years I don't want to say it three years later, and I'm going to do the right thing for you, but my clients have the right thing for me.

I think the real question is what we can do behind this, besides the existing customers, I think this is more important, I just tried to say eh, because I am a Japanese company my main customer, what else is the industry I can do with my services, I think from the perspective of the future is to invest in this part of the investment with us. In fact, the whole investment is four units of investment, and the ability to innovate and invest with our ability to invest in Asia differentiated these four four times, and then drip into drip into the director. What I want to say is that in the future, we may use this investment to get out of my present now, because I want to use the basic model of the next time I want to talk more about it in the next time I want to talk about it. This is what I'm talking about here is that there are two stacks of stock market will be this one, which is the EPB, which belongs to the stock market brake system, the end of the fourth quarter of this year saw us with this new module next year, we talk about the rise of coordination mechanism, it should be the fourth quarter, then it should be large, it should be next year is next year, there are a lot of this kind of cooling module, this part is this is called PCU, this is electric installation business, this year will see this situation, but this year will not see this year's increase the amount of speed, this year will be too fast, there will be some other small things I won't say if this is mainly this. I't ask the investment company, the question is that we's in s s s s s scis here compared landlords to see a Chinese robot company, want a Chinese robot company to have the opportunity to enter the Chinese robot company.

I just said in advance that the lower cost of not meeting the Chinese robot is another company in our group in Suzhou factory there is a service robot that taught me to even the company that is so we will certainly have some contact with the Chinese robot business or I am going to say now that I want to let you know the scope of my contact in this market to answer a basic question or I said that it is almost the same thing that you are reading in the newspaper I just said service robot, so there are some contact so I went to Shanghai last week.

I am very surprised to see some of the software companies next to my customers in China, but this surprise is that most people know that China's speed is very fast, no I don't want to tell you, that we are in another factory in Shenzhen, we don't make a big robot, but this year because we are not low-end plastic gear, this is what I do is precision plastic gear, this time is more than done less, more precision, less do is more than the car is not for use in the car, this year we are in the sweeping robot called stone, stone should be China is also the world's largest sweeping robot, then what I do in the future, the question I just said is why you do you have to do the world's largest, almost I know the number of the world, why now I have the opportunity to do his gear, that's to do it, that's the factory in China's 12 years, and then you have to do a lot of the local manager is there is a local, so much more. This time I went to the chat to see my customer he took me to see his company to visit me Xuhui a startup park is a smart robot-related company, then he took me to see a startup founder CEO 27 years old, he was the head of the original robot development department, he previously called the genius teenager to join Huawei, that in Huawei did a few years, so to see Google Huawei's robot development he came out of the business, because there were some problems with the IP, we finally solved the problem that he was born 27 years old, we looked at a city and then lay in the office to sleep it, because the robot is not a hardware problem robot is the software AI problem, I think this is not to talk about China's operation is not a reality that they are very fast, and you say that this is a lot of years to develop him, and I just said that my customer's hot white base in Xuhui district there is a bunch of startup center. But it doesn't matter to me, I hope that we have been able to use his resources to do business in Japan if he has an international competitiveness. I would like to say that we are too slow to do our own robots. Thank you for attending the meeting today. <h1> I am very surprised to see some of the software companies next to my customers in China, but this surprise is that most of us know the speed of China, and I do not want to tell you that we are in another factory in Shenzhen, we do not make a big robot, but this year because our factory in Shenzhen is not low to be done, I am doing precision plastic gear, this time is more than done less than done do more precision, more precision, low to do is compared to the car is not for use in the car, this year we are in the sweeping robot called stone, stone should be China is also the world's largest sweeping robot in the world, then I will continue to say that I just talk about you, it is not what you want to do in the future, it is why you are doing the world is the largest, in the sweeping robot in the world, why now I have the opportunity to do it is to do his gear, that we have to do it, that we have a lot of the same. The intelligent level is not higher and higher than the intelligent level or when the GPU is the lower the cost of the algorithm it will explode in China I saw this chat with my customer he took me to see his company to visit me Xu Hui a startup park is all robot-related company, then he took me to see a startup CEO 27 years old, he Huawei original robot development department director, he used to call genius young people to join Huawei, that was in Huawei for a few years, so you go to play Google Huawei robot development he came out of business, last year because there was an IP problem, finally solve him, we look at the software, because the robot is not a hardware problem robot, AI problem, I think this is not a Chinese camp, I am not really very fast, and you say that we are 27 years old, how many years can develop him, and I just talk to customers call his development base Xuhui a new robot company, he told us to talk about this terrible, I have to talk about it. But my first words don't matter to me, I hope that we can have international competitiveness, I can use his resources to do Japanese business, I want to express that we make our own robots too slow. `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
