Then his broadband should be wide enough. So in VC implementation, the actual penetration rate in addition to Notebook and VGA are gradually starting to increase.

That said, if our company is an air-cooled heat dissipation module, in fact, we are a simple component is a maker of the main part. But when the market is in the water, we will become a system solution provider. So the solution provider, in addition to this is, of course, the original is the heat of our chip, we still know how to do it, right. We are codeplay, the former is HeSync, the water is now put codeplay, the liquid is put codeplay.

That's why it invests in the water-cooled part, the water-cooled part, we really research, at least 12 years, in this one. Well, that's our company's product history, we start from notebook, then back at VGA, Smartphone, Server, Automotive, and Liquid Cooling. So you can see that the company in the last 25 years, 25 years, every three to five companies will enter a new market, and that's probably the problem of density, because the larger the air-cooled module, the longer the longer you get the Rec chip, right. So it invests in the water-cooled part, the water-cooled part, we really study, at least 12 years, can say, at least 12 years, in this one piece.

The reason is that some of our customers in Europe and America, especially CSP customers, do Server, in 2020, we want CSP customers, and he wants us to diversify the production of a risk, so he wants us to be where we are now is China, and then add a new production line. We chose Thailand, so we are now in Thailand because we are not going to go there because of tariffs, we actually started to layout there as early as 2020. Well, next is that we should see a little bit in this diagram, the actual diagram is very basic to talk about why water is needed, and how to use fluid energy.

That's the response, you're the EU2EU3 is every standard rack, about 48U, then the EU is about 4.4 cm, well, there's a concept. So for example, today we say today is 4U high this HeatSync, actually it is a can be placed in 4U, you want a drawer concept, 4U drawer, the 2U HeatSync is placed in 2U high such. So you can see that the higher the actual wattage, the higher the actual U, even later you can go down to the bottom to see, now there are 6U to 8U is the solution of the chip. But you can imagine this 6U to 8U.

It's really a lot of space. Well, what is that? Of course, it's the core of the whole system. Copper is the material of copper. It's the structure of a U-shaped structure that you put in the water cooling system, and the water will flow past and take away the heat from the chip.

Well, that's why, if you're driving Liquid Cooling, you can increase your unit size. That's why you can increase your computing power per square feet. The density of your computing power is going to increase. Well, so we know it's because we know that the density of water is higher than the air. So water is actually more efficient to take away the heat of this chip.

That's 1. 2 1. 1 or less. Even some performance is better than 1. 6. 6 or less. Well, so the difference in the middle you want is that if I put the water cooled, I can increase my Cold Structure.

That's why we can save about 30%-40% of our electricity. That's why it's all about money. That's electricity, because now everyone has a lack of electricity. But that's a very important point, if you have a Data Center, your electricity is so big. But when you're going to upgrade to another system, you might still be the only one doing these things.

You only have to change the way you heat up, you have to increase your power. Well, that's the part. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution.

This is Rake Manipal. This is just as welcome to our BOOST. This is our BOOST on the first floor. It is J0106 that he can see. It is a lot of things you can see there. It is Rake Manipal.

Then we put it on the back of the cabinet. Then it is Rake. Then it is Building Manipal. This is the building Manipal. This is even Coplay. We have to show the difference.

It's for AMD NVIDIA Intel. It's a different solution. That's why we even do ASIC Coplay. It's the ASIC Solution. But the ASIC part doesn't show. That's because it's customized.

This is the first of the two verses of the Qur'an, and the second of them is the Qur'an, and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

That's what we're talking about right now. Direct to Chip. It's the form of RAC. It's because Emergent Cooling. It's actually a topic.

That's with technology. It's less mature. It takes more time. It's research and development. At least Direct to Chip.

This is the beginning of the journey, and the end of the journey is the beginning of the journey, and the end of the journey is the end of the journey, and the end of the journey is the end of the journey.

This is the first of the two verses of the Qur'an and the second of the two verses of the Qur'an, and the second of the two verses of the Qur'an and the second of the Qur'an.

All of them are good; all of them are good; all of them are good; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad.

This is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the righteous, saith the Lord.

This piping requires connection to. That's Isolated Cooling System. That's what I need. That's what I need.

That's why Liquid to Liquid. That's with Liquid to Air. That's the difference between it and Liquid to Air.

If you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place.

That's what I have here. It's our company. It's a video. It's what we share with you. That's why we put it on YouTube. If you play Aura StickLiquid Cooling, you can play Aura StickLiquid.

You will see this movie, that is, you can search the website of the company, or the company's official website, that is, you can also have the movie, that is, the movie is telling us.

That's how Echo Play puts GB300. That's GB200. That's B200. That's either it's memory or not. That's not just CPU. That's GPU cold water.

Even memory is fanless. This is the concept of fanless. This is the whole fanless. This is where you can see it.

This is the part of the GB200. That is, it is CPU plus memory. That is, it is the solution of B200. That is the solution of the eight chips.

That's what you can see downstairs. That's why we also have a Center Detector. This is the device to prevent leakage.

We have a device to prevent water leakage. We want to talk about an NVL72 that is how Liquid to Air works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in water-cooled systems. We want to talk about an NVL72 that is how Liquid to Air works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in water-cooled systems. This is the concept of Building Manifold.

We can transport liquids from one pipe to another through this device. Then, this is In-Raw CDU. This device can transport liquids from one pipe to another. We don't need to use Fan. However, because Liquid to Liquid, it can get higher watts.

This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in the water-cooled system. Well, we will come back to the presentation. We want to talk about how the water-cooled system works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in the water-cooled system.

Ok, so let's go to the Q&A section. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and wait a little while for the microphone to answer our questions. Then, of course, we will wait a bit for the microphone to answer our questions. Then, of course, we will wait for the microphone to answer our questions.

That microphone gives you this kind of online investment friends can also hear your problem clearly. So now Q&A links, do you have an investment advanced want to ask questions? Or media friends want to ask questions? So if you don't have any related questions, I'd like to ask you first, because I just mentioned that this year's part of the cold will be accounted for about 45% of the revenue.

So it's good to mention that this year's part of Yi cold will pull to about 40%. So if we mention that the part of the factory in Thailand is really much, most of us are doing water cold things. So it's not saying that this year's part of the factory in Thailand is probably very small, and it's probably from last year's about how much it is from last year's about how much it will pull from last year's about how much it might be this year's about how much it's going to pull from last year's about how much it's been this year to more than this year's maybe more than this year's? If you want to know how to do it, you can also do it. If you really want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you really want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it. If you want to do it, we can do it.

Today, we are going to have our second session. We are going to talk about some of our performance prospects and Q&A sessions. Just like the previous one, a company will have 30 minutes, the first 20 minutes we will ask H&A for a presentation, and then some financial and future development trends. The next 10 minutes are the Q&A section, so you can raise your hand, and of course, remember to use the microphone, because we have to be online, and there are also online audience friends to hear about the problem.

Well, first of all, I would like to introduce a simple history of our company since its inception. The company was founded in 2004, when the turnover was about 30 million dollars, the staff was about 70 people, and the main product at that time was the digital photo frame.

Then he decided to make a transition with the management of the company. Then repositioning our company's products and strategies to make this relatively high-speed transmission chip. Of course, this period also has a lot of effort. That was when our turnover reached 1.6 billion dollars in 2012, and we went on the stock market in Taiwan at the end of the year. That's what we saw today.

If we had reached eight billions with our revenues in 2024, that product was focused on this high speed service. This is the technology of these transmissions related to high speed. For example, USB PCIE SATA. Then we have a few ASIC projects. So here we have some ASIC projects.

The number of employees also reached more than 300 people. That is because we are actually an IC design company. So most of our resources are invested in RD-related parts of the workforce. So we can see that our RD share is about 80% or more. Our current headquarter is also a new store in Taiwan.

That's why we've also reached several important milestones today. One of them is that we've now shipped over 100 million million. That's 100 million pieces of this chip. Our technology starts from the actual USB, whether it's in host or device. It's the first product in the world to introduce such a product. It's also certified by the USB Association.

One of the advantages of this technology is that our current product is 100 million. One advantage of this technology is that our current product is our current product. It has been extended to the USB 20G and 40G part. Next, I would like to explain more about this product. Because I think investors may still want to learn more about the application of our company's actual product.

So this is the product of this product today, this is a limited product. And this is the product of this product is actually a limited product. We look at this middle of the product. Most of us do. It is actually used on desktop PC related applications. Especially in this high-end Workstation.

It's a lot more expensive than a laptop. It's actually a relatively small amount, because our stuff is actually on the motherboard, so we have to have enough space.

There are also some IPCs like these. There are actually our products inside. So we see the part in the computer. The part of the PC is mainly inside the host. The host is on the motherboard. So we see this picture in the top right corner.

It is a sign of our faith, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, and a sign of God's faithfulness.

This is one of our applications related to storage. Because our IP is mainly used for high-speed data transfer above. So you can see some advanced data transfer storage applications like this Multi-base Storage or NAS. In fact, it is a part of our product's main use.

It's like an external storage device like this. It's like an SSD or a traditional hard drive, and we all have a good business here. There are other things to do, such as Hub or USB2 PCIe NVMe.

As we've heard more and more about some of the terms that may be related to USB PCIe or SATA. How does one of these directions explain our company's technology and products? Basically, if we use this technology, it will be divided into these three parts. We'll first look at this USB section. The USB Controller for most of our products will be divided into HOS and Device.

It's like this part of the motherboard we've seen before. The Device is actually a part of our external products, whether it's a traditional hard drive or a USB part, there's another part of the HUB, the other part is that we're getting more and more attention about the PCI-related products. The main product is the Packy Switch, we have the Gen2 Gen3 Gen4 full product Rollmap here, and the other part of this product is the SATA-related application, but although it's Legacy, actually it's in the market this data transfer application is very wide, it has always been a very important part of our business, the other part of the words may be some smaller chips such as Redriver, Mux or even DisplayPort, some of the products we's DisplayPort, this time in the USB 4 solution, you can see it is a lot of the technology from the most complete 5G 10G 10G 20G to the current USB 40G we's, we's, we's to create this kind of this kind of this kind of the ACROM.

This is a very important part of our company's product and market strategy. That's why in fact, in 2024 and 2025, it's very important for us to have a lot of speed or performance requirements or AI driven needs before 2025, so we can see that the market is in fact the main application of 2025, we can actually see that there are a lot of other things in the strategy that we have to do before we start to plan.

In the future, we will continue to see some of the requirements related to the specification of the products, and even some of the premiums, etc. Now we can actually see that this is the same as this year we have the USB4 which started mass production this year, which is related to some of the related applications, and some of the management of some of the data such as Secure. In addition, this market is relatively stable, but in fact, in a stable market, you can see that the performance is really good, so as long as your technology is competitive in the last few years, we can actually promote a good growth of the company.

This is the reason why I believe that most people are more interested in this market than that of Premium, such as Gaming, or high-end applications, or AIPC, etc. In fact, most AIPCs may be more focused on this notebook than we believe that if we are more interested in coming into this market after some of the vendors in this area, we should have more ASIC opportunities here. What is more important is that because we see some different development in the market or more development, so we are also beginning to build our own strategy to find a more favorable direction in these markets, and the growth rate of these markets will be greater than we have in the past. The first part of AI is the third part of the automotive is the Niche market.

This is the only way to speed up the performance of this graphic card in this way, and that is to say that it can be used more and more of this graphic card, so it is not necessarily one you can add two or even more of the overall performance of this device should be the same thing that we now see is that there is a very significant advantage and convenience in the AI part of the other parts of the car, and the USB4 also has started a small amount of shipping to some of the car-related guests, but because at the beginning of the comparison, I think this part may be relatively small or less, but this will be one of the direction of our advanced applications is some RTXfor automotive, which will be with us or this year, if we have more information to share with you, it will be the next time we will be the next time we will be able to add more information about this technology. If you want to know more about ASIC, please let us know if it is more than 50% of the total revenue in the future. If you want to know more about ASIC, please let us know. If you want to know more about ASIC, please let us know. If you want to know more about ASIC, please let us know. If you want to know more about ASIC, please let us know. If you want to know more about ASIC, please do not hesitate to contact us.

There is nothing special about planning above, and we can provide some more information. Because we have collected some questions in advance to ask. Because I just mentioned some of the Package Switch of this PCIE, there is actually something like USB. But this year, we may have seen some of the Package Switch of this PCIE just mentioned in the consumer side, and there is something like USB. But this year, we may have seen some of the Package Switch of this PCIE in the consumer side, and there is something like USB.

I think the PC market and the Desktops market are relatively stable this year, but our business is actually good at the beginning of the year, which is mainly because some of the changes in the customer's market share will go in a better direction. So we think that this trend should not disappear in the short term or even in the next year, we think that the whole operation direction of the first three seasons of this year, we think it must be a pretty good state.

What else do you have to ask? We all welcome you to ask a question. For high-speed transmission or maybe a new generation of AI Server, there may be a new generation of USB4 generation with some PCIE related questions to raise your hand. Who else wants to raise your hand to ask a question? After that, Teresa asked the PCIE Switch, because Sample is ready to do it, so we can't update the time that we might see on the schedule when there will be revenue contribution and then Gen5 Gen5 can't update us.

OK, so if you don't have any other questions, let me know. Please don't hesitate to subscribe to our mailing list and get in touch with us today.

The third is that we think we're from this edge to the middle of the cloud. This is also important. Because we think we're just talking about the ability of this computing right now to the end of the edge. But in the future, we think there's a lot of this device like a phone for example.

It's a bit like a hybrid AI. It's a part of the application that you're going to care about as much as privacy. It's like comparing latency. Apps like low latency may run on the device side of your phone. But there are some more complex or require a lot of data. Or the language model doesn't have a way to handle those applications that might run in the cloud.

That's why connectivity in the middle is important. The ability to connect my device to the cloud. That's also important. MediaTek has long been at the forefront of the world in wireless communication with this wireless technology connection. That includes Bluetooth from WiFi and then to our short range.

As an example, at MWC this year, we also announced that we are the world's leading chip manufacturer that can reach this 5G advance NTN status. This network-tested ground satellite is now in progress. We believe that in the age of 6G, we will also be a leader in wireless communication.

So this part is also the third-most we think we will have in the future. That fourth is what we think is important to us. The entire industry chain also has this cooperation of the entire ecosystem. I think there are a lot of strong leadership partners in the industry chain.

Then there's this technology portfolio that's very complementary to NVIDIA's two companies along the way. So from the earliest cars we talked about to the Internet of Things. Then to monitor and then to GB10 that I just mentioned. And this time there's a fusion of the NV link at Computex.

We also believe that this is a very important and we have been working hard and continuing to invest.

And we have a very complete product line in 5G. So this part is what we think we will have the opportunity to see better progress in this product mix. So this is our place. So this is the part of our mobile phone. The second smart edge platform is the third part of our company's revenue in the first quarter.

We just mentioned a lot of this new product line below the smart edge platform. I may be a little bit more talking about this, because things are slightly different here. Including our connectivity, like WiFi, including Bluetooth, include models like 5G, etc. There are some things like this. There are solutions for Wire. Most of the revenue we make here is in the smart edge platform.

So we have a very complete product portfolio here. We observe that this year we have more than just technology migrations this year. From the earliest WiFi4 to WiFi5 to WiFi6. Now we are the world's leader in WiFi7. There are not many homes in the world.

So the migration of technology is also a profit mix enhancement for us. Then the average unit price is increased. In addition to WiFi, there is also a wire solution GPO to 10GPO, etc. Those we see in Telco, some routers have continued to have this higher penetration rate on some consolidation.

TV is also very important. We have a savvy market in the world. But this TV market is probably a market that follows the market. It is a stable market. This year, I think it is a stable market. A market is a stable market.

A market condition. Then we also have computing in the smart edge platform. The computing thing is like a tablet such as a Chromebook. This is where we have some Chromebook solution on the downstairs booth. That tablet we observe is AI adoption. Last year we started slowly on this mobile phone in the past two years and started slowly importing AI.

We found this trend to also start with penerate to other device computing tablets. That is a good example. Now we have gradually observed that tablet customers are starting to adopt the flagship SoC because of the functionality of AI. So here we are also beginning to see the whole upgrade of the product to make use of this AI-related application. So here we see the introduction of AI on this phone last year.

That's why we've also seen a pretty good performance improvement this year. There are some other things I've mentioned in the Smart Edge Platform, including the Enterprise AC customization chip I just mentioned, and so on. I've also mentioned one more thing about the car. Today, the center of the car is our Dimension Auto platform.

That's why we're currently working on the Smart Edge Platform. That's the third power IC. Power management accounts for around 5% of revenue in the first quarter. Of course, we're talking about the different types of devices we've just mentioned here, so some of them are built with my platform.

That aside, we are now looking forward to some new areas, including the Data Center section, and then Automotive section of the Power IC we are all parts of the world. This section of the Power IC we are all parts of the global car. Continued growth in the global market. So this is probably a quicker description of our product. The last one is Dividend. We distribute it twice a year.

So we also hope that we have the opportunity to grow up with this MediaTek together to seize the opportunity of AI. Thank you very much. We would like to thank Jesse for the wonderful sharing. And this is our Q&A session. If you have any questions, welcome to raise your hand and ask questions.

Then our staff delivered the microphone to you. Then our online friends can also hear your questions clearly. So now if you have any questions to ask Jesse, welcome to raise your hand. We would like to see what the current tariffs and exchange rates have to do with our operations. Thank you.

The more direct impact on tariffs is of course the US market. So the US market is not our biggest and final destination is not our biggest.

We are constantly looking at this situation, so we feel that no one can be affected at all. So here we can continue to communicate with our customers, then understand the market needs at the same time, we will also control our own inventory, our inventory management. Now we are all in the same situation when we have this relatively tight review exchange rate on a regular basis, and I think we are all affected by this. So our payouts are US dollars, so we are all in Taiwan dollars, so the most important thing is to look at this exchange rate fluctuation in the future.

There is no other way to ask questions, whether it is in the development of AI or even in the smartphone or even in this time, there is no other way to cooperate with Huida. We currently have Da Ba and the Eat that we are going to be listed in June. I would like to ask about future mergers and acquisitions or investment direction that may be going in the direction of what to do. Thank you, we will continue to have a team that has been watching most of our work and is more strategic with our industry or that it is possible to have leverage of these projects. It is not possible to compare what we are currently taking a more flexible alliance that may be part of our strategy, and it is probably not excluded that we want to do this.

I think we have chosen to go into the competitive products, such as COPY solution is the cabin system, like telematics self-communications If you look at the nature of technology, we have to talk about it a little bit later, so we think we need to go to catch up, but if you look at the nature of the technology, we are very confident that this gap should have the ability to reduce the gap in the world.

The most critical IP is the Certis IP. We now see more opportunities than we have in the industry. That's what we now have on the core of the business. Of course, we joined the MV. Link is a plus for us. Because I have more things to offer to my customers.

I would like to share with other companies our experience with NVIDIA in IP licensing. Both companies are very familiar with this business model. At the time of Tuesday, the company also came to Rick Keynote, and they also talked about this on the table. This part of the two company's RD team in the past I just mentioned that this series of deals from car to GB10 to some IoT, etc., are quite successful, so I will have one more case.

So I would like to point out that all of the advantages that MediaTek has come up with and we believe we can provide this value strategy value to the A-seq client. OK That's why we have a time relationship with our clients and if we have any questions about the advances in our investment, we have to ask the final question. That's why we have written a book that says we'll start next year that A-seq will contribute to the revenue of Billion USD. I want to ask him what the impact of the gross profit margin will be on us.

It is possible to maintain the current 47% gross interest rate and even increase the thank you. We have also answered this in our book of law. We are more concerned about the fact that he has an OP Dollar because of this case at the end of the day, so the amount for the company, regardless of whether it will go to EPS at Operating Dollar, to all of your dividend above is meanful. And then for Operating Margin is also Accredited. So that's why we now want to say that there will be more opportunities in the future, but this is what we are saying about the current opportunity in our law office.

We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so many years. We are grateful to those who have been there for so many years, and we are grateful to those who have been there for so many years.

Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) held an event on 6th to support the comprehensive upgrade of the innovation version, and officially canceled the restriction of qualified investors. The general investor can invest in the innovation version by signing the risk announcement. Over the years, investors in the qualified investors, about 300,000, once removed it became 13 million million. We hope that through the innovation version of Taiwan, not a boutique concept of operation, we hope that it can create more value, can attract more a new and emerging startup in Asia, can be listed in Taiwan, and then form another unique new industry in our capital market, Mr. Lin Shuming said, according to the past experience, innovation version of the company to go to the general version of the listing, the volume can be enlarged more than 5 times, greatly increase the liquidity.

In addition, the Securities and Futures Commission has also strengthened the review of the innovation of listed companies, and asked companies to hold a six-month legislative meeting, and communicate with investors more transparently. In the event of the event, the Vice Chairman of the Financial Management Committee, Mr. Chen Yanliang, Chairman of the Venture Capital Union, Mr. Chiu Decheng, and Mr. Liu Zhuangsheng, Chairman of the Venture Capital Union, came to support the event.

Some of the major customers of the world's top four brands, of course, there are some so-called channels, such as the U.S. Target, etc., or some U.S. department stores, such as Cose, such as some of the customers, of course, we also have a lot of customers, such as Dig Sporting Goods or Sketcher, so we also have a lot of customers, such as this kind of sports category, but we also have a lot of exposure to production chances, we now the biggest is Vietnam and Indonesia these two places, plus about 80% capacity, and is about 13% to 14%, the remaining digital part is scattered elsewhere, such as the Philippines, China, El Salvador, Bangladesh and other places. It may be that he first sees what he likes on the Internet, and walks into the store to figure out what he wants to buy the cheapest pair or which discount is the best, and then decides to buy this order. This is a basic mode of purchasing, which is generally a basic model, so because now everyone sees this very much information, which leads to a lot of things you want to refine, or want to buy the most favorite thing, and this is more likely to be the so-called customization, and the speed requirement is also raised, because if the current brand needs to maintain a certain competitiveness, he must pay more attention to inventory management and speed requirements, so now rarely hear what is called fast fashion brand, because now basically all the brand is very fast. This is why we feel that we have always felt or seen very good performance in the industry and that the customer also appreciate this piece, so we think that this continued long-term good business must be very helpful for Taiwan's future development is a little bit like that the current operation can be seen that the current category of clothing is about half of functional clothing sports category or some high-end functional clothing out of the category, etc. Or you can say that this is a thing of the saw fiber category is the main thing and half of the so-called fast fashion there are more traditional clothing that is similar to cotton is the main thing, so it also reflects that that the current balance is relatively balanced development of a particular product, but the requirement is that the market is the way the market needs to operate, we think that this is a very important project from the point of revenue point to say that we really value of the U.S.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T

After about two and a half years of inventory, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, a lot of the global clothing demand has returned to a restocking cycle. Although of course, there are many things that happen this year, many uncertainty factors, but after all, we now see a situation that the overall global inventory is actually relatively healthy compared to last year compared to last year. So as long as the basic needs of things are present, the focus is that you want to sell things now, rather than say that you may not like the difference.

This year's growth is relatively high compared to the customers we serve, which is the result of the same thing, of course, this year's uncertainty is the same as that this year's uncertainty is the same as that in the case of such a trend, some companies may serve a relatively diverse performance compared to its guests. For this reason, we think that the biggest challenge of this year's future outlook is the impact of tariffs and other uncertainties, of course, we communicate with all our customers in the actual fact that we do not know what the future tariffs will affect the current situation, so it can only be a little better for the current situation than the current situation of our customers. We believe that in the future, we are very confident that we will face some tariff uncertainty and other policy adjustments, but we think that in the future, we will have a certain ability to control all aspects of the ability of one should be or some of the suppliers of the customer's expectations can have some outstanding performance for that, of course, how we can not be clear, but what we can do in the future is to do as much as we will not regret a decision and try to see how the result is good, then let's just say that we can enter the next link thank you.

And then, of course, we also have online investment friends, so we hope that we can come to our community to see our discussion. I said first, after raising my hand, our staff will deliver the microphone to you, so that everyone can hear your question clearly, and then there is the answer on the stage. So now look at our Q&A time, some people want to raise their hand? Well, here please. Hello, I would like to ask you, we have seen the news today, that in Nike it has already planned to do a lot of things, so I don't want to say that the first thing that really seems like nothing to affect our industry, we have more than expected.

If you are looking for a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place to go.

In the first part of the clothing category, we actually do not see any pre-loaded situation, in fact, like we just said that in fact, in the years to do the progress of clothing industry, what is called rapid response, rapid response is that if there is a market demand, we may be able to ship within two weeks, because we believe that we hear fast fashion like Zara more than ten years ago said that he put things up in two weeks, but now the same conditions in each brand can be done, so that if the end demand is very high, two weeks before doing these preparation is enough, or because the clothing is not suitable for the wear and shoes it is different, clothing is very much affected by the weather, like the long sleeve is not to sell, winter short sleeves may not sell, shoes may not buy at all the difference, it is not too much, it is a lot, but the clothing is a lot of what we want to do is to do is to do with the customer.

We also have the highest rate of income from these guests. The profit you see for the ocean is actually much higher than that of many peers. A big part of that is mutual trust. That is, even now, we are very concerned about U.S. tariffs, etc., some kinds of uncertainty, etc. But in terms of our focus on the whole world, even if there is such an uncertainty, the U.S. is still a very good market. There is no place to replace it, especially in the sports category of clothing.

So we still think that this is a point of negotiation communication, the partner or a friend, of course, that everyone will be for their own interests, may be a little to protect a country, this is no problem. But you want to find a good partner with a friend, find a replacement, it is not easy. So I think it is, of course, that you can see that the United States is doing a lot of changes, but he needs to support one of his friends.

Yes, there is no relevant question, whether it is media friends or legal people have related questions to ask. OK OK, so that way today's performance or performance announcement, we first came to this place to tell a paragraph, but also with a warm applause to thank our spokesperson Lin, thank you for the wonderful sharing today, thank you.

This certification includes some of the local or municipal certifications that our factory belongs to a green factory. The product features crude acid fiber, so he is a raw material of a biological machine and can be biodegraded. So we have a lower carbon footprint compared to the raw material of a traditional petrochemical machine. In 2024, we got a domestic top 100 position for ESG in this business week, a look at the company, and we will continue to strengthen this environmental sustainability.

We've been working with them since 2022, and that's why we've been working with them for years, so it's even better to make sure that the quality of our products are even better than our peers. Finally, we've been developing some biodegradable products that include the materials we've just mentioned before, including the materials we're actively trying to make raw materials that go up and down again to make the HEC and MC, etc. That's just what we're talking about about when we're the best in 2000, and it's the number one in the union.

The amount of carbon emissions per tonne per tonne per tonne of our plant is 4.817, which shows that this carbon emissions above our plant is less than the average of our main sales customers. Of course, we will continue to strive to strengthen this carbon reduction or net-led goal. There is an ESG discussion about this sustainable environment, about 87. 6% of our environmental spending is mainly about the amount of environmental protection in this waste water treatment and environmental protection spending we continue to add to this environmental protection equipment every year.

What is the point of 2024, of course, is that there is no such thing as a super-target in our group's factories in 2023. There is this management of raw materials and recycling on top of this, our stroke chemistry, he produced more than 30% of the fine acids that we recycle by ourselves and then through some special process that he can restore to 99.95% of the acetate.

In addition, in 2024, the energy consumption intensity was also reduced by nearly 20% compared to 2023. These are the efforts we have made on a sustainable basis, including the two patents we have in cooperation with the Roman University of Italy, which we have also received in the past, the patent of which we have applied in the world, and the other is the recovery of pneumonia. The third part is in the operation outlook.

In addition, one of our guests is Philip Morrison, who has some tobacco alternatives included.

The city has the highest share of iQOOS, including this nicotine belt, which he has about 2024 about this kind of product, net revenue reached $150 billion, accounting for about 40% of the total revenue of Philip Morrison, which has more than 42% of the gross profit contribution. That just talked about this part of the smoke, in 2024, the amount of shipments reached 1397 billion, that is, more than the previous year in 2023, the compound growth rate just said that the market is more than three percent, and then there will be a lot of developed countries, including the United States, Brazil, etc., and even the mainland China, will continue to open this kind of product, which will be reviewed by the competent authority.

In addition to this, we also have a variety of other products, including Chanel, which is also known as a diacetate cellulose, which can be biodegraded, recycled, and restored. Our company also through the conversion of investment instrument company Holia and Zhongfeng new materials, etc., which continues to produce this diacetate cellulose, the application surface contains a lot of, just mentioned eye frames have a mobile phone, and there is a confident environmental protection this tableware, including this tool we often get, the handle of this tool, his raw materials belong to the acetate cellulose cellulose. Finally, our company another product is also made with diacetate cellulose cellulose cellulose cellulose, which we call his name forest, that is simply said to be the wood pulp, that is this is the most important component of wood pulp.

Well, the Group will set a few goals every year, of course, we still hope that the market will continue to expand and then seize the market share to more than 10%, the focus is that we want to see this market decline, we will be very active or fast to expand this factory. In addition, we also continue to develop some biodegradable products, which also grasp the development opportunities of the entire circular economy, and then we expect to maintain the return of more than 20% of the shareholders' rights, and then finally, the strengthening and implementation of some commitments to implement this environmental sustainability.

Our staff will give you a microphone, and then we can hear your voice clearly. Now the Q&A section to ask if there are any investment advanced or media friends who want to ask questions first. We can raise our hands to ask questions here. Hello. I would like to ask you, I saw the first quarter of the financial report, the parts of our inventory are the same as the remake, in fact, more than the fourth quarter of last year, double the amount, I would like to ask why.

I think the first season has always been the traditional spring season, so it is basically the first 10 days, this China's customs does not work, then this until the Lantern Festival will be serious start, so I think this is a very normal phenomenon, that is, in the first quarter of each year, there will be almost a month of customs to stop working, then this will be the case, so we will wait for the goods to be all the way out in the second quarter. Well, there is no media friend or investment advanced questions to ask.

This is the reason why we are talking about this trend as a green product. This kind of thing is that he can be degraded in the first place, and it can be regenerated. Just as our CFO has a FIC certification that every time he chops a tree, he will plant 10 saplings, which is which mountain he has a number. So this way, when you use the raw material, you know that he is a substitute for each other, and these are the questions that he will absorb CO2 when he is in this big chess light cooperation, so he is a green product.

If you are looking for a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place to stay. For us, this is not the real rival of this competition, because after all, isman has a fairly stable quality, and Isman, he has a quality effect, so I think, to be honest, I still have that sentence, is we will follow the quality of Isman, and then, in many of the advantages of this delivery, I believe that it can all be replaced, OK, OK, okay, because of the relationship of time, we thank the chairman, and also thank the chief financial officer, today's sharing, then, next to us, our next activity will begin at 3:20, then.

The total market is not good, here we have about loss of about 71 million of an impact, so this year we will distribute dividends about 1 billion dollars, and then there will be a cash dividend of 1,700 million, the entire profit and loss of the entire merger, then we look at the next page, in the asset representative part, we look at the total assets in 10 billion million million, compared to last year increased about 1.3 billion, mainly in the receivable part of the receivables about 2.4 billion and inventory reduction of 100 million, which is the response we just saw the first quarter's overall performance is growth. The total debt part is 39 billion, which is about 3 billion more than last year, the other part is due to dividends, because this year we will pay dividends about 1, the entire debt, the entire debt is 40%, the total debt is 40%, the total debt is about 1, that is about 1.7 billion, that is that is the only the only the part of this time we have to pay dividends. That is, he is also a global customer. For example, in the semiconductor equipment here, we have the United States and the European series of semiconductor equipment as our big customers, on the next page, the other one is not related to the robot, such as the detection, detection here is actually a bigger business source, which includes the defect detection ah OC scan code, etc. many different applications such as the AI and AR glasses combined with some SOP verification, etc.

This is one of the solutions to this video, which is used in the SERVER AI SERVER flaw checking above, which actually combines ROBA and the fault detection in the application of this Motion Planning path control for Heda with all our own AI flaw detection, what would be the difference in the past may be a flaw detection software we can only sell to $12 million, that through such a solution, for example, we sell to NVIDIA also sell to the U.S. companies also sold to the U.S. invisible braces, that can do this in a way that can be more than one million or more dollars. So we hope that by providing such a solution can increase our average price, this is not only the solution, the second is long-term but now does, is Jensen, this is not only this time from CES to Computex, and this concept is in fact that we have been in the future that we have to do this kind of the agent.

I think we have many clients already proven that our AI, when doing visual recognition, the amount of learning required is much less than the needs of our peers, and we are a big strength. That is, if you are an agent, if you are looking for someone to help you do things, agent, you don't want an agent to learn things slowly, so you will be less efficient, OK. On the top right side of that is that you want this Oba to not only need his hands, then the top right corner is to say, how your hands and feet can be precise, efficient.

So, we have to be able to connect with a lot of different robots, such as traditional robot arms, human robots, robot dogs, this AMR, drones, and so on. So, for the past seven years, in this AI, is to put a variety of robots and a variety of AI such neural networks, Motion these strings together, on one platform. That's what this would look like, if every engineer so concatenate, it's really a good time, so we built a platform, next page, this is a variety of hardware, we have to concatenate it, and then next page.

Manager, I would like to ask, because your first quarter gross profit margin YY is a recession, you can not tell the reason, then the second is that there are the gross profit margin of each product line, then there are 25 and 26 years of each product line is what is the gross profit margin, now look, thank you.

This gross profit margin overall, this Jack said, but this for each product, we do not do this break down. The first quarter of the gross profit margin has a recession, there are a few of the first batch of our product because of the entire revenue, the revenue has increased, some of the portfolio is less, then we have a small number of cases of the project, in fact, when receiving a certain amount of gross profit, when the season is recognized that the gross profit is relatively low, then the body's gross profit is, there is a little bit below.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Today, we welcome the chairman of the board of directors to come to the scene to ask some questions about the robot and AI development of the future, to ask the management team, the current part of our operating expenses will be for the next quarter will be maintained in Q1 this level, and then say that this year in the business cost section we will mainly spend on where, will increase, may also increase in a small increase because we are still human or RD human resources or continue to grow, marketing should be relatively small, marketing will be about the same, marketing will not be greatly increased, human resources may be, and then will increase some, thank you.

This is the first time that we have seen our business growth in the first quarter of the year, which is a quarter of our revenue growth in the first quarter of the year. This is a quarter of our revenue growth, compared to the quarter of our revenue growth in the first quarter of the year. This is a quarter of our revenue growth in 2025 Q1, a quarter of our revenue growth in Q11%.

This growth is derived from the data center here on the whole of the light of a jump wire and the demand for photovoltaic components increased, then in the business gross profit, our DQ business gross profit is 7 million, compared to the previous quarter 112% growth, which compared to the last quarter of last year there will be 233% growth, that gross profit margin, business gross profit, the first quarter has reached 17%, compared to the previous quarter in comparison to the previous quarter, compared to the first quarter of the year we have increased 9%. This part of the operating fee, the current first quarter is 77 million, compared to the fourth quarter has slightly growth, which is probably increased by 10 million, the same as the last year of the year DQ increase in this area, we need to explain that because there is still a deep technical layout in this area, so here, for our personnel, and for our RD, some technical development of research materials and some high-level R&D equipment investment, so that there is a trend trend is a trend of growth.

The whole coupled with our real estate and plant equipment, you can also see that we have been increasing in real estate and equipment and plant here, mainly because we began to have some automation equipment related to the components of the organs, so on March 31st, we reached 5.63 million, the total assets to March 31st, the total assets to March end of our total assets is 30.63 million, the liability part is 5.41 million, the shareholders interest part is 25.23 million 80%. Looking at the financial structure of our financial structure is relatively healthy and a very good financial structure, there is a benefit to the future development. The overall view is that we grew 53%, that from a different perspective, our main customers are still in the United States, so our US share is about 81%, the Asian portion is 12%, the China portion is 3%, then the EURO portion is 10%, then if the distribution of the amount, our US portion is the low dose is 19%, then China and China part because the number of days encountered the second page work is relatively short, so the direction of recession.

The EURO part is 100% growth, so we have a great growth here in the United States, Asia, China and Europe over the years. Next, let's talk about what we've developed over the years, what we've done, and some very important layouts with some Majestone. The main part is that we're working on three directions in this process of developing this CPU, the first is the AWARD part, the second is the part of technology, and the third is the equipment that we've been improving our automation.

In this part of the equipment, from Cable Assembling to NPO Assembling, to last year's LPO test line, the company's development is building a mass production line, and this supplier with the equipment for the future mass production of the equipment in some specifications. Well, next, we will talk to you in two directions to explain our performance, the first is the current product, and the second is the silicon light future development of the product. The current part of the product, our use of jump and light line in the data center is mainly based on the current large data center is a backbone professional structure.

The first part of the application will go from CPU with XPU to the CPU with switch to the CPU with XPU in one direction. We have been following this step of our customers to improve the development of our product. Then the most concerned is the development of this advanced technology, how do we do a layout. At present, we are in three directions, the first phase is LP, the first phase is LPO, and the first part is 1. 6T, then we have set up a production line in the fourth quarter of last year. That year's 4Q will do a mass production of a product, and then also provide a back-end system factory to do a system authentication.

This year's 4Q, due to the construction of this program, this year's 4Q to next year's 4Q, will build our production line, which is also expected to provide this product in the 3Q next year to provide this mass production verification and system factory to do system verification. In comparison to some high-bandwidth FAU of this part of this layout, we are currently carrying 3. 2T of this product, and now also doing product verification, which 4. 6. 4T is the 2Dimension's refarcam fiber array units, we are also in the design verification. The more important technology is the RMT to MMC cable, the RMT to MMC cable part is mainly a connector will be placed in the fiber array units.

And then our second field is an important field in the optical packaging of this technology, that is, the optical packaging technology is mainly to be the FAU precisely packaged in the PIC, our COOPER has a division of PIC and PIC, so to do a precise docking of this package. The other part is the 3 part, because the fiber array is very small, he is placed directly in this PIC, so the PIC to the middle of the system board need to be connected to the light, so we also in this 3 part of the design, a design is the RMT connector to the E Fiber array of RMT connector, the other connector is the MMC of this connector with our cable to do the connection.

So the 2D part is right, because our Fiber Array Unit is very small and very small, so its space is limited, so when your light is in line, it will have a light flux, a light flux limit. We are going to go in the direction of 2D, so the current development of this part of the Fiber Array Unit is greater than 6. 4T. So just look at this one, the next part of the LPU, the next part of the LPU, this 6T is the one on the right, is the one on the other side of the CPU, is the difference is where we can look at this part of the LMC.

So he actually put this Fiber Array Unit with light and NMC connector the whole is placed on the PCB board to do the docking, so he is still a plug-in way. The part of the CPU, he will be this light, here is a longer light, the whole will be shortened very short, that is very short, he will be directly with our Lens with our light with our connection, RMT's connection is here. So in fact, his development is a little bit less, from the LPU we can see him, there is actually a PCB board with a plug-able, and then he to the CPU part of his whole PCB board and plug-able will become one, this time will not exist, will be completely assembled into the PIC. Because last November the company said, we will not develop LPU, but we are really not really a lot of LPU in the process of the CPU process, but a lot of the CPU is a lot in the process, but also a lot of our customer is also a lot of the next time, so we want to meet the next time, we want to meet the next time, we have a lot of LPU. 200 million is sure to light it this year, will be spent, right, the other is can not go to that, is just that page, the next good, then the next good, this page, because now the industry has been talking about rubbish FAU, I want to clarify that the so-called rubbish is not the third part, should be said that the rubbish part is in this form, is more like the first way, he is a rubbish, the way exists, it should be said that there should be a rubbishable and detachable part, rubbishable compared to the previous part of this part of our transceiver.

This application is just to say that we have a lot of light source on the PCB board before transceiver, and now this plugable part will go to the is, his light fluorescent components will be integrated into the OIC this chip, and then to the COOPER here will do the docking, so we in this plugable this part, will not see all the light fluorescent components like the previous PCB is placed on the PCB board, the other part you talk about should be detachable, detachable part is he is, he has not with us to this FAU, put it in this PIC when there is no assembly precise way, he is anattachable way, so he can do one.

If you want to know more about this information, please do not hesitate to contact us. LPO part, because he is a plugable way, so he will be placed in the middle of this Pic is the connection back of the light connection, connector, the complexity of his design will be more complicated than the CO design of a model, then the CPO is a more than weaver level of the design of a model, then the other place is the LPO is a single, he is a one-piece, then the CPO is a package when he is doing the integration, is directly packaged to the Switch version or the XPU of the whole subtrade above the coop, and then he is here to deal with the technical difficulty, although we think it is 1 6T, but from the development process of the CPO from 1, 2T to 6. 4T to the higher bandwidth, then he will be higher bandwidth is a requirement of the base onweaver level of semiconductor and development. The 6T way is to put a lot of pairs and a lot of fiber array units around our switch IC or XPU, which means that his entire system version will become larger with his whole plan, so there will be some bottlenecks on the use and development of the whole performance. So in the future development point, if we look at some of the leading companies in the market, he will take some of the development of the bandwidth of the switch, and he will go up from the current 51. 2T to 110,102.1 4T and then he will run up, then when he has been up to the time, if you only 1.T this program will increase his total cost will be very large, then he will face a lot of energy consumption problems with his performance.

Ok, there is any investment advanced want to ask, because of the relationship of time, we may only accept the last question, this is rare, the last question, such as how we are with Taki electric current relationship is, Taki electric, sorry, because I am not, we do not publish this performance, we do not target a specific customer or a specific supplier to do a statement, that we are more from the company's point of view, we can provide a whole direction for investors to reference, okay, so today we first thank the chief financial officer, a warm applause, that we have before today.

Thank you very much for your participation today. Today, in fact, we have completed 25 successful events on this Taiwan Smart Technology Island. Thank you very much for your participation whether it is on-site or online. Thank you very much for your next visit.
