Then his broadband should be wide enough. So in VC implementation, the actual penetration rate in addition to Notebook and VGA are gradually starting to increase.

That said, if our company is an air-cooled heat dissipation module, in fact, we are a simple component is a maker of the main part. But when the market is in the water, we will become a system solution provider. So the solution provider, in addition to this is, of course, the original is the heat of our chip, we still know how to do it, right. We are codeplay, the former is HeSync, the water is now put codeplay, the liquid is put codeplay.

That's why it invests in the water-cooled part, the water-cooled part, we really research, at least 12 years, in this one. Well, that's our company's product history, we start from notebook, then back at VGA, Smartphone, Server, Automotive, and Liquid Cooling. So you can see that the company in the last 25 years, 25 years, every three to five companies will enter a new market, and that's probably the problem of density, because the larger the air-cooled module, the longer the longer you get the Rec chip, right. So it invests in the water-cooled part, the water-cooled part, we really study, at least 12 years, can say, at least 12 years, in this one piece.

The reason is that some of our customers in Europe and America, especially CSP customers, do Server, in 2020, we want CSP customers, and he wants us to diversify the production of a risk, so he wants us to be where we are now is China, and then add a new production line. We chose Thailand, so we are now in Thailand because we are not going to go there because of tariffs, we actually started to layout there as early as 2020. Well, next is that we should see a little bit in this diagram, the actual diagram is very basic to talk about why water is needed, and how to use fluid energy.

That's the response, you're the EU2EU3 is every standard rack, about 48U, then the EU is about 4.4 cm, well, there's a concept. So for example, today we say today is 4U high this HeatSync, actually it is a can be placed in 4U, you want a drawer concept, 4U drawer, the 2U HeatSync is placed in 2U high such. So you can see that the higher the actual wattage, the higher the actual U, even later you can go down to the bottom to see, now there are 6U to 8U is the solution of the chip. But you can imagine this 6U to 8U.

It's really a lot of space. Well, what is that? Of course, it's the core of the whole system. Copper is the material of copper. It's the structure of a U-shaped structure that you put in the water cooling system, and the water will flow past and take away the heat from the chip.

Well, that's why, if you're driving Liquid Cooling, you can increase your unit size. That's why you can increase your computing power per square feet. The density of your computing power is going to increase. Well, so we know it's because we know that the density of water is higher than the air. So water is actually more efficient to take away the heat of this chip.

That's 1. 2 1. 1 or less. Even some performance is better than 1. 6. 6 or less. Well, so the difference in the middle you want is that if I put the water cooled, I can increase my Cold Structure.

That's why we can save about 30%-40% of our electricity. That's why it's all about money. That's electricity, because now everyone has a lack of electricity. But that's a very important point, if you have a Data Center, your electricity is so big. But when you're going to upgrade to another system, you might still be the only one doing these things.

You only have to change the way you heat up, you have to increase your power. Well, that's the part. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution. That's what we can do with Total Solution.

This is Rake Manipal. This is just as welcome to our BOOST. This is our BOOST on the first floor. It is J0106 that he can see. It is a lot of things you can see there. It is Rake Manipal.

Then we put it on the back of the cabinet. Then it is Rake. Then it is Building Manipal. This is the building Manipal. This is even Coplay. We have to show the difference.

It's for AMD NVIDIA Intel. It's a different solution. That's why we even do ASIC Coplay. It's the ASIC Solution. But the ASIC part doesn't show. That's because it's customized.

This is the first of the two verses of the Qur'an, and the second of them is the Qur'an, and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the second of them is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

That's what we're talking about right now. Direct to Chip. It's the form of RAC. It's because Emergent Cooling. It's actually a topic.

That's with technology. It's less mature. It takes more time. It's research and development. At least Direct to Chip.

This is the beginning of the journey, and the end of the journey is the beginning of the journey, and the end of the journey is the end of the journey, and the end of the journey is the end of the journey.

This is the first of the two verses of the Qur'an and the second of the two verses of the Qur'an, and the second of the two verses of the Qur'an and the second of the Qur'an.

All of them are good; all of them are good; all of them are good; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad; all of them are bad.

This is the way of the righteous, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the righteous, saith the Lord.

This piping requires connection to. That's Isolated Cooling System. That's what I need. That's what I need.

That's why Liquid to Liquid. That's with Liquid to Air. That's the difference between it and Liquid to Air.

If you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place; if you are in the right place, you are in the right place.

That's what I have here. It's our company. It's a video. It's what we share with you. That's why we put it on YouTube. If you play Aura StickLiquid Cooling, you can play Aura StickLiquid.

You will see this movie, that is, you can search the website of the company, or the company's official website, that is, you can also have the movie, that is, the movie is telling us.

That's how Echo Play puts GB300. That's GB200. That's B200. That's either it's memory or not. That's not just CPU. That's GPU cold water.

Even memory is fanless. This is the concept of fanless. This is the whole fanless. This is where you can see it.

This is the part of the GB200. That is, it is CPU plus memory. That is, it is the solution of B200. That is the solution of the eight chips.

That's what you can see downstairs. That's why we also have a Center Detector. This is the device to prevent leakage.

We have a device to prevent water leakage. We want to talk about an NVL72 that is how Liquid to Air works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in water-cooled systems. We want to talk about an NVL72 that is how Liquid to Air works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in water-cooled systems. This is the concept of Building Manifold.

We can transport liquids from one pipe to another through this device. Then, this is In-Raw CDU. This device can transport liquids from one pipe to another. We don't need to use Fan. However, because Liquid to Liquid, it can get higher watts.

This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in the water-cooled system. Well, we will come back to the presentation. We want to talk about how the water-cooled system works. This device is designed to prevent liquid leakage in the water-cooled system.

Ok, so let's go to the Q&A section. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and wait a little while for the microphone to answer our questions. Then, of course, we will wait a bit for the microphone to answer our questions. Then, of course, we will wait for the microphone to answer our questions.

That microphone gives you this kind of online investment friends can also hear your problem clearly. So now Q&A links, do you have an investment advanced want to ask questions? Or media friends want to ask questions? So if you don't have any related questions, I'd like to ask you first, because I just mentioned that this year's part of the cold will be accounted for about 45% of the revenue.

So it's good to mention that this year's part of Yi cold will pull to about 40%. So if we mention that the part of the factory in Thailand is really much, most of us are doing water cold things. So it's not saying that this year's part of the factory in Thailand is probably very small, and it's probably from last year's about how much it is from last year's about how much it will pull from last year's about how much it might be this year's about how much it's going to pull from last year's about how much it's been this year to more than this year's maybe more than this year's? If you want to know how to do it, you can also do it. If you really want to do it, you can do it. If you want to do it, you can do it. If you really want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it. If you want to do it, we can do it. If you want to do it. If you want to do it, we can do it.

Today, we are going to have our second session. We are going to talk about some of our performance prospects and Q&A sessions. Just like the previous one, a company will have 30 minutes, the first 20 minutes we will ask H&A for a presentation, and then some financial and future development trends. The next 10 minutes are the Q&A section, so you can raise your hand, and of course, remember to use the microphone, because we have to be online, and there are also online audience friends to hear about the problem.

Well, first of all, I would like to introduce a simple history of our company since its inception. The company was founded in 2004, when the turnover was about 30 million dollars, the staff was about 70 people, and the main product at that time was the digital photo frame.

Then he decided to make a transition with the management of the company. Then repositioning our company's products and strategies to make this relatively high-speed transmission chip. Of course, this period also has a lot of effort. That was when our turnover reached 1.6 billion dollars in 2012, and we went on the stock market in Taiwan at the end of the year. That's what we saw today.

If we had reached eight billions with our revenues in 2024, that product was focused on this high speed service. This is the technology of these transmissions related to high speed. For example, USB PCIE SATA. Then we have a few ASIC projects. So here we have some ASIC projects.

The number of employees also reached more than 300 people. That is because we are actually an IC design company. So most of our resources are invested in RD-related parts of the workforce. So we can see that our RD share is about 80% or more. Our current headquarter is also a new store in Taiwan.

That's why we've also reached several important milestones today. One of them is that we've now shipped over 100 million million. That's 100 million pieces of this chip. Our technology starts from the actual USB, whether it's in host or device. It's the first product in the world to introduce such a product. It's also certified by the USB Association.

One of the advantages of this technology is that our current product is 100 million. One advantage of this technology is that our current product is our current product. It has been extended to the USB 20G and 40G part. Next, I would like to explain more about this product. Because I think investors may still want to learn more about the application of our company's actual product.

So this is the product of this product today, this is a limited product. And this is the product of this product is actually a limited product. We look at this middle of the product. Most of us do. It is actually used on desktop PC related applications. Especially in this high-end Workstation.

It's a lot more expensive than a laptop. It's actually a relatively small amount, because our stuff is actually on the motherboard, so we have to have enough space.

There are also some IPCs like these. There are actually our products inside. So we see the part in the computer. The part of the PC is mainly inside the host. The host is on the motherboard. So we see this picture in the top right corner.

It is a sign of our faith, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, a sign of God's faithfulness, and a sign of God's faithfulness.

This is one of our applications related to storage. Because our IP is mainly used for high-speed data transfer above. So you can see some advanced data transfer storage applications like this Multi-base Storage or NAS. In fact, it is a part of our product's main use.

It's like an external storage device like this. It's like an SSD or a traditional hard drive, and we all have a good business here. There are other things to do, such as Hub or USB2 PCIe NVMe.

As we've heard more and more about some of the terms that may be related to USB PCIe or SATA. How does one of these directions explain our company's technology and products? Basically, if we use this technology, it will be divided into these three parts. We'll first look at this USB section. The USB Controller for most of our products will be divided into HOS and Device.

It's like this part of the motherboard we've seen before. The Device is actually a part of our external products, whether it's a traditional hard drive or a USB part, there's another part of the HUB, the other part is that we're getting more and more attention about the PCI-related products. The main product is the Packy Switch, we have the Gen2 Gen3 Gen4 full product Rollmap here, and the other part of this product is the SATA-related application, but although it's Legacy, actually it's in the market this data transfer application is very wide, it has always been a very important part of our business, the other part of the words may be some smaller chips such as Redriver, Mux or even DisplayPort, some of the products we's DisplayPort, this time in the USB 4 solution, you can see it is a lot of the technology from the most complete 5G 10G 10G 20G to the current USB 40G we's, we's, we's to create this kind of this kind of this kind of the ACROM.

This is a very important part of our company's product and market strategy. That's why in fact, in 2024 and 2025, it's very important for us to have a lot of speed or performance requirements or AI driven needs before 2025, so we can see that the market is in fact the main application of 2025, we can actually see that there are a lot of other things in the strategy that we have to do before we start to plan.

In the future, we will continue to see some of the requirements related to the specification of the products, and even some of the premiums, etc. Now we can actually see that this is the same as this year we have the USB4 which started mass production this year, which is related to some of the related applications, and some of the management of some of the data such as Secure. In addition, this market is relatively stable, but in fact, in a stable market, you can see that the performance is really good, so as long as your technology is competitive in the last few years, we can actually promote a good growth of the company.

This is the reason why I believe that most people are more interested in this market than that of Premium, such as Gaming, or high-end applications, or AIPC, etc. In fact, most AIPCs may be more focused on this notebook than we believe that if we are more interested in coming into this market after some of the vendors in this area, we should have more ASIC opportunities here. What is more important is that because we see some different development in the market or more development, so we are also beginning to build our own strategy to find a more favorable direction in these markets, and the growth rate of these markets will be greater than we have in the past. The first part of AI is the third part of the automotive is the Niche market.

外接的方式就像是插SSD的方式只是說這個SSD它上面可以再放一個Graphic Card以這樣的方式來做加速那那它還可以並聯而且就是說它可以再串更多的這個Graphic Card所以說其實不一定是一個你可以加兩個甚至是更多所以對整體的這個設備的這個Performance提升應該也會是有就是我們現在看到的就是有蠻顯著的這個好處以及方便性那這個是在AI的部分另外在車用的部分的話我們的USB4其實也有開始小量的出貨到一些車用相關的客人裡面但是因為是在比較初期所以我想這個部分可能相對量還是比較少但是這個就會是我們往高階相關的應用的一個方向之一那第二個就是有一些RXTXfor automotive那這個就跟我們目前或是今年所做這個M&A比較有關係那這個後續我們如果有更多的這個訊息再跟各位做進一步的分享那另外一個部分就是Niche Market的部分或是一些Premium Market那因為其實這個是想說在過去營運策略很重要的一個部分就是我們會希望Focus在比較高附加價值的一些產品上面那像IPC或是一些比較進階的Storage的相關應用也都會是我們著重的那些方向那這邊的話其實可以看到就是說我們在技術的演進的過程或說規格升級的過程其實就帶動我們整個營收跟獲利的增加那我們自從2012年IPO了以後到現在其實我們的營收有增加的非常多那最下面這邊其實可以看到我們不同技術的這個發展的時間隨著我們新的技術推出來那我們從以USB來講我們從台灣第一個做到全球第一個那所以這個也帶動了我們相關的這個獲利能夠保持在一個非常不錯的水準那其實這個就是反映了我們產品競爭力的提升的部分那接下來的話呢因為過去其實我們主要是受惠於這個Spec Upgrade的這個Trend那未來來講的話其實我們會去Focus在更多像PCIE可能在不管是在AI或是相關應用上面甚至是更多USB40G 80G的這些產品上面那希望能夠藉由這樣子的一個規格的演進能夠找到更多新的市場的一些新的機會那我想因為時間的關係我就先跟各位update到這邊好了看大家有什麼樣的問題那好的我們先感謝Theresa剛才的分享那麼緊接著就要進入到我們Q&A的環節囉我們大概有10分鐘的時間稍後如果有問題的話我們可以舉手來發問那舉手之後呢我們的工作人員會給你麥克風這樣在線上的朋友也可以清楚聽到您的問題喔那麼有哪一些問題現在想要發問的可以舉手囉。 請問一下我們的大客戶在今年的營收占比是不是還是在五成以上左右那未來會有更多的合作機會嗎會是在哪些的應用方面謝謝當然我可能不大方便去comment單一客人那我想我們目前ASIC相關的專案其實佔營收五成以上是沒有錯那相關的這個市場需求我們看到是因為市場一些這個市佔率的一些變化那可能對我們是相對比較有利的所以我們看今年整體的生意我們是非常正面看待這一個部分的那除了這個ASIC另外的產品呢因為相關的高階產品也會與我們的自有品牌的host UFO的host也有關係所以我想UFO host這個部分也能夠額外再多貢獻一些不錯的營收。 後面那位就是我們的retriever的部分在ASIC的客戶因為現在很多講究這個成本的考量那我們有什麼策略是可以DesignWin這些ASIC的客戶Retriever這個產品因為他的競爭相對是比較多所以公司的策略上來講我們會比較focus在controller相關的部分因為我們覺得還是要選擇比較適合我們的一些市場跟這個方向可能會比較有利所以Retriever這邊可能短期之內不會有太多的琢磨。 後面我們幫忙閉一下麥克風Theresa那可以問一下就是說因為剛有提到大客人今年看起來狀況很不錯嗎那現在以客人的能見度來說是不是其實第三季就從營收的這個增速來說是還是可以維持像第二季這麼強勁嗎然後另外就是說對毛利率的幫助因為高UFO的host其實有一些貢獻嘛那想說也問問看有沒有在毛利率上有一個update的可能這個這個range謝謝是因為這個數字的方面我們可能不大方便去comment這件事情但是就趨勢上來講我想我們今年應該前三季看起來動能都蠻不錯的那主要就是因為A6這邊的這個專案的關係那我想應該方向上應該都蠻值得期待的啦那以獲利來講的話的確就是如果說我們能夠有更多自由品牌的生意的話像我們UFO host那對整體的這個毛利應該也會有一些幫助方向上我覺得今年我們基本上就是像法術會上講的還是維持差不多的這個毛利的目標去做區間目標。 OK還有哪一些投資先進有問題想要發問的嗎我們還有一些時間喔OK好我們未來還會有併購的就是計畫嗎那可能的方向為何謝謝目前我們會先focus在手上的這些project所以短期之內應該不會有什麼新的計畫我們對於這個文業的事股有相關規劃嗎目前我們對相關的投資應該還是維持一樣的想法並沒有什麼就是說在。

There is nothing special about planning above, and we can provide some more information. Because we have collected some questions in advance to ask. Because I just mentioned some of the Package Switch of this PCIE, there is actually something like USB. But this year, we may have seen some of the Package Switch of this PCIE just mentioned in the consumer side, and there is something like USB. But this year, we may have seen some of the Package Switch of this PCIE in the consumer side, and there is something like USB.

I think the PC market and the Desktops market are relatively stable this year, but our business is actually good at the beginning of the year, which is mainly because some of the changes in the customer's market share will go in a better direction. So we think that this trend should not disappear in the short term or even in the next year, we think that the whole operation direction of the first three seasons of this year, we think it must be a pretty good state.

What else do you have to ask? We all welcome you to ask a question. For high-speed transmission or maybe a new generation of AI Server, there may be a new generation of USB4 generation with some PCIE related questions to raise your hand. Who else wants to raise your hand to ask a question? After that, Teresa asked the PCIE Switch, because Sample is ready to do it, so we can't update the time that we might see on the schedule when there will be revenue contribution and then Gen5 Gen5 can't update us.

OK, so if you don't have any other questions, let me know. Please don't hesitate to subscribe to our mailing list and get in touch with us today.

The third is that we think we're from this edge to the middle of the cloud. This is also important. Because we think we're just talking about the ability of this computing right now to the end of the edge. But in the future, we think there's a lot of this device like a phone for example.

It's a bit like a hybrid AI. It's a part of the application that you're going to care about as much as privacy. It's like comparing latency. Apps like low latency may run on the device side of your phone. But there are some more complex or require a lot of data. Or the language model doesn't have a way to handle those applications that might run in the cloud.

That's why connectivity in the middle is important. The ability to connect my device to the cloud. That's also important. MediaTek has long been at the forefront of the world in wireless communication with this wireless technology connection. That includes Bluetooth from WiFi and then to our short range.

As an example, at MWC this year, we also announced that we are the world's leading chip manufacturer that can reach this 5G advance NTN status. This network-tested ground satellite is now in progress. We believe that in the age of 6G, we will also be a leader in wireless communication.

So this part is also the third-most we think we will have in the future. That fourth is what we think is important to us. The entire industry chain also has this cooperation of the entire ecosystem. I think there are a lot of strong leadership partners in the industry chain.

Then there's this technology portfolio that's very complementary to NVIDIA's two companies along the way. So from the earliest cars we talked about to the Internet of Things. Then to monitor and then to GB10 that I just mentioned. And this time there's a fusion of the NV link at Computex.

We also believe that this is a very important and we have been working hard and continuing to invest.

And we have a very complete product line in 5G. So this part is what we think we will have the opportunity to see better progress in this product mix. So this is our place. So this is the part of our mobile phone. The second smart edge platform is the third part of our company's revenue in the first quarter.

We just mentioned a lot of this new product line below the smart edge platform. I may be a little bit more talking about this, because things are slightly different here. Including our connectivity, like WiFi, including Bluetooth, include models like 5G, etc. There are some things like this. There are solutions for Wire. Most of the revenue we make here is in the smart edge platform.

So we have a very complete product portfolio here. We observe that this year we have more than just technology migrations this year. From the earliest WiFi4 to WiFi5 to WiFi6. Now we are the world's leader in WiFi7. There are not many homes in the world.

So the migration of technology is also a profit mix enhancement for us. Then the average unit price is increased. In addition to WiFi, there is also a wire solution GPO to 10GPO, etc. Those we see in Telco, some routers have continued to have this higher penetration rate on some consolidation.

TV is also very important. We have a savvy market in the world. But this TV market is probably a market that follows the market. It is a stable market. This year, I think it is a stable market. A market is a stable market.

A market condition. Then we also have computing in the smart edge platform. The computing thing is like a tablet such as a Chromebook. This is where we have some Chromebook solution on the downstairs booth. That tablet we observe is AI adoption. Last year we started slowly on this mobile phone in the past two years and started slowly importing AI.

We found this trend to also start with penerate to other device computing tablets. That is a good example. Now we have gradually observed that tablet customers are starting to adopt the flagship SoC because of the functionality of AI. So here we are also beginning to see the whole upgrade of the product to make use of this AI-related application. So here we see the introduction of AI on this phone last year.

That's why we've also seen a pretty good performance improvement this year. There are some other things I've mentioned in the Smart Edge Platform, including the Enterprise AC customization chip I just mentioned, and so on. I've also mentioned one more thing about the car. Today, the center of the car is our Dimension Auto platform.

That's why we're currently working on the Smart Edge Platform. That's the third power IC. Power management accounts for around 5% of revenue in the first quarter. Of course, we're talking about the different types of devices we've just mentioned here, so some of them are built with my platform.

That aside, we are now looking forward to some new areas, including the Data Center section, and then Automotive section of the Power IC we are all parts of the world. This section of the Power IC we are all parts of the global car. Continued growth in the global market. So this is probably a quicker description of our product. The last one is Dividend. We distribute it twice a year.

So we also hope that we have the opportunity to grow up with this MediaTek together to seize the opportunity of AI. Thank you very much. We would like to thank Jesse for the wonderful sharing. And this is our Q&A session. If you have any questions, welcome to raise your hand and ask questions.

Then our staff delivered the microphone to you. Then our online friends can also hear your questions clearly. So now if you have any questions to ask Jesse, welcome to raise your hand. We would like to see what the current tariffs and exchange rates have to do with our operations. Thank you.

The more direct impact on tariffs is of course the US market. So the US market is not our biggest and final destination is not our biggest.

We are constantly looking at this situation, so we feel that no one can be affected at all. So here we can continue to communicate with our customers, then understand the market needs at the same time, we will also control our own inventory, our inventory management. Now we are all in the same situation when we have this relatively tight review exchange rate on a regular basis, and I think we are all affected by this. So our payouts are US dollars, so we are all in Taiwan dollars, so the most important thing is to look at this exchange rate fluctuation in the future.

There is no other way to ask questions, whether it is in the development of AI or even in the smartphone or even in this time, there is no other way to cooperate with Huida. We currently have Da Ba and the Eat that we are going to be listed in June. I would like to ask about future mergers and acquisitions or investment direction that may be going in the direction of what to do. Thank you, we will continue to have a team that has been watching most of our work and is more strategic with our industry or that it is possible to have leverage of these projects. It is not possible to compare what we are currently taking a more flexible alliance that may be part of our strategy, and it is probably not excluded that we want to do this.

I think we have chosen to go into the competitive products, such as COPY solution is the cabin system, like telematics self-communications If you look at the nature of technology, we have to talk about it a little bit later, so we think we need to go to catch up, but if you look at the nature of the technology, we are very confident that this gap should have the ability to reduce the gap in the world.

The most critical IP is the Certis IP. We now see more opportunities than we have in the industry. That's what we now have on the core of the business. Of course, we joined the MV. Link is a plus for us. Because I have more things to offer to my customers.

I would like to share with other companies our experience with NVIDIA in IP licensing. Both companies are very familiar with this business model. At the time of Tuesday, the company also came to Rick Keynote, and they also talked about this on the table. This part of the two company's RD team in the past I just mentioned that this series of deals from car to GB10 to some IoT, etc., are quite successful, so I will have one more case.

So I would like to point out that all of the advantages that MediaTek has come up with and we believe we can provide this value strategy value to the A-seq client. OK That's why we have a time relationship with our clients and if we have any questions about the advances in our investment, we have to ask the final question. That's why we have written a book that says we'll start next year that A-seq will contribute to the revenue of Billion USD. I want to ask him what the impact of the gross profit margin will be on us.

It is possible to maintain the current 47% gross interest rate and even increase the thank you. We have also answered this in our book of law. We are more concerned about the fact that he has an OP Dollar because of this case at the end of the day, so the amount for the company, regardless of whether it will go to EPS at Operating Dollar, to all of your dividend above is meanful. And then for Operating Margin is also Accredited. So that's why we now want to say that there will be more opportunities in the future, but this is what we are saying about the current opportunity in our law office.

We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so long. We are grateful to those who have been there for so many years. We are grateful to those who have been there for so many years, and we are grateful to those who have been there for so many years.

Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) held an event on 6th to support the comprehensive upgrade of the innovation version, and officially canceled the restriction of qualified investors. The general investor can invest in the innovation version by signing the risk announcement. Over the years, investors in the qualified investors, about 300,000, once removed it became 13 million million. We hope that through the innovation version of Taiwan, not a boutique concept of operation, we hope that it can create more value, can attract more a new and emerging startup in Asia, can be listed in Taiwan, and then form another unique new industry in our capital market, Mr. Lin Shuming said, according to the past experience, innovation version of the company to go to the general version of the listing, the volume can be enlarged more than 5 times, greatly increase the liquidity.

In addition, the Securities and Futures Commission has also strengthened the review of the innovation of listed companies, and asked companies to hold a six-month legislative meeting, and communicate with investors more transparently. In the event of the event, the Vice Chairman of the Financial Management Committee, Mr. Chen Yanliang, Chairman of the Venture Capital Union, Mr. Chiu Decheng, and Mr. Liu Zhuangsheng, Chairman of the Venture Capital Union, came to support the event.

全球前四大品牌的一些主要客人,那當然還有一些所謂的一些通路商,像美國的Target等等,或者是一些美國的百貨公司,例如像Cose這一類一些客人,那當然我們這幾年也往這個功能類跟運動服在那個邁進,所以我們也有接很多客人,例如像這個運動類別的Dig Sporting Goods或者是Sketcher這一類的一些客人,我們也都有一些接觸生產機率,我們目前最大的就是越南跟印尼這兩個地方,加起來大概占到80%的一個產能,還有就是潔普在大概有13%到14%左右,剩餘的一個個位數部分就是分散在其他地方,例如菲律賓,中國,薩爾瓦多,孟加拉等地。 我們認為是說未來的一個成衣製造的話,基本上就是除了全球佈局以外當然就是大者恆大,這個大者恆大的趨勢其實主要還是因為是說客人現在要求的一些服務是越來越廣,這個也大幅的增加整個一個要進入這個產業的一個門檻,所以不像以前你光是說你可以提供一些設計研發能力你就算不錯,但是你現在也必須做很多數據分析或者是一些材質開發甚至是一些未來前瞻性的一些技術的一些共享或者是一些資訊分享或者是ESG等等的一些相關的技術才有辦法長期的吸引客人去合作跟服務,所以也因為這樣的一個門檻越來越高,所以做的好的供應商其實成長性在過去幾年都大於他服務的客人。 所以這也是為什麼是說有很多一些台灣的同業在這個國際上的客人在這個國際的一個舞台上可以非常的耀眼就是因為是說其實台灣在這個領域一直的一個努力的一個合作是大家有目共睹的非常的好的那當然除了剛才講這些的話我們覺得是說未來的發展一定還是以速度導向為主,那主要這跟各個消費者的一個消費習慣的改變,因為現在的消費者其實基本上不是只是單純的去逛街買衣服這樣子而已,而是說很多的一個服務室類的採購習慣已經是結合所謂的線上跟線下的一個綜合體。 他可能在網路上先看到自己喜歡的東西,走進店裡頭去摸摸看他想要的東西到底長什麼樣再去網路上找哪個地方買最便宜對或者是哪裡的折扣最好,後來才做才決定下這個訂單,這是普遍現在的一個採購的一個基本模式,所以也因為現在大家看到的這個大家都非常的資訊非常的多導致可能你想要精打細算也好或者是想要買到最喜歡的東西也好這個都更偏向所謂的客製化還有就是那個速度要求也提升也因為這樣的一個模式導致如果現在的品牌需要維持一定的競爭力他必須更重視庫存管理以及速度的要求,所以現在已經很少聽到什麼叫快時尚的品牌了,因為現在基本上全部的品牌都非常的快。 所以不管是那個運動服類別時尚類別甚至是一些其他特殊規格類別,大概都是這個模式,所以快時尚已經是一個過去的詞了現在的話你哪一個品牌你看得到大概都非常的快了還有一個重點當然就是ESG的重視我們覺得台灣有一點做得比其他的地方相對的更讓客人讚賞的就是我們整體的一個透明度跟願意合作配合的一個揭露度相對是高的,所以在很多歐美客人針對整個永續發展或者是ESG的一個要求的時候,他們首先會更喜歡跟台灣的企業合作基本上就是說在這一類的一些環節裡面,他們比較需要不太需要擔心太多的事情可以更專注在跟台灣的企業來找尋如何更互惠的一個合作模式。 這個是我們覺得我們一直都覺得自己或者是看到同業表現非常不錯而且客人也滿讚賞這一塊,所以我們覺得這個繼續長期的好好經營一定對台灣的未來發展非常的有助力對那這個就稍微等一下那目前講到一個營運可以看到就是說目前巨羊的成衣的類別大概一半是機能服像運動類別的或者是一些外出類的一些高端機能服等等的或者是說你可以講說這個就是鋸子纖維類的一個東西為主還有一半就是所謂的快時尚還有一些比較傳統服飾那這個就比較像是棉類的東西為主所以大概各一半一半所以這也反映了就是說巨羊目前的一個平衡性相對於一些同業來講是比較均衡發展的我們不太完全單一的專注在某一個特別的產品可是要求的就是所賣的東西都是市場需要的那以營運的方式來講的話我們覺得這個就是一個很重要的一個項目以營收的角度來講可以看到說我們其實非常重視美國市場這一塊即使經過了這三十幾年的一個深耕大概美國的品牌還是占到百分之七十以上那這個就跟我們公司的一個特性有關就是剛剛我們講的就是說因為我們重視的一個文化是一個透明度高然後很坦誠跟大家互動的一個模式那這個深得美國客人的一個喜愛所以這也導致說我們其實跟美國客人的一個合作一直以來就是每一年都越來越來的越好那當然亞洲這邊的一個部分其實大部分都是以日本的品牌為主對所以這個部分也是因為日本的品牌在這幾年的一個發展有目共睹的好還有就是他們也是放眼全球佈局所以他們也很希望能夠依賴已經有全球佈局能力尤其是歐美市場經驗的一些供應商跟他搭配合作所以這也是我們想要的一個目的就是為什麼說我們日系客人這邊的一個成長大概每年都是很穩定的這樣子的一個也不能講細水長的因為這個水不細喔對所以應該也算是一個很蓬勃發展的一個市場所以我們覺得也是長期看好它那首先先講一下就是說今年的第一季其實可以看到就是我們的營收還有就是整個的一個毛利率的表現都比預期來的稍微好一點營收有雙位數的年增成長喔那這主要才受惠於說。

After about two and a half years of inventory, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, a lot of the global clothing demand has returned to a restocking cycle. Although of course, there are many things that happen this year, many uncertainty factors, but after all, we now see a situation that the overall global inventory is actually relatively healthy compared to last year compared to last year. So as long as the basic needs of things are present, the focus is that you want to sell things now, rather than say that you may not like the difference.

對那這邊是一個目前的一個產能一個規劃就是當然今年的一個不確定性比較大但是不過也可以看到說過去的幾年的話大概大部分的時間那個巨羊的相對的一個成長跟需求是穩定的就是說它的成長性相對於我們服務的客人來講是比較高一點的那這個就是反映說大者恆大所以供應商集中帶來的一個效益所以當然說今年的不確定性比較大不過就一樣就是說在這樣的一個趨勢那個的情況之下大概服務比較好比較多元的像巨羊這一類的一些公司可能它相對的一個表現跟它的客人比起來是有一些的一個支撐的。 對那當然講了很多的一些過去的東西還是講一下今年未來的展望我們覺得當然今年最大的一個挑戰就是在所謂的一個關稅等等的不確定性的影響當然我們跟我們全部的客人溝通過的一個結論就是實際大家也不知道到今年底整個關稅會長什麼樣子對那太過度的擔憂未來的事情實際也沒有辦法影響目前的一個整體的狀況所以只能針對說已經在目前的狀況之下我們在目前的一個當下能做的事情去把它去做得更好一點。 我們還是認為說巨羊的優勢是在它是在東南亞生產的一個主要的一個成銀製造商它的優勢就速度快而且在一個相對跟歐美相對關係比較穩定的一些地區去做生產所以客人也很看重這一類的一些供應商未來跟它的一個發展雖然目前關稅的一個價格還不確定不過目前的一個共識就是說這個關稅的影響可能今年還是會有的只是說因為我們也不知道什麼時候這個才可以轉嫁給終端消費者那大家也在想一個更好可以處理跟一起對應這個目前關稅的一個影響的一個最好結果。 我們目前是在一個所謂舊的規則都被打破還在建立新規則的一個階段當然在這個不確定性的時候必須要表現出來的一個方法就是一個更好的配合度跟韌性因為當然你什麼東西都不能做可是一旦有一個打破過去那個習慣的一個情況發生的時候一定是這個時間是比較困難一點的不過像我們跟客人的討論也是認為是說這個的轉換期當然到最後一定會某一些他們認為表現更好或更穩定的供應商會因此而受惠可是這個受惠的時間可能是在新的規則建構之下或之後的一個情況下可能到時候可以發展的一個機會是更好的可是今年可能要花一季到兩季的時間去真正了解各國需要跟想要的未來是長什麼樣子擬構好一個未來大家都可以認同的一個長相跟狀況之後的話在各個供應商去提供它該有的一些服務。 所以我們認為是說當然這個這一類的一個調整我們過去也經歷過很多次對那每一次的一個這樣的一個挑戰其實就是一個轉機像好比說像疫情的時候大家一開始也會非常的擔心可是事實也證明是說準備好的公司適應了那個環境之後也可以慢慢的或甚至很快速的就反映出來的時候這個最後的一個表現也非常的亮眼所以我們認為是說以具養目前對於客人的一個了解跟他的合作的深度等等的我們是非常的有信心在未來雖然說會面臨一些關稅不確定性還有一些政策不確定性的一個調整的一個影響可是在那之後的話我們認為是說以一個我們目前的一個能力還有各個各方面的一個掌握應該還是在客人相對希望的一些供應商裡面可以有一些突出的一個表現對那當然就是我們當然未來怎麼樣大家不能說得很清楚可是我們能做的就是盡我們所能去做我們覺得絕對不會後悔的一個決策跟努力看看最後的一個結果是怎麼樣好那這邊就先告一段落謝謝大家的一個耐心那我們接下來可以進到下一個環節謝謝。

然後當然因為我們還有線上的投資朋友們,所以我們也希望大家可以來到我們的社群上來看我們的討論。 那我先先提一提說,舉手之後呢我們的工作人員會遞麥克風給您喔,這樣子大家都可以清楚的聽到您的問題,然後還有台上的回答。 那麼現在就看我們的Q&A時間,有人想要舉手發問的嗎? 好的,這邊請。 你好,我想請教一下,今天我們已經有看到新聞,就是說在Nike它已經規劃要做蠻多品項的一個漲價,那我想我不知道說第一個這個當然實際上好像也沒有什麼影響到我們的行業,我們比大家預期的再更早一點,那我想問兩個問題,第一個就是說,我當然理解Nike不是我們的客戶,但我不知道說在Nike漲價這個效應之下,我們的客戶這一邊的這個漲價有沒有機會是比較早,第二個我想問的就是說,如果在客戶端這邊漲價比較順利,那我們之後在這個關稅的這個影響,有沒有機會是會有一些比較不一樣的樣貌,謝謝。 好,那這個問題其實非常好,也是一個大家非常想要的知道的一個問題,我先回答第二個,就是說一旦漲價就代表這個很多,實際上關稅就是一個額外的費用,費用增加很單純就是這樣子,漲價就是把費用增加這件事情轉給消費者,簡單講就是這樣子,那當然漲價這件事情會帶來一個社會的問題,實際上比大家看到的更高,對所以大部分的,大部分的品牌是不輕易去講漲價這件事情,因為這個影響的不是只是品牌形象,也是整個國家的消費等等未來的經濟發展總體都會有些影響,簡單講就是說如果真的漲價了,對應該這個對於供應商跟品牌的這個成本壓力就會放緩,這個是邏輯上都是這樣子,對可是事實上比這個複雜,因為你漲價的一個負面效果也很直接,除非你是一個無可替代,就是說非你不可,可能像某一些高端的一些像晶片等等的,它有一個這種的一個獨特性,它漲價是那個完全可以轉嫁給它的一個消費者,因為大家都需要它,可是從十一住行這些服飾類的角度來講,除非它這個品牌有一個非常超越其他品牌的一個優勢存在,那種的漲價才不會影響它的一個銷售數量,這是一個最現實跟最務實的一個問題。

If you are looking for a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place to go.

In the first part of the clothing category, we actually do not see any pre-loaded situation, in fact, like we just said that in fact, in the years to do the progress of clothing industry, what is called rapid response, rapid response is that if there is a market demand, we may be able to ship within two weeks, because we believe that we hear fast fashion like Zara more than ten years ago said that he put things up in two weeks, but now the same conditions in each brand can be done, so that if the end demand is very high, two weeks before doing these preparation is enough, or because the clothing is not suitable for the wear and shoes it is different, clothing is very much affected by the weather, like the long sleeve is not to sell, winter short sleeves may not sell, shoes may not buy at all the difference, it is not too much, it is a lot, but the clothing is a lot of what we want to do is to do is to do with the customer.

We also have the highest rate of income from these guests. The profit you see for the ocean is actually much higher than that of many peers. A big part of that is mutual trust. That is, even now, we are very concerned about U.S. tariffs, etc., some kinds of uncertainty, etc. But in terms of our focus on the whole world, even if there is such an uncertainty, the U.S. is still a very good market. There is no place to replace it, especially in the sports category of clothing.

So we still think that this is a point of negotiation communication, the partner or a friend, of course, that everyone will be for their own interests, may be a little to protect a country, this is no problem. But you want to find a good partner with a friend, find a replacement, it is not easy. So I think it is, of course, that you can see that the United States is doing a lot of changes, but he needs to support one of his friends.

Yes, there is no relevant question, whether it is media friends or legal people have related questions to ask. OK OK, so that way today's performance or performance announcement, we first came to this place to tell a paragraph, but also with a warm applause to thank our spokesperson Lin, thank you for the wonderful sharing today, thank you.

This certification includes some of the local or municipal certifications that our factory belongs to a green factory. The product features crude acid fiber, so he is a raw material of a biological machine and can be biodegraded. So we have a lower carbon footprint compared to the raw material of a traditional petrochemical machine. In 2024, we got a domestic top 100 position for ESG in this business week, a look at the company, and we will continue to strengthen this environmental sustainability.

We've been working with them since 2022, and that's why we've been working with them for years, so it's even better to make sure that the quality of our products are even better than our peers. Finally, we've been developing some biodegradable products that include the materials we've just mentioned before, including the materials we're actively trying to make raw materials that go up and down again to make the HEC and MC, etc. That's just what we're talking about about when we're the best in 2000, and it's the number one in the union.

The amount of carbon emissions per tonne per tonne per tonne of our plant is 4.817, which shows that this carbon emissions above our plant is less than the average of our main sales customers. Of course, we will continue to strive to strengthen this carbon reduction or net-led goal. There is an ESG discussion about this sustainable environment, about 87. 6% of our environmental spending is mainly about the amount of environmental protection in this waste water treatment and environmental protection spending we continue to add to this environmental protection equipment every year.

What is the point of 2024, of course, is that there is no such thing as a super-target in our group's factories in 2023. There is this management of raw materials and recycling on top of this, our stroke chemistry, he produced more than 30% of the fine acids that we recycle by ourselves and then through some special process that he can restore to 99.95% of the acetate.

In addition, in 2024, the energy consumption intensity was also reduced by nearly 20% compared to 2023. These are the efforts we have made on a sustainable basis, including the two patents we have in cooperation with the Roman University of Italy, which we have also received in the past, the patent of which we have applied in the world, and the other is the recovery of pneumonia. The third part is in the operation outlook.

In addition, one of our guests is Philip Morrison, who has some tobacco alternatives included.

The city has the highest share of iQOOS, including this nicotine belt, which he has about 2024 about this kind of product, net revenue reached $150 billion, accounting for about 40% of the total revenue of Philip Morrison, which has more than 42% of the gross profit contribution. That just talked about this part of the smoke, in 2024, the amount of shipments reached 1397 billion, that is, more than the previous year in 2023, the compound growth rate just said that the market is more than three percent, and then there will be a lot of developed countries, including the United States, Brazil, etc., and even the mainland China, will continue to open this kind of product, which will be reviewed by the competent authority.

In addition to this, we also have a variety of other products, including Chanel, which is also known as a diacetate cellulose, which can be biodegraded, recycled, and restored. Our company also through the conversion of investment instrument company Holia and Zhongfeng new materials, etc., which continues to produce this diacetate cellulose, the application surface contains a lot of, just mentioned eye frames have a mobile phone, and there is a confident environmental protection this tableware, including this tool we often get, the handle of this tool, his raw materials belong to the acetate cellulose cellulose. Finally, our company another product is also made with diacetate cellulose cellulose cellulose cellulose, which we call his name forest, that is simply said to be the wood pulp, that is this is the most important component of wood pulp.

Well, the Group will set a few goals every year, of course, we still hope that the market will continue to expand and then seize the market share to more than 10%, the focus is that we want to see this market decline, we will be very active or fast to expand this factory. In addition, we also continue to develop some biodegradable products, which also grasp the development opportunities of the entire circular economy, and then we expect to maintain the return of more than 20% of the shareholders' rights, and then finally, the strengthening and implementation of some commitments to implement this environmental sustainability.

Our staff will give you a microphone, and then we can hear your voice clearly. Now the Q&A section to ask if there are any investment advanced or media friends who want to ask questions first. We can raise our hands to ask questions here. Hello. I would like to ask you, I saw the first quarter of the financial report, the parts of our inventory are the same as the remake, in fact, more than the fourth quarter of last year, double the amount, I would like to ask why.

I think the first season has always been the traditional spring season, so it is basically the first 10 days, this China's customs does not work, then this until the Lantern Festival will be serious start, so I think this is a very normal phenomenon, that is, in the first quarter of each year, there will be almost a month of customs to stop working, then this will be the case, so we will wait for the goods to be all the way out in the second quarter. Well, there is no media friend or investment advanced questions to ask.

This is the reason why we are talking about this trend as a green product. This kind of thing is that he can be degraded in the first place, and it can be regenerated. Just as our CFO has a FIC certification that every time he chops a tree, he will plant 10 saplings, which is which mountain he has a number. So this way, when you use the raw material, you know that he is a substitute for each other, and these are the questions that he will absorb CO2 when he is in this big chess light cooperation, so he is a green product.

其實有一點甚之不武,那麼,其實最重要一點是我們每一天都在漲進,每一天都在改善我們的品質,所以呢,其實我們就算是沒有關稅的問題,我們一樣的會取代他,為什麼呢,因為現在很多的這個房子業,他有pattern,他有這個passion designer,等到他接到單子的時候,他再叫伊斯曼從美國再送過來的時候,兩個月以後了,對於我們來講,在地的,馬上你打個電話,我們就可以把你要的規格然後立刻送到你的工廠去,也許一周之內,對於他,後續再往下交,那基本上來講會有先天的優勢啦,所以說基本上來講,我覺得在整個這個未來的趨勢裡頭,那麼初晨行為呢,他是代替一個蠶絲的效果,一個絲綢,大概一頓48萬,那麼對於這個初見來講,一頓才8萬,那麼這樣子的話呢,他的對於這個整個蠶絲的效果的取代度,是有相當大的一個優勢的。 蠶絲有做什麼呢,其實各位都常注意到,很多印度的沙粒,那麼中東的這些白袍常常都是這一類東西,但是這樣子的話,成本可以降低很多,所以我想,這個蠶絲的這個長勢呢,會為以後的這個產業界的發展,會有創造很大的這個產值空間。 好的,我們時間關係,有後面的這位先生,最後一題,那董事長想要請問一下,就是因為在長勢這一塊的話,是有提到就中國這邊的需求是一年25000噸,然後,但是148那邊供給是一年1萬噸,那中間的這個GAP的話,過往是由當地的廠商去米貧,這段中間的GAP嗎,還是或者是有其他廠商去協助這個GAP去米貧,我這個很害怕,你們這樣子的這個這個這麼聰明的投資者,馬上可以抓到這個問題點,實際呢,這個確實是的有一個第3家的這個製造商,我們大概可以供應一年,可以供到4000到5000噸啦,另外還有一家,就是北歐三小國的立陶宛,立陶宛,他這個是一個舊蘇聯地區的一個舊的產銷線號,那麼所以呢,基本上來講,立陶宛那時候呢,是經過海陸跟中歐鐵路,是有相當的部分到這個中國大陸的,但是呢,因為這個是一個非常舊的產線,當初義大利人設計的,所以他的品質實際上是一個非常參差不齊的。 對於我們來講呢,這個不在於這個真正的這個競爭的對手,因為伊斯曼畢竟有一個相當大的穩定的這個品質,而且伊斯曼的,他有一個品質的這個效果,所以呢,我覺得就是說,認真的來講,我還是那句話,就是我們會在品質上追評伊斯曼,然後呢,在很多的這種這個交貨的優勢上,那和客戶的配合上,我相信能夠全部這個取代,OK,好,那因為時間的關係喔,我們感謝董事長,也感謝財務長,今天的分享,那麼呢,緊接著我們,我們後面的一段活動,將會在3點20分的時候來開始展開,那麼。

股票整個市場不好,這邊我們大概虧損的大概損失了大概有7100萬的一個影響,所以本在稅前的稅後的一個經歷是1310萬,那EPS在0. 07元,這在整個合併的一個損益的部分,那接下來我們看下一頁,在資產物代表部分,我們看一下總資產在100億7100萬,較去年大概增加了大概1. 3億左右,主要是在應收賬款部分大概有增加2. 4億跟存貨這邊減少1億,那這也就呼應我們剛才看到第一季的整體的一個業績是有成長的。 那總負債的部分是39億9千萬,那較去年大概增加3億,那其中在應付賬款部分增加6千萬,那在另外一部分是應付股利的部分,因為我們今年要分發股利大概是1塊錢,所以這邊應付股利大概有1. 7億的一個應付股利的一個負債,整個負債比大概是40%,那股東權益的部分是60億8千萬,較去年大概減少1. 7億,那這邊就是剛才提到的那個應付股利的部分有1. 7億,那每股淨值的部分是35. 4元。 我們看下一頁,這是我們歷年來的EPS跟股利的一個發放,那我們看一下,去年整體的2024年我們的EPS是0. 84元,那我們預計發放的股利是1塊錢,接下來針對業務面的部分我們請各位投資界朋友大家午安,我想針對我們展望比較關心的應該都是在我們的AI的還有機器人相關的業務,所以我今天也比較針對這部分來做說明,那首先我先講一下整個在我們這個AI機器人的部分不包括我們代理的這部分我們現在大概全球已經有超過500家的客戶。 這500家的客戶大概也有差不多三分之一是已經有重購就是repeat customer,那這個跨的行業也蠻多的,我這邊分兩頁來做說明,這第一頁是針對我們的3D機器人視覺這一部分,那這部分可以看到從半導體的設備啊半導體的這個FAB 晶圓廠 Logistics各行各業,這行業非常的多,那在應用也有非常多不同的應用從3D的亂堆取料啊拆舵啊到有些像鞋子的打磨啊,這個汽車的塗膠噴膠等等各式各樣的會用到機器人3D視覺的應用都有。 那而且他這個客戶也是分佈在全球,例如說在半導體設備這邊我們就有美系跟這個歐系的半導體設備作為我們的大客戶,在下一頁,那另外一塊是跟機器人比較不相關的例如說像檢測,檢測這邊呢其實是我們更大宗的一個生意來源,那這包括瑕疵的檢測啊counting的技術啊OC啊掃碼等等很多的不同的應用包括像我們把AI跟AR眼鏡又結合在一起的一些SOP的validation等等。 那這邊用的行業又更多了因為各行各業都需要檢測,那這邊從從例如說像這個像一些精品業像Chanel到半導體到農產品各行各業都有,所以這部分也是大家現在比較關注我們都是在ROBA這邊其實在非ROBA這邊這塊隊伍開始會提供這個Full solution,那其實最近我們有跟那個回答跟NVIDIA跟音業達共同有公布一個Solution,這個三家公司都有發布這個新聞稿。

This is one of the solutions to this video, which is used in the SERVER AI SERVER flaw checking above, which actually combines ROBA and the fault detection in the application of this Motion Planning path control for Heda with all our own AI flaw detection, what would be the difference in the past may be a flaw detection software we can only sell to $12 million, that through such a solution, for example, we sell to NVIDIA also sell to the U.S. companies also sold to the U.S. invisible braces, that can do this in a way that can be more than one million or more dollars. So we hope that by providing such a solution can increase our average price, this is not only the solution, the second is long-term but now does, is Jensen, this is not only this time from CES to Computex, and this concept is in fact that we have been in the future that we have to do this kind of the agent.

I think we have many clients already proven that our AI, when doing visual recognition, the amount of learning required is much less than the needs of our peers, and we are a big strength. That is, if you are an agent, if you are looking for someone to help you do things, agent, you don't want an agent to learn things slowly, so you will be less efficient, OK. On the top right side of that is that you want this Oba to not only need his hands, then the top right corner is to say, how your hands and feet can be precise, efficient.

So, we have to be able to connect with a lot of different robots, such as traditional robot arms, human robots, robot dogs, this AMR, drones, and so on. So, for the past seven years, in this AI, is to put a variety of robots and a variety of AI such neural networks, Motion these strings together, on one platform. That's what this would look like, if every engineer so concatenate, it's really a good time, so we built a platform, next page, this is a variety of hardware, we have to concatenate it, and then next page.

Manager, I would like to ask, because your first quarter gross profit margin YY is a recession, you can not tell the reason, then the second is that there are the gross profit margin of each product line, then there are 25 and 26 years of each product line is what is the gross profit margin, now look, thank you.

這個毛利率整體毛利率,這個Jack你講一下,但是這個針對各產品呢,我們不去做這個break down。 第一季那個毛利率有衰退,有幾個就是第一個我們那個產品組合因為我們整個營收整個,那個營收有增加嘛,有一些產品組合的一些那個組合不太一樣,那再來就是我們有部分的一個案件的工程,其實在接待的時候毛利是有當初接待毛利是有比較低的,那在這一季有認列出來,那就會身體的毛利率是有,有往下下一點點。 我補充一下他剛講的這個案件是指這個發電機那邊的案件,然後還有在我們在代理這個ROCKWELL,就是我們的自動化這邊的產品的那邊那部分有些毛利率的下滑,好的。 那我們還有沒有其他的媒體朋友或投資先進想要舉手發問的呢,我們後面,管理層好想請教一下就是我們能不能就是提一下我們今年整體的業務,然後業務的展望以及我們未來的一個發展方向,就是今年,我們會做怎樣的調整嗎,當然現在的環境的因素變動的很大嘛,有這個貿易戰,匯率等等的,所以這個也很難這邊再做forecast,不過就我們目前看到的,以去年我們看,像這個公控這一塊,公控是指像我們在代理ROCKWELL這一塊,去年其實我們去年每個單位都不好,今年看起來最起碼在第一季都有比較好轉,不管是發電機還有這個公控,那當然在現在這邊,一定也是有一個比較大的一個成長,所以,看起來目前為止,目前為止還算正向,那後面會不會受到什麼環境因素,這我不敢,不敢在這邊亂預估。 好的,那麼現場還有沒有投資先進或媒體朋友想要發問的呢,關於索羅門想要了解更多未來AI或機器人相關的趨勢發展的問題想要提出的,那我們這邊我們前面有先收集業題目想要來請教一下,那麼今年因為剛才其實有提到公控的部分表現的還不錯嘛,那目前以這個roadmap來講是不是其實最先發酵的可能還是在剛剛說到的工業用的部分喔,那,也可以聊一下說我們目前看可能這是像是機器狗乃至於到人形的機器人這一部分,就是AI物理AI這一部分喔,大概要到什麼時候才可以真正比較看得到一些數字上面的一些feedback呢,公控其實是還蠻傳統的一個產業我們在講就是像POC變頻器,所以這個都是老行業了,所以這個,我們在這塊是代理,那,實際您剛提到的所謂的機器人機器狗,這個都還好,在很初期,所以現在其實的AI的運用比較大量的,都還是在一般的這個機械手臂還有像瑕疵檢測這類的應用上面,至於,您剛問到說人形機器人跟機械狗這個到,要到什麼時間點才會有大量,這可能還需要一點,一些時間因為就我們自己現在在看很多這些硬體呢,還有蠻多的空間需要在,在進步的。 所以目前看起來會比較需要進步的是剛才說到的,物理上面的限制就是說可能是在機器人他的關節呀或者是一些反而還是說KillerApp他的一些就是,殺手級的應用,這個部分或者說人家真的目前看到需求這一塊,這個地方跟剛剛說到的可能是硬體的應用,可能是硬體上面物理上面的限制可能哪一個影響會比較大一點,現在應該這樣講,如果我們說把這個人形機器人軟體跟就AI的腦的部分跟手跟腳的部分來做一個區隔的話,其實現在的軟的部分是跑得比較快,進步的比較快,但在機械上面的機構上面比如說我們到我們的攤位去看,那台人形機器人,他的沒走一步的誤差,就好幾公分了,他累積起來這樣的誤差有多少,那他的手呢,不管是速度呢精度呢,靈巧度呢,都還是沒有辦法跟傳統的機械手臂這樣在做比較,所以其實你說,剛回答剛您,跟之前那個問題這個要到什麼時候才能,大量的被使用,我想最起碼這些,這些關鍵的這些要素能要能夠讓大家可以感覺起來,用起來比較放心一點。

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Today, we welcome the chairman of the board of directors to come to the scene to ask some questions about the robot and AI development of the future, to ask the management team, the current part of our operating expenses will be for the next quarter will be maintained in Q1 this level, and then say that this year in the business cost section we will mainly spend on where, will increase, may also increase in a small increase because we are still human or RD human resources or continue to grow, marketing should be relatively small, marketing will be about the same, marketing will not be greatly increased, human resources may be, and then will increase some, thank you.

This is the first time that we have seen our business growth in the first quarter of the year, which is a quarter of our revenue growth in the first quarter of the year. This is a quarter of our revenue growth, compared to the quarter of our revenue growth in the first quarter of the year. This is a quarter of our revenue growth in 2025 Q1, a quarter of our revenue growth in Q11%.

This growth is derived from the data center here on the whole of the light of a jump wire and the demand for photovoltaic components increased, then in the business gross profit, our DQ business gross profit is 7 million, compared to the previous quarter 112% growth, which compared to the last quarter of last year there will be 233% growth, that gross profit margin, business gross profit, the first quarter has reached 17%, compared to the previous quarter in comparison to the previous quarter, compared to the first quarter of the year we have increased 9%. This part of the operating fee, the current first quarter is 77 million, compared to the fourth quarter has slightly growth, which is probably increased by 10 million, the same as the last year of the year DQ increase in this area, we need to explain that because there is still a deep technical layout in this area, so here, for our personnel, and for our RD, some technical development of research materials and some high-level R&D equipment investment, so that there is a trend trend is a trend of growth.

The whole coupled with our real estate and plant equipment, you can also see that we have been increasing in real estate and equipment and plant here, mainly because we began to have some automation equipment related to the components of the organs, so on March 31st, we reached 5.63 million, the total assets to March end of our total assets is 30.63 million, the liability part is 5.41 million, the shareholders interest part is 25.23 million 80%. Looking at the financial structure of our financial structure is relatively healthy and a very good financial structure, there is a benefit to the future development.

The EURO part is 100% growth, so we have a great growth here in the United States, Asia, China and Europe over the years. Next, let's talk about what we've developed over the years, what we've done, and some very important layouts with some Majestone. The main part is that we're working on three directions in this process of developing this CPU, the first is the AWARD part, the second is the part of technology, and the third is the equipment that we've been improving our automation.

In this part of the equipment, from Cable Assembling to NPO Assembling, to last year's LPO test line, the company's development is building a mass production line, and this supplier with the equipment for the future mass production of the equipment in some specifications. Well, next, we will talk to you in two directions to explain our performance, the first is the current product, and the second is the silicon light future development of the product. The current part of the product, our use of jump and light line in the data center is mainly based on the current large data center is a backbone professional structure.

The first part of the application will go from CPU with XPU to the CPU with switch to the CPU with XPU in one direction. We have been following this step of our customers to improve the development of our product. Then the most concerned is the development of this advanced technology, how do we do a layout. At present, we are in three directions, the first phase is LP, the first phase is LPO, and the first part is 1. 6T, then we have set up a production line in the fourth quarter of last year. That year's 4Q will do a mass production of a product, and then also provide a back-end system factory to do a system authentication.

This year's 4Q, due to the construction of this program, this year's 4Q to next year's 4Q, will build our production line, which is also expected to provide this product in the 3Q next year to provide this mass production verification and system factory to do system verification. In comparison to some high-bandwidth FAU of this part of this layout, we are currently carrying 3. 2T of this product, and now also doing product verification, which 4. 6. 4T is the 2Dimension's refarcam fiber array units, we are also in the design verification. The more important technology is the RMT to MMC cable, the RMT to MMC cable part is mainly a connector will be placed in the fiber array units.

And then our second field is an important field in the optical packaging of this technology, that is, the optical packaging technology is mainly to be the FAU precisely packaged in the PIC, our COOPER has a division of PIC and PIC, so to do a precise docking of this package. The other part is the 3 part, because the fiber array is very small, he is placed directly in this PIC, so the PIC to the middle of the system board need to be connected to the light, so we also in this 3 part of the design, a design is the RMT connector to the E Fiber array of RMT connector, the other connector is the MMC of this connector with our cable to do the connection.

So the 2D part is right, because our Fiber Array Unit is very small and very small, so its space is limited, so when your light is in line, it will have a light flux, a light flux limit. We are going to go in the direction of 2D, so the current development of this part of the Fiber Array Unit is greater than 6. 4T. So just look at this one, the next part of the LPU, the next part of the LPU, this 6T is the one on the right, is the one on the other side of the CPU, is the difference is where we can look at this part of the LMC.

所以他其實是把這個Fiber Array Unit跟光線跟NMC的接頭整個就是放在PCB板上面跟Coop去做對接,所以他現在還是一個插拔式的方式。 那CPU的部分呢,他就會這個光線,這邊比較長的這個光線,整個就會縮短變得非常的短,那非常的短,他就會直接就是跟我們的Lens的部分跟我們的光線跟我們的Connect,RMT的Connect就直接對接在這個裡頭。 所以其實他的發展其實有一點點不太一樣,從LPU我們可以看得到他提升了,實際還有一個PCB板跟一個Plugable的一個存在,那等他到CPU的部分他整個的PCB板跟Plugable的部分就會完全的就會變成是一個,這邊就不會存在,就會完全就會組裝到PIC裡頭去了。 因為去年11月法說的時候公司說,不會發展LPU,我們目前確實是LPU確實不是我們的主力,但是LPU的LPU是在CPU過程中的一個發展,那配合客戶的需要我們現在很多資源主要還是放在CPU,但是配合客戶的需求我們在LPU這邊也是做開發跟配合,所以我意思是LPU是有客戶的嗎,還是只是目前是配合客戶的需要。 好的,剛剛後面有一位要發問嗎,不用,好的,那我們現場還有沒有想要來提問的部分的話呢,後面喔,接受我的提問,剛才那個第一季的資本支出,支出是9000萬,可是我記得,那個去年跟期情虱目的,好像512嘛,對5. 221,然後有講說他的,他要準備是第一季第二季第三季好像是各1億7,1億7,1億8的樣子,對,現在只花了9000萬。 因為他目前有一些是在我們的working capital,因為我們現在的營收,也成長,所以我們在working capital的這邊需求也變多,所以我們當初在做這個虱目的時候,其實有包含working capital的一個成長的這個預期在裡面,所以今年那個5. 2億是今年是一定會把它花光嗎,今年會,會花掉,對,那另外一個就是可不可以到那個,也是剛才那一頁,下一頁好了,再下一頁好了,這一頁嗎,因為現在業界都一直在講說可擦把的FAU,我想要釐清一下所謂可擦把是不是第三個那個部分,應該是說現在的可擦把的部分是,以這一種的形式存在,就是比較像是第一個的這個方式,他是一個擦拔式的,方式存在,那應該是說你要問的應該是有包含可擦拔式跟detachable的部分, 可擦拔式的比較像我們以前的這個transceiver的部分。

This application is just to say that we have a lot of light source on the PCB board before transceiver, and now this plugable part will go to the is, his light fluorescent components will be integrated into the OIC this chip, and then to the COOPER here will do the docking, so we in this plugable this part, will not see all the light fluorescent components like the previous PCB is placed on the PCB board, the other part you talk about should be detachable, detachable part is he is, he has not with us to this FAU, put it in this PIC when there is no assembly precise way, he is anattachable way, so he can do one.

拔起來放上去的一個,如果說他有damage的時候你可以把他拔起來再放一個上去,那assembling的方式是不太一樣的,assembling的方式是指說我在這個製程的過程中我們已經把FAU直接封裝在這個PIC裡頭了,那上層的設計有一點點不太一樣的地方就是我們是分兩段的,我們這一段為了要確保就是光的精準度就是偶光的這個精準度跟使用性未來的使用性,所以我們在做FAU的這一塊是很精準的,就是封裝到這個PIC裡頭,但是在後端的這個部分,就是我們在講這個3的這個部分,我們把3跟1的這個部分變成是detachable的,他是用對差的方式,也就是說我們把後面的光纖傳輸的這個部分去做這個detachable的方式,那1的這個部分呢,我們是直接做這個精準的封裝就直接assembling到PIC裡頭,這個是固定在上面,對,就是固定在裡面。 那個NVIDIA在那個GTC發表的那個CPO switch,他是,是你講的那個,那個方式,發展的這個CPO的這個switch,我這邊可能比較方便幫這個全球的這個最大的leading company去做一些發言,那我這邊比較針對就是我們上全這邊在跟這些國際型的客戶開發的時候我們能夠做什麼,我們要提供什麼,所以這個部分在請這個投資先進這邊,多多多多,提亮。 好的,我們後面還有一位想要發問的,我想請教一下那個LPO跟CPO,從cost或良率的角度上面來看的話,就是客人願意先選LPO不是直接走到CPO這個主要的關鍵是什麼,就是說,我相信有year的會是一個關鍵,然後price,cost也是一個關鍵,那在這方面,你能跟我們分享一下,因為我剛剛看兩個solution都是1. 6T,但是為什麼1. 6T會有兩個solution,然後,就是客人在這方面的選擇是什麼,就是說,我是想確認一下,就是說這個LPO是不是有可能過度的時間會比我們想像中來得久,因為我看中間大概有至少一年的落差。 LPO的部分,因為他是plugable的一個方式,所以他是Lens會放到這個Pic裡頭中間是光線後面是接連接,連接頭,Connector,那他的設計的複雜度會比CO的設計的複雜度會簡單許多,那CPO他是一個比較weaver level的一個設計的一個模式,那LPO另外一個不同的地方是LPO是單顆的,他是一顆一顆的,那CPO他在做整合的時候,他是一個package的方式,就是直接封裝到整個的Switch版或者XPU的這個整個subtrade上面跟Coop,然後他就在這邊去做對接,所以在技術難度上,雖然我們看起來是都是1. 6T,但是從發展的過程中CPO會從1. 6T一直走到3. 2T到走到6. 4T到甚至更高的頻寬,那他會就更高的頻寬都是base on就是weaver level的一個半導體的一個要求去做設計跟開發。 也就是說從發展上面來看,走到未來的AI跟high performance community,computing,如果這個的產品能夠發展,走到這個量產驗證跟系統驗證也能夠去評級,那對未來的整個AI的發展跟high performance computing在做這個光對聯的時候就會有很大的一個效能跟整個的一個成長的一個空間,那從成本,因為你剛剛也問到成本的問題,那成本的部分確實是CPO的部分會比LPO,因為他比較複雜,所以他確實是他的價值的value會比LPO,LPO還要來得高,一個range,因為我覺得就是說switch廠商的採用其實還是講本球率,我如果一樣是1. 6T就像你開高速公路,我,時速500公里,我,就是,假設我200萬車子跟500萬車子當然都可以開時速500公里,我的意思是說,cost方面,假設LPO是1的話,那CPO大概現在要跳到多少,假設在1. 6T這個level,cost的部分,我們如果是從1. 6T來看,感覺上大家會覺得好像1. 6T的LPO是比較具有經濟效益,但是如果當我們的AI跟high performance的頻寬的要求變得很大的時候,我們如果說是採用1. 6T plugable的方式或CPO的1. 6T的方式,那就是在我們的switch的IC的周邊或者是XPU的周邊要放非常多的couple跟非常多的fiber array unit,那也就是說他整個的系統版跟他整個的規劃都會變得比較大,所以對整個效能的運用跟發展上面就會有一些瓶頸。 所以從未來的這個角度發展來看,我們如果去看一些市場的一些leading company,他接市的一些switch的一個頻寬的這個發展,他會從目前的51. 2T到110,102. 4T然後再一直往上跑,那當他一直往上跑的時候,如果你只用1. 6T的這個方案他的整個成本的增加幅度就會變得非常的大,那他在效能跟他的latency的這個部分就會面臨比較大的一個能耗的這個問題,那這個也是我們現在一直在為什麼要發展這個CPO,一直往高頻寬的方向去發展最主要就是要解決,就是資料傳輸的latency跟energy consumption跟未來的資料傳輸速度的一個,能夠滿足AI跟high performance computing,所以從短期來看你會覺得好像1. 6T的pluggable他具有優勢,但是如果從長期的發展來看還是要找一個比較長久的一個solution的一個解決的方案。

Ok, there is any investment advanced want to ask, because of the relationship of time, we may only accept the last question, this is rare, the last question, such as how we are with Taki electric current relationship is, Taki electric, sorry, because I am not, we do not publish this performance, we do not target a specific customer or a specific supplier to do a statement, that we are more from the company's point of view, we can provide a whole direction for investors to reference, okay, so today we first thank the chief financial officer, a warm applause, that we have before today.

Thank you very much for your participation today. Today, in fact, we have completed 25 successful events on this Taiwan Smart Technology Island. Thank you very much for your participation whether it is on-site or online. Thank you very much for your next visit.
