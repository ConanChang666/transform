The first is the Chairman of St. Paulâ€™s, and the Vice President of Chen Shih-Ming and Wang Jing-Chyi. The interview will be divided into two parts. In the process of the presentation, if you have any questions, please fill in your questions on the question form, and we will collect them after the presentation, and the company will reply to you unifiedly.

Thank you for attending the legal briefing in the afternoon. Today is mainly a report of the results of our operations in 2024. I will introduce the operating part of the company first, and then ask our Financial Secretary to report the financial part.

First, let's report on the major results of last year's 2024. In 2024, we increased our revenue by more than 35% year-on-year, with a proposed increase of 31.5%. In part of the CDMO revenue increased by 32.3% year-on-year, and in part of the global drug sales performance by 84. 0%.

In addition, after the CDMO, we have actually completed a one-stop service, including from drug research and development, trial and production, then we can have logistics, and then we can sell the whole block. In addition, we have acquired another piece of the puzzle, which is the preparation plant. We have been looking forward to the acquisition of a production plant, aseptic aseptic aseptic aseptic. So we entered the injection plant after the acquisition last year.

The other two new products were successfully listed in the U.S. and were the market leader. Including our acquisition of Vigafine from Pyrox, as well as our own development of Protection Chloride in the U.S.A. were successfully listed and dominated. We all know that Decidental Parasol's academic name is in the U.S., and we are currently a market leader in the face of positive competition.

In fact, in this place, we also have its combined benefits, that is, our current production can increase our sales, that our sales can also increase our production. This is one of the results above the acid engine. In the past decade we have acquired these cases, we have made a hope that these plants have one effect, such as 1 plus 1 greater than 2, so we will proceed the steps, like the first one we will do after the merger.

This is not a C-Diablo. The first thing we do after the merger is to do a business improvement, which means that it has never been a foundry to be an foundry business. Then we will integrate the integration. The integration includes the integration between each plant, we will develop from the integration of hardware and software, the integration of personnel, and the integration of equipment, so that the cost can be reduced and the operating efficiency will increase. Then we will do the Grammy integration, and then we will expand and upgrade with a single mod. So we will make some investments in these newly acquired plants each year.

So we will also have budgets this year, and there are also in our Maple Grove plant in Minnesota, where we will invest capital expenditures. These advantages we have in CdMO, in fact, we have some of the technologies that cross-tech and cross-model platforms, because our plant has a variety of productions, including we have oral solid models, then nasal sprays, eye drops, semi-solid models, and liquid models. So we have also compiled injection machines in last year, and then there are biologics in this respect, we can do that.

Thank you. The performance of some of the performances in the other series, we divided it into three parts to give you a explanation. The first on production performance, last year we had a total production of about 2.8 billion doses, all of which have been approved by some international return units, like the USFDA they will be regular to see production, and the European EMA and PMDA Japan, which have passed.

This is actually done in a very efficient way. Another constant commission effect in production is that we have 32% of our current product revenue from the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world. Then we have to mention the three major changes that we have just mentioned in 2024, building our very good foundation in the United States. The first is the Oxford Smith plant in Minnesota, which we ordered, and the Oxford Smith plant in Minnesota should be the largest small molecule plant, which can actually reach 3.5 billion units of production capacity, and we have a logistics center in it, so we can distribute it ourselves.

The sterile manufacturing plant that we bought at the time, in fact, the production capacity was very high, so this year there will be plans to do some expansion and upgrade. He also has some OEMs at the time of connection, and then we have a new product, we have signed nine cooperation agreements, and then brought in 20 new products for production.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and convert it into paragraph-based transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed in any sentence, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how these transcriptions are rationally combined into a coherent paragraph.

First of all, I read through the entire transcript to understand the overall content and structure. It looks like this section mainly involves business development, mergers and acquisitions, technology platforms, sales strategies, and financial reporting. Next, I need to identify the topic of each paragraph and classify the relevant sentence together. For example, the parts of the merger may include multiple sentences, which need to be organized consistently. It is important to note that some sentences may have timestamp intervals, but users request not to delete anything, so all timestamps must be kept. At the same time, make sure the transition between paragraphs are natural and logically clear.

For example, sentences about the macromolecular CMF service should be placed in the same paragraph, followed by the capacity increase after the addition of the Tefal, and then the completion of the three main mission sections. During the processing process, there may be some challenges, such as how to deal with duplicate or similar content, or how to group technical terms correctly. For example, a description of ADC technology needs to be coupled with dual-specific, three-specific antibodies to maintain the consistency of the technical discussion.

In addition, the financial part requires a separate segmentation to ensure the accurate presentation of the data. It is also necessary to pay attention to the connection between the sentences and the logical relationship to ensure that the paragraphs are smooth. For example, use the "because", "so" and other links to maintain a clear causal relationship. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences or timestamps to ensure that all the contents are correctly included. Finally, after finishing the initial draft, I will read the entire paragraph typed transcript again to confirm that there are no omissions of the original sentences, and that the paragraph structure is reasonable, in line with the user's requirements.

After this treatment, we should be able to meet the needs of users, provide a clear, connected paragraph type transcript. </think> [paragraph transcription]: The main purpose is to allow the big molecules to have a warrior with a CMF service, because we have a strong R&D energy, we have a production plant in the United States, and he has this mass production experience, so we can provide a very good solution to customers. So these three transformational targets last year we have achieved very quickly, is from a small molecule chain production, and then there are big molecules in the last year to complete these three major missions, this is really what we want to do.

In addition, in the part of the sale, we acquired upshot Smith last year, we know that upshot Smith was actually founded in 1919, it is probably a textbook-grade pharmaceutical factory in the United States, in fact, it is actually a textbook-grade pharmaceutical factory, it is very well-known in the U.S. channel business, that is also very stable, so we are currently the TWI some of the U.S.'s product channels are merged into the Upshot Smith, so the sales part is carried out by Upshot Smith this channel, which can improve our market strategy and operational efficiency, and can also expand our brand awareness, which is a good one Synergy in the sale. We know that the DLS is used to ulcer the drug, we are the DLS is used to ulcer the drug, that is, we are the first to be listed as a dummy drug, then we know that there is also a fierce market competition, but we still maintain a 40% muggy Shearer, this is a very good drug, that is, we have to do a very good product, in fact, TWI also have this drug, that Oxygen Smith also, we will be together, so at the moment it has three different physical equivalents and doses of the drug, so we should be the highest in the market occupation, we should be in the United States, that we statistics about the DLS performance in the same industry, we can reach an average of 49%, then we can reach 64 1%, our gross price or better than the commodity. The company has a strong track record of developing new products in the U.S.A., and we have a strong track record of producing new products in the U.S.A., and we have a strong track record of developing new products in the U.S.A., and we have a strong track record of developing new products in the U.S.A.A., and a strong track record of developing new products in the U.S.A.A., and a strong track record of developing new products in the U.S.A.A.A., and a strong track record of developing new products in the U.A.A.A.A.A.A.A., and a strong track record in the U.A.E.A.A.A.A.E.E.A.A.A.E.

It was 2022 when we merged into Ancheng. Maori fell to 27.8. We were in the port of the year. That was a decision. We ended up selling some low Maori products. In 2023, Maori would be up to 49%.

That's 2024 this year. It's because it's powered by our Marathi booster plant. There are two months of quality improvements to shutdown. And Action Smith. We evaluated his stockpiles. We made some behind-the-scenes experiences.

So the gross profit margin is slightly lower to 40%. After that, it was restored. In fact, the gross profit margin of 2024 was 42.8. That was our acquisition. In fact, buying a company is a package of products.

We did it when we bought it in 2022. Now 2024, 2025. We are doing it at the same time. Put some low gross profit products. Replace manufacturing to make some adjustments. So there are some changes to the gross profit margin as a whole.

That's part of the growth of our revenue stream. In 2023, our revenue was 1.4 billion. That's the organic girls of the West Radio. More than 500 million. Commercial. Because of Waste to the extinguishing drug.

His competitors came in. The revenue was 2.5 billion. Our combined Oxygen Smith. The revenue was 6.2 billion. The revenue was 92.28 billion. Pure's is a seafood-specific medicine.

Because there is only one month. So it brings more than 18000 million revenue contributions. The rest is gray. There are more than 50 million other incomes. The part of this flush is that we have mutual synergy within our group.

That's why the entire merger is a revenue of 192 billion. That's the proportion of radio waves in the West. 33% of commercial sales are 67%. That's the part that needs to be seen. 2023.

Because we merged in 2022, we didn't make a lot of investments in 2023. The main selling of DLS drugs was zero-to-zero. So gross profit was 49% higher. That was in 2024.

But because of these economics, the profit of the electro-optical eye is good. We also produced from outside the industry. The profit of the sellers. So we also paid billions of dollars for the sellers. In 2024, we acquired through the United States.

Maori has some marketing. Because some products have a slightly lower Maori. So Maori is 40%. That's part of the sales pipeline. We have a one-time acquisition fee of 600 million. That's the acquisition fee of these three lands.

The M&A costs include: attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, financial advisers' fees. There are also original TSAs sold to us. That's the cost of technology platform use. There are 6 billion dollars spent here. And there are 4 billion other parts that are rare diseases.

There is also about 300 million interest. Whether the acquisition proceeds from the funds. So the whole. Outside the industry, we also have a 1.7 billion cheap purchase benefits.

That's why we buy cheaply for good. We buy better at a relatively low price. But some of them are in fact, some of them are in store, some of them are in revenue, some of them are in store, some of them are in revenue. They are in fact, some of them are in store, some of them are in store, and some of them are in revenue.

This is the product we acquired from Purex in November 2020. It is a product that is effective and convenient, and it is a revolutionary product that has been on the VicTron market for nearly fifty years. It can mention safety and accuracy, as it is easy to memorize and there is no uncertainty in the mixture of powders.

If this approval is granted, there is an exclusive seven-year probation period. That is also an application for TSC preparation. This is now in Comercial's team and will focus on building a leadership position in the children's health-related disease market. We have acquired Oxygen Meats, which has VicTron, a brand of medicine, and then it has its special channels with the team responsible for the Wizard's sales, as well as the pharmacy channel.

The potential market is around $2.29 per kilogram. At present, the market performance of new patients is in line with what we expect. We will continue to switch old patients to our new products. That is, now our R&D pipeline will be concentrated in this field.

The ROE has reached 30 percent, and the ROIC has 23%. With the acquisition, our working capital has been enhanced. That's because we're still looking at mergers and acquisitions, so now we've got more than 58 billion dollars in cash. That's because we've released an ECB for the upgrade industry last year.

That's why in 2020, we reached 75% of GSK Debt to Equity's Ratio. That 202.115 was a fast drop to 31%. In 2022, we reached 70% of the E-Dent Debt to Equity. That's because our debt is higher than ours, so in 2023, we're all focused on pulling DLS back a few times, so we can see that this ratio is down to 9.1%, which is quite low and should be the lowest in history.

That 2024 also made some capital market funds, and we will transfer the operation of the subsidiary back to the loan. Then CP3 is also in the process of conversion. In addition, we have also made a lot of land real estate plants in the acquisition process, some idle parts, and a good chance that we will want to make some more fire, so that the debt can be reduced. After the 2025 benefits gradually emerged, the whole should be a quality change, and the operation will bring a new wave of growth. I think that 2025 should be our goal set a year of harvest, because a lot of what we put in 2024, which is now being actively adjusted. In terms of the business of CDMO, since we are gradually reduced, Maple Grove expect it to introduce external customers in March and upgrade.

The structure of the production line will be more and more optimized. The Marlin Aseptic Steam Plant has an automation, and we expect it to go live in the third quarter of this year, and it will be more productive, then it will be more productive, and the unit cost will be reduced very quickly. That 2025 we have added 20 new CDMO customers to the current CDMO. The commercial part is that the gross interest rate of the children's rare disease specialty, because it is more powerful because it is a rare disease market, and its gross interest rate is very high.

We have moved the whole group to the direction of rare disease drugs, and the sale of generic drugs will be obtained in a licensed manner. That is why in 2024 we will want to expand this scale and then be able to use the existing mergers and acquisitions to achieve better integration and capital acquisition. This page is about the ESG of Breiter, the sustainable development of Breiter.

Our ESG, we have a Sustainability Committee, where more than half of our independent directors are independent directors, and we have five working groups, represented by first-level managers. In addition to our current ESG practices, we do not need to do a sustainability report, so now we want to be able to land in every plant. Because our clients, like GSK himself, have a commitment to SBTI, then our manufacturers at home will do SBTI to cope.

Our subsidiary, Axie Smith, also has some drug-sponsored programs from Patient and Pharmacy Clinic Spansion Pharma, which are part of ESG. Here we mention that our Board of Directors will also establish a press committee on the results of our Board of Directors, and then conduct due diligence on employee human rights, which also declares that we will be competing by 2050. The SBTI is a major manufacturer of the home, and he has a commitment because his main client GSK has the same commitment, so we will move towards that goal.

Here are some of the efforts we have made in the sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain. Here are some of the highlights of the award presented to us by Borla, which is the best corporate employer award we have received in 2019 and in 2024. The rapid growth of the fast-growing 100K magazine, we have received many awards from the merger and acquisition association, which was the President Tsai Ing-wen, who gave us the President's Innovation Award last year, which is some of the awards we have received.

This is the part of the CDMO. The part of Commerce is that we expand the influence of the global market and then strengthen the market for new products that maintain special drugs and academic drugs, which also ensures that the assets we acquire can be effectively integrated, because there are TWI, AxiosMix, Puris, and here we are in a channel and product integration. The positive assessment of the part of Commerceo, above is in the presentation, thank you everyone, that this is the stage of the package to this paragraph, so please give me a little hand to ask questions, so that our staff can collect, thank you.

If you are looking for a solution that can help you achieve your goals, you will be able to achieve your goals. If you are looking for a solution that will help you achieve your goals, you will be able to achieve your goals.

If you are looking for a solution that will help you achieve your goals.

The second issue is the strategy of Trump drug tariffs in the United States. The third issue is the intention of distributing stock incentives this year. The purpose of this year's distribution is that we believe that our industry can grow, or we can distribute shares after EPS, so we have the confidence to distribute the stock to encourage, so I answer the tariff question, because the tariff problem is also everyone can also focus, in fact, we have a solution, like we also have to share with the operator, because we have a pharmaceutical company in the United States, so if our customers think that we want to produce in Asia or Canada, he thinks that I have a plan for him, or I can even provide some assistance to some of them in the United States, as well as in Taiwan has some of these problems. Another question is that the customer still considers the cost of production in the United States, in Japan and in Canada, his differences will be greater than 25% if not.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided to see how to make a reasonable segmentation while keeping the timestamp correctly mapped.

First of all, I will examine the corresponding sentences for each timestamp in a sentence to determine which sentences can be logically combined into paragraphs. For example, a portion of the impact of tariffs may require a merger, while questions and answers about capital expenditures may require a separate segment. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure that the timeframe of each paragraph is correct. Next, I will deal with professional terms such as "CDMO" and "USL" mentioned by the user to ensure that it does not change its meaning during the conversion process.

In addition, the financial data mentioned by the user, such as tax rates, operating expenses, etc., need to be accurately retained and cannot be changed. For the question and answer section, it is necessary to maintain the structure of the question and answer, but it may be necessary to merge multiple parts of the same question into a more coherent paragraph. During the processing process, I need to pay special attention to whether the format of the timestamp is correct, such as [2368. 90-2372. 90].

In addition, the user-provided verbatim has some gaps between the verbs, such as [2635. 90-2642. 90] after [2639. 90-2642. 90], which is missing in the middle of [2637. 90], which may be a typographical error, but the user does not point out, so keep it as it should. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of the punctuation and sentences, to ensure that the converted paragraphs read naturally and smoothly. Finally, I will read the paragraph verbatim texts of the whole conversion, check that everything has been converted correctly, with no omissions or errors. Make sure that the corresponding sentences of each timestamp are correctly placed in the correct paragraph, and the overall structure meets the user's requirements. After these steps, make a comprehensive check again to ensure that all instructions are met.

[2368. 90-2372. 90] Because you have moved it may not be necessary to do so. [2372. 90-2374. 90] Of course, there will be comparisons. [2374. 90-2376. 90] CDMO at the beginning. [2376. 90-2378. 90] This is a good phenomenon for us. [2378. 90-2380. 90] That is because it is a new product. [2380. 90-2382. 90] Its gross profit is high.

[2382. 90-2385. 90] It doesn't need to be too much of a risk. [2385. 90-2387. 90] Because the current Trump tariff problem is very high. [2387. 90-2389. 90] So you don't know how it will change. [2389. 90-2393. 90] So it may be a priority for us to have a factory in the United States. [2392. 90-2393. 90] This is also a lot for us. [2394. 90-2393. 90] This I want to see if you are the closest to it.

[2397. 90-2400. 90] Some analysts in India are also talking about this. [2400. 90-2402. 90] It is not a good choice for them. [2402. 90-2407. 90] However, for CDMO, they may not have an advantage in the United States. [2407. 90-2411. 90] I think this is good for Paulie. [2411. 90-2415. 90] I think it seems to be more positive in this regard. [2415. 90-2417. 90] I'll add that.

[2417. 90-2420. 90] This tariff is partly divided into two phases. [2420. 90-2422. 90] One is CDMO. [2422. 90-2426. 90] CDMO is basically working for our clients. [2426. 90-2429. 90] In fact, we sold him the same price. [2429. 90-2433. 90] That's basically what we think our clients are going to raise in the US. [2433. 90-2438. 90] So the US inflation of drugs should be seen.

[2438. 90-2440. 90] That's what they're going to raise. [2440. 90-2443. 90] So that's not a big influence on the CDMO. [2443. 90-2445. 90] That's the end of the drug sale. [2445. 90-2448. 90] This is the part of the USL and TWI. [2448. 90-2450. 90] Our general drug is made in the US. [2450. 90-2452. 90] So that's not a big influence on the CDMO.

[2452. 90-2475. 90] That raw material we ask our suppliers to reduce or match. [2457. 90-2460. 90] That relative to some of our medicines is made in Taiwan. [2460. 90-2463. 90] This actually includes some of the DLLS made in Taiwan. [2463. 90-2465. 90] We are all optimizing the manufacturing part of it. [2465. 90-2467. 90] So we are reducing its costs. [2467. 90-2469. 90] So we are doing this plan.

[2469. 90-2473. 90] We have also taken a lot of medicines to Taiwan. [2473. 90-2474. 90] We have moved to Taiwan. [2475. 90-2478. 90] Regardless of whether the tariff is 10% or 20%. [2478. 90-2481. 90] In fact, the cost of moving to Taiwan is very much reduced. [2481. 90-2484. 90] So it still has its advantages. [2484. 90-2486. 90]

[2486. 90-2488. 90] actually increases our production capacity. [2488. 90-2490. 90] increases our production capacity. [2490. 90-2493. 90] actually lowers the cost of all these products. [2493. 90-2495. 90] So we just started. [2495. 90-2497. 90] Mr. Trump seems to have announced in February. [2497. 90-2499. 90] Or the end of January.

[2499. 90-2501. 90] The end of January was announced. [2501. 90-2503. 90] We were very quick to announce this kind of tax. [2503. 90-2505. 90] Do an internal analysis. [2505. 90-2507. 90] After the internal analysis. [2507 90-2509. 90] We actually feel that they are present. [2509. 90-2511. 90] Trump is the tax.

[2511. 90-2512. 90] has influence on us. [2512. 90-2514. 90] is not very much about the gross profit of the product influence. [2514. 90-2518. 90] is actually some of our current. [2518. 90-2521. 90] has been made in North America or the United States in the past two years. [2521. 90-2524. 90] The production base of this investment. [2524. 90-2526. 90] is a big advantage for us.

[2526. 90-2529. 90] [2529. 90-2532. 90] We are also watching. [2532. 90-2533. 90] Just look at our capacity. [2533. 90-2537. 90] This debt ratio is a bit higher. [2537. 90-2539. 90] And we actually make some investments in the future. [2539. 90-2542. 90] So we still want dividend shares to be photographed.

[2542. 90-2544. 90] The way this year. [2544. 90-2547. 90] In addition, we put every share. [2547. 90-2549. 90] We will let the CFO say. [2549. 90-2551. 90] We will evaluate our estimate. [2551. 90-2554. 90] The growth of the two years. [2554. 90-2547. 90] We do not really want to affect it.

[2557. 90-2559. 90] The price of this stock fluctuates. [2559. 90-2561. 90] or any of its shareholders' equity. [2561. 90-2563. 90] So we actually think that the two pieces are allocated. [2563. 90-2566. 90] Share allocation is one. [2566. 90-2568. 90] What we can accept. [2568. 90-2571. 90] Then it should be one for shareholders.

[2571. 90-2573. 90] A reasonable number. [2573. 90-2574. 90] Thanks. [2577. 90-2579. 90] There are investment advanced questions. [2579. 90-2583. 90] What is the estimated effective tax rate for 2025. [2583. 90-2585. 90] Our current tax rate. [2585. 90-2587. 90] Taiwan is 20%.

[2587. 90-2591. 90] There are 23 26 in Canada of that USA. [2591. 90-2593. 90] So our average should be at [2593. 90-2595. 90] around 21%. [2595. 90-2598. 90] The tax rate in 2024 is 18%. [2598. 90-2600. 90] Because we have some entity. [2600. 90-260. 90] He has some tax credits.

[2601. 90-2602. 90] is the cumulative loss can be offset. [2602. 90-2606. 90] So I think it is about 21%. [2606. 90-2609. 90] should be an estimate of the effective tax rate. [2609. 90-2612. 90] is a separate query. [2612. 90-2614. 90] is the operating cost of the next quarter. [2614. 90-2617. 90] is similar to Q4 of 2024.

[2617. 90-2621. 90] It should be said that our 2025 operating expenses. [2621. 90-2622. 90] should fall every quarter. [2622. 90-2623. 90] 12%. [2623. 90-2625. 90] 12% to 1.4 billion in the middle. [2625. 90-2621. 90] The Q1 has some adjustments. [2627. 90-2631. 90] Perhaps also fall in the middle.

[2631. 90-2633. 90] Between this price point. [2635. 90-2637. 90] In addition. [2639. 90-2642. 90] Ask DLS price point after Mallon enters the market. [2642. 90-2644. 90] How many percent impact. [2644. 90-2646. 90] What is the current price point. [2647. 90-2649. 90] Our price point is to the house.

[2649. 90-2651. 90] So we might not have a way. [2651. 90-2653. 90] For the hostel to answer the price. [2653. 90-2657. 90] There is also insurance Cowbridge in the middle. [2657. 90-2659. 90] DLC insurance. [2662. 90-2653. 90] This I think. [2663. 90-2666. 90] basically the U.S. drug market.

[2666. 90-2669. 90] is actually insurance-based. [2669. 90-2674. 90] So no individual is paying for the drug. [2674. 90-2676. 90] About the Mallon section. [2676. 90-2678. 90] What we see now is ASP. [2678. 90-2669. 90] The price of the sale is not falling. [2680. 90-2682. 90] It is only a slight decrease in quantity like this.

[2683. 90-2685. 90] So we made 40%. [2685. 90-2686. 90] So we made 40%. [2686 90-2689. 90] Mallon is currently one. [2689. 90-2691. 90] It has in the market. [2691. 90-2694. 90] But it didn't use to win the price. [2694. 90-2696. 90] Then we wanted to pick us up.

[2696. 90-2697. 90] So this is the present. [2697. 90-2700. 90] See a relatively stable ASP. [2700. 90-2702. 90] Of course, just entered. [2702. 90-2704. 90] There are some minor competitions. [2704. 90-2706. 90] But now it looks a little more stable. [2709. 90-2710. 90] Excuse me.

[2710. 90-2711. 90] Here are a few questions. [2711. 90-2712.

We are now going to have a Flex Pro Line. Of course, that's when we bought it. But it's not online. It's Q3 online. We're going to add another production line. This production line.

Capital expenditures are also close to US $ 200 million. This is US $ 200 million. This is a simple affirmation. That is also the order of the customer. This will not only increase our production capacity.

It will also increase our efficiency. So it will reduce costs. That second is our Mittsor Sago.

So we're going to install some new packaging lines. So this packaging line costs about 500 to 7 million dollars. It's also quite clear. There are some capital expenditures in Maple Grove. That's the US Minnesota plant.

That's what Deman sees, but we're not that easy to say about them. So this is part of our clients' capital expenditures. That's from the management point of view, I think.

In fact, I think the company has been expanding all the time. They will go to a certain level. Doing a rating will make some reforms. I think this whole organizational chart will make some adjustments. We have always been prepared to say. In fact, the United States.

There are so many factories in the United States.
