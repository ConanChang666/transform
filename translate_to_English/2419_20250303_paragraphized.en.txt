<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to the corresponding sentences per timestamp. The user has divided the content into multiple time intervals, each interval corresponds to a sentence or several words. My task is to reorganize the fragmented sentences into consecutive paragraphs according to logic and context, while keeping the order and content of the original sentence unchanged.

First of all, I read the entire transcript and understood the overall structure and content. It looks like this is the opening remarks of a legal person's briefing, introducing the participants, the agenda, and then the speech content of the chairman of the conference. The speech content is divided into a review of the results of 2024 and a plan to look forward to 2025. Next, I need to determine how to segment it.

During the process, I need to make sure that the corresponding sentences of each timestamp are placed correctly and that there are no omissions or duplicates. At the same time, be careful of the connection between the sentences and make the paragraphs smooth and natural. For example, multiple "Applause Encouragement" repeats may need to be merged into a paragraph to avoid duplicate redundancy.

In addition, it is important to pay attention to some repeated sentences, such as "Let's talk first" appeared twice, need to keep the same, but may be merged into the same paragraph. There is also a blank part of the timestamp, such as [56. 46-58. 46] Welcome and [56. 46-58. 46] Mr. Hsu, who needs to confirm whether it belongs to the same paragraph, may need to merge. In processing Mr. Huang's speech content, it is necessary to identify different topic sections, such as 2024 review, organizational adjustments, new market development, SIA integration, MMA mergers, etc., each topic as a paragraph.

After completing these steps, I will read the whole finishing transcription again to make sure that there are no errors and make sure the format is correct, without using any Markdown, only retain the paragraph structure of the plain text. </think> The current set of media is advanced.

First, let's introduce the two company's chief executive, let's welcome the chairman of Mingtai and Zhongqi Technology, Mr. Huang Wenfang. Then, the chief executive of Mingtai Technology, welcome the general manager of our business. Welcome to the R&D department General Manager of Peishun Chiu.

Finally, it is time for Q&A. Now, we have the Chairman of Mingtai and Zhongqi Technology, Mr. Huang Wenfang, who explains our future goals and prospects for the NCG Group.

Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause.

I would like to share with you what happened in the past year, where we plan to be different from what we have planned, and what we have to look forward to in the future. Before we talk about the outlook, let's first talk about what we should do in 2024, and what happened in 2024. Overall, the situation in 2024 is back. When we talked about this last year, we originally expected the situation in the second half of 2024 to come back, but in fact, it proved that the inventory adjustment of our customers in 2024 was worse than we imagined.

In addition to that, there are other things we promise to do in addition to this. I am here to share with you a report, and then I will share with you what I see now, and then I will talk about 2025 what we want to do. So 2024, one thing we have to do at the time is to pursue growth in a way that includes the recovery of this market.

In general, it is the middle-class interface that makes the middle-class team members more aware of the division of the organization. At the moment, the factory in Nakazaki is 100% dedicated to the production of the middle-class factory, so the hardware developers of Nakazaki themselves are already fully integrated into the development team of the middle-class. The longitudinal effect that we have done is that we want to be able to develop new market new customers, so this is what I mentioned in addition to waiting for the atmosphere to recover, we have to create this engine for growth.

We believe that this section will bring some attention to the SIA group. It is also the integration of SIA. We all know that there is a small company in the middle team of SIA called interactive technology. Interactive technology has a very stable level of EPS every year. In fact, there is a company called SIA.

So, all of these integrations have been completed in 2024. Of course, there are some costs in the integration process, and there are some costs. So, this is probably already completely digested last year. So I want to be an optimised factor for 2024. There was one MMA, but we bought this one in December last year, mainly a microwave device, and it's like a company.

That's what we're doing in 2024. What we're going to do in 2025? That's what we're looking at now in 2025. The middle part we just mentioned last year's stock digestion is slower than expected, but here are the product lines that are different. The mid-months in June and last year's Q3 and Q4 have been showing up for the whole quarter of the year.

So some broadband networks have MSO's climax in this channel. The other part is not the Nordosis part, that is, the telecom-related part, and the switch part is not so clear yet. However, since the end of last year until Q1, we began to notice that there has been a setlist on unspecified models. So we are currently working on some models with some inventory, but there are some materials in a shortage of such a situation. So we believe that the telecom and this part of the switch should be fully consumed in Q2 to ensure the growth momentum in the second half of this year.

So back to the Ming Tai Group itself, there are a few key strategies we will do in 2025, one of which is to focus on investing in the Data Center AI Data Center. We are part of the Data Center.

We just mentioned AI Data Center. Because of the future AI Data Center. The interconnection between the VC of the GPU. The need for a faster access. A communication such as a fractional structure. So.

This one is 6G. Now in the current communication vendor, all of them must be one of the spindles of their development, Naming Tai, basically hope is in the past, like we say.

This is the development of the whole of the switch above. The lesson of that generation above. We used to be more biased. That is, a need for a customer here, and then we did it.

We want to. Change a practice in the past. We want to be among the leading groups in the first wave. We can do it.

At the end of this year, we need to achieve this goal. That's why we are here in Ming Tai. In addition to creating a dedicated team, we do 1. 6G. Some control over the signal.

Included institutions. Includes the entire research and development of this part of the follower. All of them are done here by the dedicated team. In addition to this. We also have a relationship with the big company blogger of Netcom chips.

We wanted to be able to do it in advance. So 1. 6G will be the main focus of our entire research and development this year. It is a Japanese customer. We just got a new Japanese customer last year.

We also have some of the research and development as expected this year. So now the entire research and development stage is very smooth. So we expect that this year's research and development stage is very smooth. So we can start shipping at the end of the year.

A small number of customers shipped to Beijing. The product associated with Wi-Fi 7 shipped. Basically this is our entire product thing is the only one. But that's because last year's Wi-Fi 7 import was not that fast. It's not that fast. We're looking forward to that market this year.

That transition to Wi-Fi 7 can be accelerated. That is why we expect it to be in Q2. The demand for our Japanese market can start shipping first. That just mentioned by the chairman is a new development on this side of the Indian market. We have also done some of the related processes with the Indian market.

So we're all one this month. The airplane road mass production. That's what we've just said about the potential of the Indian market is not to be underestimated. So we're here in the Indian market in the future.

The contribution of the revenue in the market. We expect it to be quite high. We report here. Thank you, General Manager. Next, we will start a presentation on relaunching technology. We welcome Mr. Yu-fa Hui, Chief Financial Officer of Relaunch Technology, to discuss the company's financial situation.

Dear Colleagues, My Girlfriend. Then I restarted the tech report. That's the first thing I'll do for a financial program in 2024. I'll do a description. The resumption of this merger last year. Our combined revenue was 90.8%.

That's the part of the business. I think it's about 3 billion. The average gross profit is 19. 4%. It's also about 2% easier than the previous issue. It's only in the control of the operating fee. It's probably 1.5 billion.

That's probably a savings of about 200 million. So in this part of business net profit. It's basically possible to maintain the financial position of the previous year. Then there's a conclusion to the profit. That net profit before tax is 200 million2.

This is the only way to get the most out of your business, and it is the only way to get the most out of your business. This is the only way to get the most out of your business. This is the only way to get the most out of your business.

It is estimated that 23. 500 million. The larger number of votes is actually in the control of the stock. The stock is probably the part. The previous year was about 8 billion savings. The stock is now about 4 billion. The whole stock is about 1.2 billion.

That's what we've been talking about over the past few quarters. Continue to increase the control system of this benchmark. There are actually some benefits. So everyone's library is a trend for the next quarter. So the current weather is probably around 143 days.

That's more of a simple explanation for the financial sector. Then there's the general manager Zhou Yang Zhi. Conduct company product and market strategy briefings. Well, the industry's investment advanced and media friends. Next, I'll report on our product and market collation strategy.

Our total revenue for the last year in 2024 began with the third quarter. This is reflected in the quarterly growth. We are in the market for this product with limited bandwidth. We see that the entire demand is gradually coming back. Then, especially when this third quarter starts. This third quarter starts until the fourth quarter.

That even continued through the first quarter of this year. We saw limited bandwidth. This market and this demand. Including the depreciation of the customer in this inventory. All of them have been gradually improved. We have also seen gradual growth in our performance.

That's on top of the development of new customers. We're at Docsys 4. 0. Then Asha 3. 1's Home Gateway. We also have this development.

Product development is at the forefront. That is, in this Gateway product that combines this Wi-Fi 7. We are mainly in Europe and North America.

We are also actively expanding Docsys products. Including this fiber-optic product. G‐PoM and XGS‐PoM products. Then Wi‐Fi 7 Extended. Includes Duo‐Band and Tri‐Band.

That's 5G. That's what makes us apart from Docsys. The combination of products on Docsys can be more abundant. Let our product line correspond to this MSO. Or the telecom operator exclusive Telecom part. The ability to own the combination of this product is rich.

We were in the retail market last year. Compared to the previous year. Our products in the retail market. The market grew more than twice. The part of the integration was effective. Just mentioned by the chairman.

In 2024, we were able to have more resources to invest, including software and cloud platforms to build a stronger core competitiveness. We saw in Docsys 2024 that our main or our revenue source is growing in the Docsys section, where you can see that the portion of this Pump is relatively large, and then the portion of this Retail Market and S&P is gradually growing with the Wi-Fi, which is the next three years we will invest more resources in the Docsys part to bring this market, as well as the planning of the product, the development of the product can enhance its occupation.

The synergistic effect of integration brings us a lot of benefits in the second half of last year, so we will continue to expand the synergistic benefits of integration to reduce the cost of cost and original purchase of our products, and just mentioned in the cloud platform, we can see our product planning in fact, we focus on Docsys and Archard3. 1 Dodocsys 4. 0 and Archard3. 1 In Pong part 10G, then the integration on the platform and Wi-Fi7 form a Home Gateway or Pong-based Home Gateway, and then all the product planning in JL5G, such as the development of the cloud platform can form a management interface, provide our operators including MSO and Telecom to enhance their service value and their value, this is the software development and resources we have to invest in the next three years of the guidance, and thank the general manager of the company explained the next time, Q&A time we have the team to reply to the front to ask questions if we can ask you if we can ask if we can ask if we can ask you ask questions if we will ask you will ask questions if we will ask you will ask questions if we will ask you will ask questions about the questions about the questions about the questions about the questions about the mic service staff. This trend of AI Data Center is certain to change some of the market situation, which means that in the past may be more clear, the data center back to the data center, enterprise type, but now looks like a business-oriented customer, he will start to have AI Data Center product line, so when thinking about AI Data Center, we are the traditional data center, the data center in the customer is a group, and the AI Data Center here must have, in addition, there is a so-called enterprise-based AI Data Center, we are so different, so for us, in addition to the customers we know in the past, we want to expand the AI Data Center cooperation, we also hope to move forward to this more traditional data center customers, because I want to provide more and more vendors in the market can do this work, so we want to make a good conclusion, thank you, just after there is a one, the chairman you, let me know that I understand the production part, Vietnam, Vietnam 50% U.S. If you want to think about it, you can think about it, but if you want to think about it, you can think about it, and if you want to think about it, you can think about it, and if you want to think about it, you can think about it, and if you want to think about it, you can think about it, but if you want to think about it, you can think about it, and if you want to think about it, you can think about it, you can think about it, and if you want to think about it, you can think about it, why not think about it?

We all have at least two alternatives to this part, and one of them must be a non-typical one in China. Because you do not know that in addition to the place of origin, there will be no charge to the inner area, because the place of origin is well transferred, so this is something we do ourselves for and for planning. Then again, it is good to make good use of EMS. Because I think of this issue of tariffs, we are all paying attention to the news every day, it can come quickly, it can also go fast, so we are unlikely to build our own factory one day to late, so we are now making good use of EMS.

This is an example of how we have been thinking about how we are planning a global supply chain. In the past, we have been thinking about how we are operating efficiency, which is not very low cost, but now we are thinking about whether our supply chain is next to our factory, which is not a satellite, which surrounds the concept of satellite, which is no longer this idea. The current idea is global supply chain, that is, when your factory has also been there, you have to think about where your board is the best, from the point of view of transportation, from its cost point of view, that is probably an example.

That is, thank you for that capital. Well, we just mentioned 47870. 6000, now the main target customers and markets are in North America. That Japanese customers here, we are new customers of the show, and now he is a corporate-level customer, then the product demand is below 100, so we hope to talk about the transformation of Energize Core in the future, we start to see more than 100 to 400, which is now falling.

Thank you. I think there are a few factors he has in mind about the Maori, one of which is the influence of the factory and the material here, and the other is the Model Mix. That is, if we look at the performance level of this operation, the current factory integration will certainly have a good benefit for us Gross Quadrant here, but at the same time, because we are also exploring some emerging markets, which is the increase in these markets, which may lead to some of the Maori portfolio problems, so of course we want to be able to consider this balance again, in the absolute profit to rise above, that is our goal.

Is there an answer from Cai Ah Wei? Well, help, just mentioned that, because your question is in WK, the answer you have just created is very accurate, and the rest of the temporary lines we will start mass production tonight.

The Chinese revenue is currently very low, that is, the actual number I am currently in the half-year, no, but I know it is less than 10%, but we can give you some number, thank you. Well, everyone, here are two questions to ask: the first is we just mentioned that there is this production money transfer to Mingtai here, so I asked what is the plan for our original production here? Because I remember the words of the United States last year we merged more than the production capacity in mainland China, then it was originally in Vietnam there were some production capacity, how to apply this part later?

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First of all, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to make sure that no word is missing. The user specifically emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check if the timestamp is correct and make sure that the correct sentences are mapped at each point in time. Then, I will read them one by one, identifying which sentences belong to the same paragraph or topic. For example, the parts of a certified factory and factory integration may belong to the same paragraph, while the parts of a 5G dedicated network and a low-track satellite are another topic.

At the same time, to deal with some possible errors or duplicates, such as [2968. 38-2969. 38] We have a "one" and [2969. 38-2971. 38] We may need to merge, or check if there is a timestamp error. Also, the terms "Rennington" and "FollowMate" mentioned by the user need to retain the original, to ensure correctness. There are some technical terms such as "B. A. A" may need to be verified whether the user requests are correct, so keep the original. During the finishing process, I will arrange the sentences of each topic in chronological order, and connect to paragraphs according to semantic. For example, on the 5G network, starting from this piece of the 5G network, to the "clear needs", these sentences should be arranged consistently.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp and avoid breakage of paragraphs caused by time jumps. After completing these steps, read the compiled paragraph verbatim to ensure that all user requirements are met. </think> The following is a paragraph verbatim (completely retaining all the original content, undeleted, rewritten, or condensed any sentence):

It's a good idea to move people to this place, which means that Nakazaki no longer owns its own production, but that's the concept. So its original factory, there are several aspects of planning. Thank you.

And the second thing I would like to ask is that there are actually two things we should consider before we are likely to be relatively low in revenues, but the continued development is the part of the 5G dedicated network and the low-track satellite. Can we probably mention the two of us in the years to come? The 5G dedicated network of this piece, although it is slow, but we have seen more and more projects. Because we can see from our group, there is also this SI company, in our business, the actual application of 5G, has become more and more.

So we are still looking forward to 5G, and that part of Ming Tai is an ongoing investment. So I believe that this part should be the more and more clear need. This part of the low-track satellite, this part of our shipping, is still small. Now it looks like we have this low-track satellite in the United States, many companies are now in touch, but also found that the big-track satellite is growing, and there is a trend like this one.

So this part is still a part of our future potential. Thank you Rennington. Please help, just talk about the political impact of the interest, I ask the customer if there are some plans to do something, and then if there is a cost for moving, or some cost for local production, can you share it with the customer? This is the question.

Thank you. I'll answer the first question, and the second one, just like to answer it. The factory, the first question, we can also ask this Chung Qi Lady here, because she has a strength here, that is, the customer has a requirement to produce radar, this part you talk about. Now, because in response to the US government's tariff policy, this leads to reality, and then to the United Nations immigration policy, we must also deal with it in advance.

Well, as you all know, it was more than a year ago that Biden had sent out a billion dollars of this grant, a request for this FollowMate grant, so it really has a relationship. If it was a fiber-optic product, it would have to be B. A. A Buy American Build America, with such a request. At that time, we had to deal with this request and cooperate with North American customers, so we were prepared for an EMS production in North America. So you must also know that the production cost in North America is far greater than the production cost in Vietnam.

So, in this case, the cost can be completely transferred. I think that this part, which is understood by the current customers, is basically that, should be the inheritance of this factory associated with these tariffs, we basically think that most of them can be transferred. Well, we can answer. Well, the data center, the AI Data Center part, we now have more control over, in the first stage we will be from the European customers here to cut in.

We are now looking for a way to get the most out of this, but now, we are going to have to wait a couple of years to get the most out of it. The strategy we are taking now is to select the big computer products that will be considered as the watch makers, and we want to do so by working with these software vendors. However, the whole relationship is still in the process of being prepared for some communication with our customers.

Here is a transcript of the paragraph after the reordering:. If these individuals rec avoid the good for him. He Khali soni, etc..

Thank you very much for your investment in advanced questions. Thank you very much for the briefing and Q&A from the management team of Ming Tai and Chung Shi. The explanation will be finished today. Thank you very much for your investment in advanced participation.
