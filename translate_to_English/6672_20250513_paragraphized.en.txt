<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-generated verbatim texts and convert them into paragraph verbatim texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text can not be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed verbally and keep the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. Users want to integrate these sequenced sentences into a coherent paragraph, but each sentence must be kept as it is, without any changes. This means that I need to reorganize the timestamps and sentences so that the paragraphs are smooth, while keeping all the original information. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or paragraph.

It is important to note that some sentences may have jumps in time, such as a missing time period in the middle (e.g. after 13. 00-17. 00 to 19. 00-20. 00), but the user requests not to delete anything, so the jumps must be kept and may be handled in empty lines or in an appropriate manner in the paragraph. During the processing process, I will check every sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, there are some possible mistakes or coherence in the verbs provided by the user, such as "Mr. Chung" appears separately, and may need to confirm whether it belongs to the continuation of the previous sentence. However, according to the user's requirements, it cannot be rewritten, so it must remain the same.

For example, after [13. 00-17. 00] is [19. 00-20. 00], there is an interval of 2 seconds in the middle, which may mean that the speaker has a pause in the middle, but the user requests not to delete anything, so these timestamps need to be kept and handled appropriately in the paragraph. When consolidating paragraphs, I will sort the timestamps and sentences in order, but place the timestamps in front of the sentence, bracketed with brackets, and keep the original format. At the same time, make sure that each sentence is independent, but according to the consistency of the content, it may be combined into paragraphs, but must maintain the independence of each sentence.

[5. 00-8. 00] First, let's talk about our commander Zhong Jianren. [8. 00-9. 00] Mr. Chung. [13. 00-17. 00] We also welcome our chief financial officer Jennifer. [19. 00-20. 00] Good.

[72. 00-75. 00] Differentiation and so on. [75. 00-77. 00] That kind of scale. [77. 00-78. 00] Expand. [78. 00-79. 00] So we. [79. 00-81. 00] Pursuing. [81. 00-83. 00] High profit high trade.

[83. 00-84. 00] Then. [84. 00-86. 00] Come along with us. [86. 00-87. 00] Compete. [87. 00-88. 00] Of course, that's something to do. [88. 00-89. 00] Special. [89. 00-90. 00] So we emphasize.

[90. 00-91. 00] We want to increase interest. [91. 00-92. 00] Each aspect. [92. 00-93. 00] Provided. [93. 00-94. 00] On. [94. 00-96. 00] Active water temperature special products above. [96. 00-97. 00] Make first-class entry.

[97. 00-98. 00] Then. [98. 00-99. 00] Buy a customer. [99. 00-101. 00] New development. [101. 00-102. 00] Sure. [102. 00-104. 00] Do. [104. 00-105. 00] So.

[105. 00-106. 00] That is our strategy. [106. 00-109. 00] would like to do global interaction. [109. 00-112. 00] then provide a full range of technology with products. [112. 00-114. 00] Guests can come to our company. [114. 00-115. 00] Any. [115. 00-117. 00] Any corner of the world.

[117. 00-118. 00] Buy. [118. 00-119. 00] The products they need. [119. 00-122. 00] We want to position ourselves as such. [122. 00-128. 00] This next is the strengths of our company. [128. 00-133. 00] One is to see these materials. [113. 00-136. 00] basically the materials that can be found in the market.

[136. 00-140. 00] is a company about traditional bullets or modern bullets. [140. 00-142. 00] The middle of that is more special. [142. 00-144. 00] It is like my company is the charm of Taizouga. [144. 00-145. 00] or. [145. 00-147. 00] The range of Yaan products. [147. 00-148. 00] The current market share is probably.

[148. 00-152. 00] Around 20% of the world. [15. 00-154. 00] The main application is military. [154. 00-156. 00] There are some semiconductor testing. [156. 00-157. 00] So very high. [157. 00-159. 00] Then the rate is about sixty-seven. [159. 00-161. 00] We are also.

[161. 00-163. 00] The world's largest light bulb. [163. 00-165. 00] With some heat dissipation materials. [165. 00-167. 00] The base substrate company. [167. 00-169. 00] And just like us. [169. 00-171. 00] We are all very hot now. [171. 00-173. 00] Our company is called in English.

[173. 00-175. 00] This piece is still in progress. [175. 00-177. 00] So we only have one. [177. 00-179. 00] From the lowest level of the market. [179. 00-181. 00] To the highest level of the company. [181. 00-183. 00] We also have IC carrier boards. [183. 00-185. 00] These are particularly emphasized here.

[185. 00-186. 00] We still have. [186. 00-190. 00] Similar high heat-resistant materials. [190. 00-192. 00] Then on the soft and hard combined board. [192. 00-195. 00] On the top three companies in the world. [195. 00-197. 00] PV electricity on our shoes is not glued. [197. 00-198. 00]

[198. 00-199. 00] Free. [199. 00-201. 00] The one is free. [201. 00-202. 00] In addition, it is heat dissipation. [202. 00-203. 00] Semiconductor. [203. 00-204. 00] Or. [204. 00-206. 00] Some tests above.

[207. 00-209. 00] We also tested these above. [209. 00-210. 00] Required. [210. 00-213. 00] The company should be. [213. 00-215. 00] A focus on the manufacturer of public products. [215. 00-216. 00] That is currently.

[218. 00-221. 00] For some new applications to break through. [221. 00-223. 00] Existing products. [223. 00-226. 00] It is difficult to buy. [224. 00-226. 00] So on the new company. [226. 00-228. 00] All of these materials are available. [228. 00-223. 00]

[230. 00-231. 00] Performance. [231. 00-234. 00] But it is no glass solid material. [234. 00-236. 00] This kind of public product. [236. 00-239. 00] The company is also the world. [239. 00-241. 00] The only one focusing on this product. [241. 00-243. 00] So it looks like the current.

[243. 00-245. 00] More and more applications. [245. 00-246. 00] So we have. [246. 00-248. 00] There is a future trend. [248. 00-250. 00] We specifically emphasize. [250. 00-252. 00] We can do global charity. [252.0 00-254. 00] So we are ourselves.

[254. 00-256. 00] Great Britain. [256. 00-257. 00] Germany, Europe. [257. 00-258. 00] with American Bull. [258. 00-261. 00] You have your own investment company. [261. 00-263. 00] employees worldwide. [263. 00-265. 00] There are 70 employees in Taiwan.

[265. 00-267. 00] So it can be done. [267. 00-269. 00] The customer has a commitment. [269. 00-270. 00] The warehouse is located there. [270. 00-272. 00] Let them do it. [272. 00-273. 00] Take the ticket company. [273. 00-274. 00] And we are.

research, research, development, our own formula, the formula of the value of the formula, we are, one of the most important.

East and West, we are our own, we are our own, we are in the factory, we are in the reaction, we are in the back.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Because the current formula is basically the position, so we will be there.

It's important to note, because it's important, because it's important, and this analysis is one of a kind.

This is the new interpretation, here we are, of course, compared to the navigational workshop practice, delivered, this is where this certification is located.

That's it. Certification is difficult. It's just like a factory in Taiwan. PCC customers.

We wanted to do this, but we didn't do it until now, and that's it.

Next: Introduction. Measurement of the product. Of course we are going to hand over. On some products, it is the high-energy conductivity of 5G 6G.

We've got a full range of products, and now we're not.

AI hosts. There are a lot of hands-on communication. Many products are certified. Our company is also high-speed.

There is also a horse 8 product. There is also a high-speed motor of the horse 9.

Customer recognition. At least. PCC customer recognition. Also.

It's also the same. In some tests. It's the AI chip test. Basically. A little bit more to get into the industry. And then it's high speed.

There is also a medical. The version used by Lianan. We have recently developed a horse6. The version that does not fluctuate. We have recently received a lot of publicity.

This is why we are constantly introducing new products on these materials, so that we can also go to the film products. This product allows us to make because it is not laminating, so it is not enough to make something that needs to be purchased. Many of these chips on this process, it can have a good solution, do not need too complicated process, replace it with general materials, because you want it to be laminating, you have to be able to be very precise, this is not successful.

This is a major problem, but now this problem becomes an important focus, because we have a lot of products, we have a lot of products, we have a lot of products, we have a lot of cheap weekly transport, this is the second company we have developed a new is good, this is the only thing that we have mentioned is that we have always been here to help reduce the use of love weapons, they do not have a lot of power, in fact, there are a lot of rewards on these chips, and in fact, there are a lot of rewards on these chips, the product is in the test is a focus, this is the process of introducing our product structure sales, this is mainly about these three materials on the sun, so we focus on this product material, because the general material is to be ice, because we have a lot of products, we have a lot of products, we have a good week turnover, this is the second company has been developing new, this, this is that we have just the only the only mentioned in the new, which is that we have been talking about the only a lot of these products, and that we need to the next next next next next time, and the next next time, the new products, the next time, the new products, the new products, and the next, the next next, the next, the next, the new products, the next, and the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the new, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the new, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the next, the next, the new, the new, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new,

We hope that in the quantity above, then there is not enough material, slowly in the market to get the hope, you solve our things, in fact, money is the price, then push to the science and technology dependent, and save.

In addition, we constantly implement the application in the new market, so some customers on some AI orbit satellites and wind turbines have got any of their currency. These are the future needs, so we have been producing in the future market, and many of us have no products in the market. So as long as there is such a demand, these buyers or wind turbines, it is relatively high pulse, products in action, and also get the currency.

In the past, we have been silently getting results in the past. This is Tempro, and we should be able to provide this material at home. In the past few years, we have also got several fights, because of the Chinese import of Glacier to 120%, Rogers products to China is really very difficult. They used to be people in some companies to search for Rogers' goods in the market, and then we were stopped, to provide some people, for some institutions to make us talents, which was never easy.

That's all we can see. These should be three series, then we'll mention six series, most of which are spacecraft, and we'll be able to detect them for ourselves. And then we're more special is the naval, and we all know that we're our own world because of the war on the naval ship, and then the last eight wars, all of which will stimulate this force. This we think is not a long-term need at least, because most of our problems will lose the federal signal of the world, and then be saved and don't recover, so I think we'll find ways to build our own Tempro, and we'll use our Tempro scholarship more and more.

In addition, we have a lot of growth in the past three years in the semiconductor industry, it should be because the demand for AI is more and more strong, then these products are very expensive, so it must test its design, or its production process, and whether it is very fast in aging. So it is almost 100 designs, now almost 100% design, or at least 10 times more test energy, so this gloves will be used very much, and then this is the intelligent we are going to go to Asia. This is our series of materials can all be used in the English industry, multi-lingual wind bar European industry, called Bansal, this kind of family size is the product, then we have some products, SpaceX along with this, so we will also do some new goods, then train the road, EA and MARV, in fact, we will be a lot of new products, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the product, we will be a lot of the next, we will be the product, the next, we will be the next, we will be the product, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the product, we will be the product, we will be the product, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the product, we will be the next, we will be the next, the new, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the next, the new, the hot, we will be the next, we will be the hot, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the hot, we will be the next, we will be the next, we will be the product, we will be the product, we will be the hot, we will be the hot, we will be the next, the next, we will

The following is a re-routing paragraph type script: This is a hot end. Another time, we can make this very precise. This is because our products are very slow and do not pursue a lot of production as many opponents as we are today. So we are pursuing quantities, so the products and items we produce are of course more efficient. However, in high-level sports, every test is basically going to pass, because this time we are in pursuit of quantity, the equipment is of course, but on average we have a large part of it, we have some level of process to do this equipment, and even the same technology, which may be implemented by people.

This is the best value for the average stability feature. This is what we do in this average half body is another value, and this we do a lot of improvement, so we are faced with different customer requirements, so he in this project, there is a lot of technology is unified into the system together, the movement that is becoming more and more high-level, then we have to make a future we will still be impressed with things on the stage will be released series of these products. Now we have customers we want to do these things, these things are now zero star AI development to 713 remember that there is no real bill to find, because now we have been testing to use 15 to K3 or to say that the ultra-high proportion of the high-quality material, that is abrupt regret, and today we are talking about the more about the technology that can be able to do some of these concepts today.

Wet. This market is very large. Wet. Let's home. Very bad 10 times, but because of its high thermal conductivity.

And if we do that, they will be able to do it, and if they are able to do it, they will be able to do it, and they will be able to do it, and they will be able to do it.

These materials are able to degrade the use of this material, because it is pressed, can be converted into various sizes, all sizes, that is, if it is ceramic.

That's right. What size is it? It's very, very difficult to process. So I think there's something to say. Here's a little indication.

This is us, these manufacturers in the world, BMW, British, Omi, Marsaredi.

North Orleans, we are all, we are the wind, we just talked about, we are the world's largest manufacturer of materials.

It is easy to damage, or it will lose, for example, the light will be darker, or it will be easy to break.

or its performance will be worse. Or its life will be short. So now the heat pipe. Unfortunately, the danger zone is only recently China. Because of the fire truck incident.

So they now have the regulations. After July 1st, all batteries will be burned. The turkey will explode.

Now, there are a lot of customers, and there may be a requirement, provide material testing, and then, just above the heat pipe.

The other is that they do it. more preventable. the temperature to what extent. jump. that is, jump. can not stop. so they are now.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcriptions. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed into any sentence, all sentences must be retained and arranged in chronological order into paragraphs.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided to confirm each timestamp and the corresponding sentence. It looks like each entry has a time frame and corresponding text. Next, I need to arrange these entries in chronological order and combine them into a coherent paragraph while maintaining the integrity of each sentence. It should be noted that the user mentions the word "penetrating transcription" may mean that each entry is a separate sentence or phrase that needs to be connected correctly. For example, some sentences may belong to the same paragraph, need to be merged, while others may belong to different paragraphs and need to be segmented.

In the process, I check each entry step by step to ensure that the timestamp corresponds correctly, and the sentence sequence is correct. For example, timestamps start at 190. 88 and end at 2268. 32, the time interval between each entry may represent the rhythm or pause of speech, but the user requests not to delete anything, so all timestamps and corresponding sentences must be retained. Also, be aware that some possible spelling errors or non-continuous terms such as "MI", "MOSFET", and other terms are correct, but the user does not request to modify the content, so even if there are errors, it is necessary to keep the original.

At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. Finally, I will read through the entire converted paragraph-based verbatim to check if all sentences are correctly contained, with no omissions or duplications, and the order of the timestamps is correct. Make sure that no explanation or summaries are added, and that the verbatim verbs are converted entirely according to the user's requirements.

Do not let it become too big for you, it is like a slippery slope.

We are on this material, especially in the military. We have recently been on the military. This discovery is that the usage is getting bigger and bigger. The main reason is because it has high engineering.

Engineering is getting more and more. So you see this time it was built. It was a long way from where the object was. And when it was detected, it worked together.

It can be integrated into some of its detection products. So it does it when it goes. It can be used for soft boards. Or more than that, it doesn't have feet. You make it right here. Then from here, the most important thing is.

It's a good buy. Because military workers make it 7 times more expensive. It doesn't really manage the material. It's 3 times more expensive. Then this material.

We also have a home in Guangdong. This is so high. Do the products you rely on at high speed. When the launch is too smooth to sell, and then this year it started to increase. A lot of work.

Some of the bases are listed here. We're currently looking at this, here, here, and here.

This impression to 45 is officially mass production. There are two or three businesses. So, because of the opening, this customer began to hope. This inquiry more and more.

You will not see it, but you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it, you will see it.

We can do it, we can do it, I can only say, mainly this strategy, the development of the process.

We will be there in the future, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there, we will be there.

12 years. 16 years of conservation period. Up to now. Because it is actually a small amount.

We're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here last year.

We don't really have to, so you have to do your own three-step process, and then all of them.

We all know the truth, and we all know the truth, and we all know the truth, and we all know the truth.

We're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here, we're here.

Now. A state of gross profit margin. is 30. 1. Compare. QOQ is right. It is probably 1. 8.

That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

We have some processing costs, yes, because of this year, there are various, training business, limited long-term.

So, this is the processing fee, compared to last year, there is a holiday period.

That's right, that's all, that's all, that's all, that's all, that's all, that's all, that's all, that's all.

We have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it, we have seen it."

We divide it into general materials. Special materials with other materials. That general material. In the first quarter, the word is more than 40%. About 30%.

In fact, the past few seasons. It's probably already less than 50. Well, now it's about 40% up and down. Then what is the number of special materials?

Now look at this material part. Exceed the recommendation. What is the part?. It contains three special materials that have just been mentioned. One is a PI906 substrate.

The second is non-vacuum PT. That of course contains 901 fines. There are many other fines. It contains the M6 fines that have just been mentioned. That is, non-vacuum PT is the material. Then another is the heat dissipation material.

This is the basic part of the substrate. Because we have a variety of different base substrates. Plus, because we have overseas subsidiaries.

We do some TREATING material. This includes flowing wood or equipment, etc. But it also includes coming in. Together, it is more than 50. That is, if we are self-consolidating. Non-flowing glue PT is about 6 to 7% for the time being.

The substrate 901. It sounds like there is a lot of room. It is also about 6 to 7%. It is a high-speed material. It is a high-speed low-low material. It is about 4% lower.

That's another heat dissipation material about. This is 30 to 30. Because they all expand a lot. Then the NCCl part. This is the non-core product part. Now it's about 8% lower.

In total, about 50 to 53% of this is the case. The rest is the other materials to sell. The sale of some materials drink convenience goods, etc. So, of course, do a witness about more reports. Well, let's take a look at the first quarter of the financial structure of the company.

It is not the first month of the month of Ramadan, nor is it the first month of Ramadan, nor is it the first month of Ramadan, nor is it the first month of Ramadan, nor is it the first month of Ramadan, nor is it the last month of Ramadan, nor is it the first day of Ramadan, nor is it the first day of Ramadan, nor is it the first day of Ramadan, nor is it the day of Ramadan, nor is it the day of Ramadan, nor is it the day of Ramadan, nor the day of Ramadan, nor the day of Ramadan, nor the day of Ramadan.

This is mainly due to the relatively low turnover rate in the first quarter. And the first quarter report has been reported. So the cost rate will be slightly lower. So we can see the first quarter.

It is better than last year's fourth quarter, which is just outside the industry, because last year's fourth quarter of the gold to Haili, and the other is more human, so it is.

It's the first quarter of this year, so there's no big difference, so don't be too hard on yourself, it's going to be worth the effort.

I uploaded the earnings report. So. Talk in the first quarter. The gold that I've done now is 7200 million. The four seasons are a little familiar. There's a slight change in US status.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for we have sinned, and are filled with the knowledge of the truth, and are filled with the knowledge of the truth.

That's just saying that our current cash position is relatively high. It's mainly because we want to release it next. You know, basically, we're dividends. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

The following is a re-arranged paragraph verbatim:. A slightly higher performance in the current capital. [2614. 88-2617. 48]. The money went down a little after the dividend was paid in July. [2617. 48-2620. 52].

[2620. 52-2623. 96]. Therefore, we are still looking forward to the relative poor performance of the current funds. [2623. 96-2626. 92]. Because the financial position of the company is still self-confidence. [2626. 92-2630. 80].

[2630. 80-2645. 08]. This year's gold passed, this year's gold passed in March. [2632. 08-2641. 20]. We need to send 3.35 this year, which is flat compared to last year. [2641. 20-2645. 88]. Although last year there was the traditional value of death consumption, it seems to be said.
