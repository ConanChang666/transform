<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request to organize the provided transcription fragments into paragraph-based transcriptions. First, I need to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the content corresponding to each point in time. The user emphasizes that it cannot delete, rewrite or condensate any sentence, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order and maintains the integrity of all information.

First of all, I check the structure of the original transcript. It looks like each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to combine the sentences arranged in chronological order into consecutive paragraphs while retaining the original timestamps and content. It should be noted that some sentences may be continuous, but the content belongs to the same topic and should be merged into the same paragraph.

For example, the introduction of company capital, the number of employees, production bases, and subsidiaries may belong to the same paragraph. Similarly, the introduction of gross profit margin changes and the product portfolio should be placed in the same paragraph. In addition, the introduction of the product line and the part of the market strategy also need to be segmented. During the processing process, I need to make sure that no timestamp is missing and that each sentence is in the correct position. At the same time, pay attention to whether the interval between timestamps is reasonable, whether there is jumping or repeating. For example, there is a timestamp in the original content from [45. 00-50. 00 to [50. 00-56. 00], and there is no interval in between, which means that the two sentences are consecutive and should be merged into the same paragraph.

In addition, the user mentions "not to delete any sentences, not summary", so all sentences, including potentially duplicated or redundant information must be retained. For example, the description of the subsidiaries in different regions may require segmentation, but the introduction of each subsidiary should be separate to remain clear. In the finishing process, it is also important to pay attention to the consistency of the sentences. For example, when referring to different subsidiaries, it may be necessary to use the connection words or adjust the sentence structure to make the paragraphs smoother, but the original intention must remain unchanged.

At the same time, ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, logical and clear, in line with user requirements. In summary, my steps are: 1. Analyzing the structure and theme of the original content; 2. Consolidating sentences based on the subject and the logic unit; 3. Maintaining the integrity of the timestamp and content; 4. Ensuring paragraphs are consistent and not missing any information; and 5. Finally, verify that the format and content conform to user requirements.

First, I would like to briefly introduce the company's current situation. We have a total of 14.9 billion people with over 1000 employees. Our entire group is currently in Changhua, we have a production base, and we have our entire R&D sales, and the related administrative team are all in Changhua's headquarter here. Some of our subsidiaries are located in Zhubei, focusing on the research and development of Homipoleda and AIDAS related systems.

In addition, we also have a subsidiary in North America, which is ITM, which is mainly for the promotion and sale of this engine parts market. We have two production bases, one in Taiwan and one in Shanghai. In North America, we are mainly a division of different parts in this market and in North America, which is mainly from Taiwan, including TPMS switches and radar parts.

In addition, we have the reliability of this product, because after all, our industry in this automotive field, its reliability requirements are very high, so we have a very comprehensive investment in this laboratory, all of our products will do the relevant verification and testing in this laboratory, after all, we can only produce and sell. And because there are a lot of product lines, we will be able to introduce, through the integration and integration of these different sensor components, and then provide different applications and systems in different markets. Well, then we for the first half of the year is Q1.

The main thing is that the subsidiary here is such as security monitoring and system integration, a relatively low gross profit margin, the industry part is actually very high gross profit margin, such as switch products and SENSOR products, about 45 to 55%, the TPMS part is about 55 to 60% of the middle, the millimeter wave radar in the AM part we can also be more than 50%, the OEM part about 25 to 35% of the middle. But this is the subsidiary here because there are more industrial characteristics of the project, so it is relatively easy to change the gross profit margin.

The first is our electric and automotive-related sensor products, including the oil pressure sensor speed sensor knock sensor, and the switch you see in your car almost everything we do. This part lasts for many years. This part is very stable. This year, we will keep in mind that the whole people in the past period of the epidemic is affected by the weather, and then the case of the lack of IC when you can buy a new car, in fact, the old car is going to continue to be very advantageous to us, because the old car is going to be broken, so this part of our switch and sensor products are mainly promoted to this aftermarket part, which is the replacement part.

This is also the trend of the whole market, because if the situation is very serious, people may be more cautious to look at this, and then do not change the car, the old car to continue to carry on the market is actually a very big help for this part of the market. The second is TPMS, the part of TPMS is mainly and about 90% of us is aftermarket, is the replacement. We have sensors, but the most important thing is that we have a generic tire pressure sensor system, is one for all the way on the road, that is, this TPMS in its car when it is not powered, can use our system, as long as we have this tool, it is basically all the vehicle on the road.

In addition, we have also introduced the TPMS for this spherical model for this larger commercial or large car, so we continue to improve in this part. At present, we also have a new model of tire pressure sensing system, and we are also pushing this is a special market such as electric motorcycles or this balance car.

This is the fourth part of this current sensor for high current and high voltage, our current sensor is the most accurate in the world. 08% of this sensor, mainly for this electric vehicle or charging window energy storage market. Well, we are about to introduce it again, mainly in the part of the good rice radar just mentioned, we have a mid-range front anti-collision radar, well, we have a short distance, and there is a large car for this inner wheel, we put on the side of the radar is a blind zone detection radar.

We also have this kick radar, the main thing is to replace our capacitive system.

We are also developing this 4D radar, which is in addition to the radar that is required for the full range of vehicles, and our full range of development, we know that with this whole is the market advance, as well as the price level of the automotive market to increase, we continue to move forward. In addition to this 4D radar, we further research the next generation of radar with higher CP value. Our traditional radar, as you can see, we are using more than the PCB antenna, the Roger version, but its cost is relatively high.

In the first half of the year, the first half of the year, the first half of the year, whether it is related to orbit, or the communication and fire and other systems, the case has been carried in, in fact, a lot of cases, and that part of their revenue is still stable. However, this year, its ratio is slightly lower, mainly because they are like the first half of the year, if this part of the year, they are not the weakest of the contract, which is not the first month, then the month of the month is less recognized, the next month is higher. The overall situation of that in this part, in fact, they tend to be more than the first half of the year, but each year, the first half of the first half of the year, they actually accounted for the lowest, mainly the contract weakness, but in fact that they continue to advance.

In addition, we are working with T21 international manufacturers to continue to cooperate with him, and we are fighting for more projects, and this part of the year should have some further progress and news. Well, we will also use this HOMIPO radar to a variety of different sides, so we will also use this HOMIPO radar to a variety of different sides, including special vehicles, RV engineering vehicles, mine truck blenders, and we are currently fighting for a support vehicle in North America, so this part should have a progress in the second half of the year.

This is the part of intelligent farming, like the part of a motor vehicle we install a radar behind it, that part is because the US government has continued to carry on with this more special model is the level of safety required to improve, that part will use our HOMIPO radar to detect the rear, if the rear because it is something like this sometimes happens at home, because the children are not found nearby when we cut grass, but it is actually preventable, so in this part we continue to work with our customers in this system.

In addition, the market for agricultural and animal husbandry vehicles and related markets continues to advance. In addition, our Bluetooth TPMS, we also progress to this market of flat and electric vehicles, and continue to ship, just because they are part of the OE, the quantity of which will be constantly stacked up and will continue to advance each vehicle.

It uses millimeter wave radar heat-as-a-chair integration system. We have moved forward at this intersection. The detection is when it is blown down. If there are any obstacles at the intersection, whether it is a car or a person. We will immediately alert you.

The train can be immediately stopped by notice. That part. This part of Taiwan Railway. This part of this intersection is safe. The whole safety factor is increased a lot.

We also continue to apply this radar to the fields related to this solution. Here is an example. It is very widely used. This is what we are at the intersection. As long as there is a red-green light, of course, it passes through the red-green light.

We know that. I should stop now. But there is no red light at this junction. It is very much. Because the width of the road is not too large. We may need to go and install this red light.

It is only through the reflection mirror, but the reflection mirror is passive, and we often see the news. It is to wipe because it is very dirty. It is the drama of the night.

Whether it is dust or dirt, the whole card goes up. You really don't have to clean it. It's really hard to see. It's also very difficult to see. It's its visual distance.

But there are times when some people may say. This car may look like a car. It's too fast. You can't. So we also take advantage of our HOMIPO radar. To integrate such an item.

We use HOMIPO radar. It is mounted on this pole. It uses this light and LED signage to warn you. It's just like coming in the car. It's detecting a car that looks like coming in. Even people can detect it.

That's what it's all about. It's about seeing a car. It's about letting him know that you're like a car coming in. You're slowing down. And the HOMIPO radar detects the distance is very far away. It's an application like ours right now.

Our detection is more than a hundred meters. So a warning is more than a hundred meters away. It's like coming to a car far away. It's capable of detecting. Then tell it to come to the car.

Be careful of what you say, for the hour is near; for the hour is near; for the hour is near; for the hour is near; for the hour is near; for the hour is at hand.

There are many intersections with no red and green lights. There are some intersections with four, three, and four mirrors. But in fact, it is safe. The accident did not drop.

The main thing is that the reaction time is not really long enough. There is not much to see. That is what we use in HOMIPO radar. Of course, we can even integrate this HOMIPO radar. It is the integration with this image or hot photo chair.

Provide a long drive or every need. This field of security monitoring system goes inside. That's what we just mentioned. We have a CPD that detects the heartbeat of the breath. The truth about human life.

The application is not only necessary on top of the car. In fact, there are many lateral applications that can be promoted. This field is included in this medical long-term care. If the disease is cared for by a caregiver.

Even if there is a fall. We can all use this LADAR to detect. That is detected. Inform the healthcare provider immediately. In fact, we talked to the doctor about the system. He told me one thing.

They are not afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark; they are afraid of the dark.

But he did not find it; he did not find it; he did not find it; he did not find it, and he did not find it, and he did not find it, and he did not find it.

The so-called camera. The main thing is the privacy issue. Includes why the car should use LADAR. Instead of using the camera. The main thing is to take into account the privacy issue.

In addition, our detection is proactive. In addition to the use of this, we can even use the public test. Or we need to be like many elderly people.

We are the sensors of this company. Whether it is the OMIP radar, TPMS or the thermal image, etc.

Except for the car. It's like going to various markets. Well, it's the end of life right now. Whether it's the development of the industry, or the company's development. In fact, the whole operation is very positive.

That was mostly the first half of this year's whole pattern. In fact, you should ask me. Tariffs have an impact on us. Now because of July, Trump's policy can be ripped off. We will be more clear.

But now we look at it as if I'm just reporting it. In fact, it's life, because we're basically all in our business.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it must be processed in a sentence and kept the original intention intact.

First of all, I will check the transcription fragments provided and notice that each sentence has a timestamp in [time-time] format. My task is to sort these sentences in chronological order and merge them into a coherent paragraph while retaining all the content. It is important to note that some sentences may be continuous, but there is no content in the middle, such as [1758. 06-1788. 06], but there is [1788. 06-1789. 06], which may be a mistake or omission, which needs to be confirmed if it needs to be processed.

At the same time, some sentences may not be continuous in time, such as [1854. 82-1857. 06] cin merdine, which may be a name or an error, but according to the user's requirements, they must be kept in the same order. Then, I will arrange these sentences in chronological order and merge them into paragraphs. When I merge, pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences, it may need to adjust the order of sentences according to the context, but it must be arranged strictly according to the timestamp. For example, [1475. 10-1476. 50] This for us, next, [1476. 50-1478. 66] we have some supporting measures, both of which should be linked together to form a paragraph.

In addition, there are some duplicate "thank you" in the transcription provided by the user, such as [1638. 06-1640. 06] Thank you, these need to be kept in paragraphs, which may be a polite phrase at the end of the meeting. During the processing process, it is also important to note that some sentences may be wrongly split, such as [1873. 78-1874. 78] Anakin, [1874. 78-1875. 78] choo, which may be a name or an idiom, but must be retained as they are, without any modification. Finally, I will read the whole finishing paragraph transcription text to ensure that all sentences are arranged in chronological order, without omissions, and that the original intention remains unchanged.

This is part of the peak season of our business, and some of the peak season of some of the projects is also in the second half of the year. That is to say, like some of our customers, in fact, after Christmas, especially in the first season, it is easier to meet this so-called stock adjustment, because they will evaluate their stock in this period, and then do some corresponding adjustments. So many factors, about this time, probably in the second half of the year, are better than the first half.

[1818. 06-1820. 06] Thank you. [1848. 06-1849. 92] Thank you. [1854. 82-1859. 06] cin merdine. [1857. 06-1859. 78] alley. [1873. 78-1874. 78] Anakin. [1874. 78-1875. 78] choo.

[1878. 06-1880. 06] In this case, our business part is basically the FOB, so the tariff issue is not too much for us. Of course, there will be some pressure on the guests, so this part is more conservative, and everyone is waiting for Trump's last policy. So we don't have too much impact on ourselves in this part.

So, in this process, we are all negotiating this matter, we will have some different angles to talk about it. So, in fact, this part is also waiting for the final confirmation of the result. The guest here, in this part, is not much related to the relevant issue, because they know that this is actually a global issue. There is also our Taiwan, not all of our projects are going to go into this high tax rate range. [1990. 06-1992. 06] OEM products will not increase in the future, in fact, the main current OEM products are relatively large proportions in the living class, so its revenue portion is basically the OEMs.

Therefore, the distribution of OEM products in this area is very low, less than 10%, which is very high in this area of the maintenance class, because it is mainly based on the OEM market. The product portfolio, the first quarter of the product portfolio, there is a switch on the product portfolio, it is likely that Switch with us TPMS, there is a safety part, and the radar part, adding nearly 70%. The switch portion is about 34%, then the TPMS and the radar part is about 34%, which is about 20%.

That's mainly about the cost rate. In this part of the 8.1 percent, compared to 808.1% last year, there are relatively few issues. Is there anything else to look for? Well, there are some related issues in the question, I'll say it later. [214. 06-210. 06] Well, let's take a look at the future, there will be no capital increase or CB plans, and we'll look at the whole of the next capital demand and operation. That's because the CB is about to expire, so we'll first implement these stock stocks and a series of sections.

We will then look at the whole operation, then we can pay attention to our balance sheet, which should be enough funds on it. Just say that there are some investments, if necessary, we will continue to make the relevant planning. If there is a relevant plan, then we will follow the procedure and request, and then will announce. If there are no other problems, we will finish the meeting today, thank you. [2174. 06-2176. 06] Thank you.
