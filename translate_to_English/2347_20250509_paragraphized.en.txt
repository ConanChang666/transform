First of all, I would like to introduce you to the management team of United Power International. The chief executive of the meeting had Vice President Du Yi-Ju, and Director Chen. The meeting today will be presented by United Power International. The Q&A will be conducted. We will now pass the time to the management team of the company.

Thank you. Thank you. Also welcome to join us. A legal person briefing session for the first quarter of 2025 will be held. I am going to start doing a report today.

This is the first quarter of the year. Performance. That is, from the point of view of revenue. The first quarter is actually a recession, compared to the same period last year.

But basically the word is actually a recession. It's actually the first year. It's basically the third, or the third. It's the same as the third.

The first thing to look at is the performance of April. The performance of that April. I think I just announced it yesterday. The whole April is probably a growth of the two percent one y. Those kinds of products actually return to a growing trajectory. That is, in the consumer market.

The consumer's market. There is probably a recession of about 2-3 percent. At the same time, I think. In fact, the whole fourth quarter. In April, the truth is, 31 billion words. In fact, it is a high number in the past.

That's part of the commercial market. Technology solution here is about to grow. It's a 5 percent growth. Then it's the same as a new high in April.

But it is also the equivalent of a new high in April. The mobile phone has a relatively large growth. About 24 percent. We just talked about consumer here. Or a slight decline. This is probably more than 23 percent.

That is, from the point of view of the region. Probably except Hong Kong. Hong Kong still maintains a recession. The mainland is generally flat. The rest of the region is probably high single.

It is a growth of about 8-9 percent. That is, especially in Taiwan. In fact, in April, it is either commercial or mobile phone has a significant growth.

Last year in April. There were about 20 percent growth. So I wanted to say the first 4 months. The total performance reached 1225 million. The year compared to the year. It was probably the whole or more than 9 percent a recession.

Well, let's take a closer look at what we're talking about in the first quarter. A few numbers. That's the whole first quarter. The relative year of the year, of course, has declined by 12 percent. That's about 124 billion. But when we look back, we see what we're saying here on the information channel.

In fact, the commercial market still maintains a very stable growth. About nine percent of the growth. That is about 2.3 billion more years in the year. That is, the consumer market is still a bit weak.

That is probably a small recession about three percent. So this part actually comes from the amount of money. The difference is about 900 million. The mobile phone part is also a little more weak. It is probably a recession of two percent. That is about 100 million.

In IT distribution, there are actually about 2 percent of growth. The growth of 2 percent is probably about 1.3 billion. So I think the whole of the first quarter. The main thing is the semiconductor division here.

This is because the recession of 27 percent has fallen by 135 billion. So even in IT channels, there is a small growth. But the overall word is still very small. There is also a recession of about 12 percent. I think the main thing about a recession across the semiconductor side is that I think it was last year.

So the whole thing was that the semiconductor division also set a new all-time high in the first quarter of last year. It was probably around 500 494 billion. That's what I said this year. No one like last year is a boom in this type of boom. So back to a relatively normal. So it is that the entire first quarter of the whole story is almost 359 billion.

The 359 billion word is actually the only word that comes to mind when it comes to nearly five billion years of history last year. This is what we see here. One of the products in the entire category. The first word is enterprise solution. The commercial market here is the growth of nine percent. The commercial market here is almost always growing outside of Hong Kong.

That said, one of the 9% growth is mainly from the data center. The data center here has a large growth. It has a large growth. There is a large growth. There is a growth of nearly 50 percent.

But when it comes to turning back, there is a slight recession in other sectors. The main thing is this PC notebook for commercial use. There is a relatively small recession. The entire device and consumer is a consumer market. This part is probably a recession of about 3 percent.

The same word is true for every country in the region where the home market is a slight recession. So the whole commercial market seems to have a recession. On average, it looks like a slight recession in the category of various products. So what I want to see in the first quarter is that the entire consumer market is a little bit weak.

Here we see a recession of about two percent. But the mobile phone is probably divided into two parts. Part of it is a big growth. Indonesia's part of the mobile phone is a big growth. The whole growth is about 50 percent. These growth comes from the fact that Infinix is another way to move the Moto.

Moto's mobile phone. In Indonesia it is Moto's mobile phone. In Indonesia, the market is actually a lot of growth.

The following is a re-routing paragraph-by-text transcript: I'd say this is probably about 1 billion, [589. 68-592. 68] or less than 100 million. [593. 68-596. 68] The original part of the text was just mentioned, [596. 68-599. 68] I think the main word was last year, [599. 68-602. 68] last year was a new high in history, [602. 68-605. 68] and nearly 50 billion. [605. 68-607. 68] This year was actually just a re-routing to say a normal market and demand. [607. 68-614. 68] But the opposite is probably 135 billion. [614. 68. 68] But we see this chart in the first quarter, [623. 68-628. 68. 68] The results in the first quarter, [628. 68. 68] is actually quite a good thing.

[630. 68-633. 68] It's a good quarter. [633. 68-636. 68] Let's look at the whole area. [636. 68-643. 68] The whole continental area, [643. 68-647. 68] In the first quarter, it grew by 6%. [647. 68-650. 68] The 6 percent of the main words come from commercial. [650. 68-653. 68] This 6 percent of the main words come from commercial. [653. 68-656. 68]

[656. 68-658. 68] In fact, I think we can first look at the main growth unit from the mainland and Indonesia. [658. 68-665. 68] The main recession is mainly in Hong Kong. [665. 68-669. 68] But overall says that commercial growth is in fact in all regions except Hong Kong. [669. 68-674. 68] But households are in fact recession. [674. 68-677. 68] So the basic growth of the mainland is mainly in business. [677. 68-678. 68] In fact, the whole part of the commercial sector is probably about 20 billion.

[678. 68-681. 68] But the relative word in the consumer market is almost 3 billion. [681. 68-683. 68] is 3 billion. [683. 68-688. 68] Of course, the entire growth of this commercial market is mainly due to the needs of the data center. [688. 68-703. 68] The data center needs. [703. 68-704. 68] The requirements of the data center.

[706. 68-712. 68] This part of the main thing is that there are about eight percent growth here in the commercial market. [714. 68-719. 68] But the return is that there is a decline in the consumer market and there are mobile phones here. [719. 68-722. 68] I said that the two offsets are probably equal to the average. [722. 68-725. 68] Indonesia's part is actually a relatively good area. [725. 68-730. 68] This is one of the 10 percent growth that has come to this market.

[730. 68-735. 68] That is the same as the creation. [735. 68-739. 68] This is the same as a new high in the same quarter. [739. 68-745. 68] The main contribution of Indonesia's growth is also from the commercial market and the mobile phone. [745. 68-751. 68] This consumer's story is actually a recession. [751. 68-755. 68] That's especially here in pc notebook. [755. 68-760. 68] The Taiwan portion of Taiwan's word is probably a recession of five percent.

[760. 68-7764. 68] The same is true for commercial markets. [764. 68-768. 68] But the decline in mobile phones is a recession in consumer home markets. [768. 68-772. 68] So total is almost 4,5 percent. [772. 68-777. 68] It seems to be about 500 million. [777. 68-782. 68] The Hong Kong portion is a relatively large difference. [782. 68-786. 68] In fact, there is a recession in 27 commercial markets.

[786. 68-800. 68] The main difference here is that the whole business of pc notebook is software. [800. 68-806. 68] The other thing is that there is little growth like the data center here. [806. 68-810. 68] So the main recession is that there is a software like pc notebook. [810. 68-817. 68] The mobile phone just talked about a big recession because the relationship between Samsung is actually a big one. [817. 68-823. 68] The consumer part of the consumer's consumer's part is probably about 5 percent decline compared to the rest of the world. [823. 68-828. 68] The same thing is that there are about 4 to 6 percent of all kinds of products.

[828. 68-834. 68] 4 to 6 such a recession. [834. 68-838. 68] is a recession. [838. 68-842. 68] I just talked about life contact. [842. 68-846. 68] This is probably an overview of the entire operation of the region. [846. 68-851. 68] Next, I think we just look at this whole part of the economy. [851. 68-856. 68] Of course, if you want the whole first quarter of the entire performance of the whole area, there are 12 percent recessions.

[856. 68-861. 68] So the gross profit margin part is a slight increase of 0.3% compared to the same period last year. [861. 68-866. 68] But it is actually a recession due to the overall performance. [866. 68-870. 68] Or overall in the gross profit part there are about 10 percent declines. [870. 68-874. 68] The gross profit margin part is about 4.37. [874. 68-879. 68] The fee part is about 20 million more than the same period last year. [879. 68-884. 68]

[884. 68-888. 68] So we see that the whole OPEC's ratio is 2.3. [888. 68-893. 68] It is 2.3. [893. 68-897. 68] So the whole part of the operation income I wanted to say was 18.88 billion in the first quarter. [897. 68-902. 68] The ratio was 2.06. 68-906. 68.

[909. 68-914. 68] One of the 19 percent drops. [914. 68-918. 68] The JV Income here is part of our investment in the overseas counterparts. [918. 68-923. 68] The JV Income here is a substantial growth of about 20 percent. [923. 68-928. 68] The 20 percent is also an average of India, Vietnam and Thailand. [928. 68-933. 68] That is almost one growth of almost 20 percent.

[938. 68-943. 68] There is a relatively high growth in Thailand. [943. 68-949. 68] Thailand has about 30 percent of growth. [949. 68-955. 68] So overall is probably a growth of 20 percent. [955. 68-958. 68] The fees above the interest charges will be seen as a whole working capital. [958. 68-963. 68] In fact, it is also a significant decrease. [963. 68-966. 68] In fact, the fees compared to last year were also reduced by about 25 percent.

[966. 68-971. 68] So the whole PVT here is about 2.4 billion words. [971. 68-974. 68] Then about 2. 65 percent. [974. 68-978. 68] But the whole comparison compared to last year is probably like a recession of about 12 percent. [978. 68-983. 68] PAT is 18.3 billion words. [983. 68-986. 68] YY is a recession of 17 percent. [986. 68-991. 68] The PAT recession is a little higher than PPT.

[991. 68-994. 68] The main reason for this is because PAC is an income tax problem. [994. 68-998. 68] The income tax here is actually not high in the first quarter income tax. [998. 68-1002. 68] Instead, it is because of other reasons for the first quarter last year. [1002. 68-1006. 68] In fact, the relative word is because of its relatively low tax rate in the first quarter of last year. [1006 68-1010. 68] So this year's TAG goes back to a general. [1010. 68-1014. 68] But this side still affects our entire PAT.

[1014. 68-1018. 68] So the statement of US stocks earnings in the first quarter of this year is 1. [1018. 68-1022. 68] is 1. 1 This is the case. [1022. 68-1025. 68] So this statement is probably one of our all-time reports. [1025. 68-1030. 68] Then again, we see that the whole working capital just talked about the whole working capital in the first quarter is almost 760 billion. [1030. 68-1034. 68] This statement is not very sure if it is a historical low. [1034. 68-1038. 68] But in fact, we see that the last three years is very low.

[1038. 68-1042. 68] A relatively low number. [1042. 68-1046. 68]

That's what we see here, and that's less than 40 billion. That's what I see here. That's why I think the main reason is because the first season is actually the performance is relative, the decline is more. But actually, a working capital has been reduced to more than 761,761. That's what I think in the Banch case, where I think it's supposed to look like, followed, and compared with the last quarter, it should be quite stable.

In fact, all of these indicators, although in fact, it is all these numbers, whether it is that we revenue gp, then, etc., this opi and so on. Although it looks like it is not anything special, but in fact, all of these numbers are in the future, and in the future, it should be about the fifth, the fourth, or the fifth, not the new or the high, etc., but at least, although there is nothing special, but basically, I want to say that the whole word should be either, but only sound, relatively good or not good, it is not good, but not very good.

I want to say that in this report section of the performance, that I want the whole, basically we are a low risk industry, then I think we follow the entire government requirements of a norm, then we have done it this year, to say that the entire parent company of all the checks, then next year will be combined with this, subsidiary investment company, etc., an inventory, then we have also set that we are a carbon reduction goal in 2030, then I will very quickly follow you, said that this whole idea in the first quarter of the operating situation, Sensei, sure I am very pleased to give you understanding, but do not want to, when to go back to Rose, bring it to behavioral, yes, we have done random criticism, Mentor somose, van, thank you, how, if we look at it, this is not biological.
