<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will check through the provided verbatim to pay attention to the sentences corresponding to each timestamp. In the example given by the user, some sentences may be duplicated or loose, for example, "that new material business is particularly new to this Southeast Asia market" appears twice, need to confirm whether it is really duplicated, or the error when the user enters it. If it is duplicated, it may be necessary to keep it because the user requests not to delete anything. Next, I need to combine these verbatim entries into a consistent paragraph. This needs to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or paragraph.

Each topic may require a separate segment, but it is important to ensure that the connection between sentences is natural while not changing the original intention. At the same time, pay attention to the processing of timestamps. Examples of users, timestamps are included in square brackets, but do they need to retain timestamps in the final paragraph verb? Depending on the user's requirements, it may not be necessary because the user wants a readable paragraph rather than a sentence timestamp.

In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the oral expressions, such as words such as "that", "oh", etc., which may need to be adjusted appropriately in the formal paragraphs, but the user expressly requests not to change anything, so these words must be retained. For example, "that" in the "first" section of the present-day officer" needs to be retained, although it may be less common in the written language. In the process, it is also necessary to check if there are duplicate or redundant information. For example, the introduction of the Malaysian market appears twice, but may need to be merged, but according to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so it must be retained twice. This may affect the smoothness of the paragraph, but must follow the user's instructions.

For example, some sentences start with "that" and may need to adjust the sequence or merge, but the same can not change the original sentence. For example, "that future is what we want more aggressively" and "like Europe set up a base" may need to be merged into a sentence, but the structure of the original sentence must be maintained. Finally, after the conversion, it is necessary to read through the entire paragraph script to ensure that there is no omission of any original sentences and the transition between paragraphs is natural. At the same time, check for formatting errors, such as whether the punctuation marks are correct and whether the paragraphs are rationally separated. In summary, the process steps include: 1. Read and understand the content in a sentence; 2. Identify the subject and paragraph structure; 3. Combine related sentences, maintain originality and integrity; 4. Remove timestamps, adjust the format; 5. Check coherity and correctness.

Make sure that every step of the way is in line with the requirements of the user, without deleting, changing, or enclosing any content. </think> The advanced members of the parliament are all welcome. The visit of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of International Investment Holdings Co., Ltd. is now open.

The second is the general manager of Cai Xiaode. That third is the spokesperson of Hong Jiamin. Now there is a spokesperson to share with you the company's operation and development prospects. There is a spokesperson thank you.

Thank you for joining us today. Today we are going to simply take a look at some of the first-half operational performance. If there are any questions, welcome to come back again. The disclaimer section. Please come back again. Next is the contents of one of the three main sections of this presentation today.

The company was founded in 1992. It is the 33rd anniversary of the company. The latest capital is 11.03 billion. Our main products are divided into these four categories. Environmentally durable materials Environmentally durable materials Carbon fiber composites and circular economy materials are the four main elements.

Our four products are transported by three major businesses: Carbon Fiber Composites and Filter Energy. These three businesses have their own locations in Taiwan and mainland China. The new material business is particularly in this Southeast Asian market. The new material business is particularly in this Southeast Asian market.

This Malaysia has a production facility. One of the places that can be sold directly is the location. The other is the filter energy business. It is the first in our group to go to Europe. There is a R&D center in the Netherlands and a technology center in the Netherlands.

It is a better chance to work with the local. That is just one of the purposes for which we operate. But it is said that we start with our company. We have set up our own brand.

It has its own brand. And it is not limited to selling in the so-called Asian region. Our products are early beginning to go international. It is already a division of five continents. That future we are more active in the hope of others.

This has always been a medium-term plan for us. We all have this factory. Our design is basically all of the four products mentioned above. There are basically two production locations to supply. This piece is for customers.

This arrangement can be a more stable supply for the customer. There are no broken chains. Or some programs that can not be adjusted flexibly. The future is just as mentioned. We do not rule out this European America's aggressive expansion point. To serve our customers.

Next, we see the competitive advantage of the company. Over the years, we have launched an innovative product. It is the batch of laws that we want to solve. This material has been invented. We have almost no way to recover such a problem. So we have proposed an innovative material EasyCycle.

Finally, it can be combined with this Clever to degrade the recycling. Our material is not just an experimental product. Not only is it commercialized in the laboratory. The application of commercialization is the first in our planning. There is already a batch of sales in the wind power industry in this industry.

We have also received an international certification body to prove it. ISO14067 has proven to be our product. This carbon reduction effect has reached 42% compared to the new material remanufactured. Next, we will report some progress towards sustainability ESG. As mentioned earlier, our products have already been commercialized.

And that can be the result of carbon reduction. So if we put the relevant shipping. We made a simple conversion. We helped our customers to provide green materials to help customers achieve carbon reduction of up to 12,000 metric tons.

It was also a very good feedback. We wanted to tell you about it again. We are here this month in addition to our previous awards. We also have a special exhibition with this local artist.

This is a collection of works by local artists on display, including calligraphy ink and carving. Our innovation park is open to everyone on Saturday. There are local small farmers who provide this coffee. That and some. It is a series of works of art exhibited on a regular basis.

If you are looking for a place to stay in the South, then we have created a place for you to enjoy your stay.

The first thing to see is the operation of 24 years. 24 years compared to 23 years. I think it is obvious before the business experience. Whether it is in the growth of revenue.

This part of the gross profit margin and business experience is very good. There is a very good performance. That to this part of the business out-of-pocket income. It appears that there are some differences compared to last year. That's the difference. Let me just tell you a simple explanation.

23 years ago. We had a business with an offshore factory earlier. Of course, there were some adjustments to the company's strategy in the future. Also sold this share. So before 23 years ago, it was an irregular year.

We have identified a portion of the equity proceeds of this business outside the business. That is not a return after 24 years. So this part is a more significant difference. That's another. In 24 years. We also focus on the affiliate that invests through subsidiary new materials.

This is because it is a new investment in capacity. Some fixed assets are invested, etc., and there is no way to continue to get approval from local government for some business licenses. So some capacity is not open.

Some of the company's losses are business losses. That's a more prudent assessment. We've started investing for 24 years. We've made a positive impression on one of these investments. Therefore, the corresponding losses are also recognized outside the 24 years industry.

That's a big difference between 24 and 23 years. That's the end. I think if we make this part of the profit, it's a one-time one-off.

In fact, 24 years of overall operating performance is better than 23 years. Then see the first quarter operating conditions. A year. Four quarters of this case. Usually. In the first quarter, we are a relatively low cycle of a low quarter.

The main reason for this is that Spring Festival is due in the first quarter. That is a relatively small number of days. Revenue is usually the lowest in our four quarters. So, in the subsequent analysis, we pay more attention to a situation in QOQ. Revenue in the first quarter is up to 19.6 billion. Compared to the same period last year.

YY has also increased by about 13 percent. That's in the gross profit and the net profit in the spare parts of the business. There's not much difference compared to the same period last year.

The following is a transcription of the rescheduled paragraphs:. The pressure is the same. The difference happens in this part of the out-of-business revenue. This situation is similar to what I have seen in the last 24 years. This includes the loss of an investment company. And, of course, the main period is the same period.

This year, I think the appreciation of the US dollar has begun to converge. It's not like there's a good spread in the past. So in this part of the business outside the profit, the exchange benefit has also been affected. Overall, EPS came to 0.48. In other words, I don't think there's much difference compared to the same period last year.

In the first quarter of this year, the share of environmental durable materials accounted for 37. 2% of revenue, and the YY decreased by about 0.6%. The second quarter saw that the green energy materials was 29. 4%, compared to the same period last year YY decreased by nearly 7.6%. Then the carbon monitoring component was 3. 6%, and the YY was about 2.1%.

I think we should all know that the contribution to this circular economy material is a development focus of years. This is also true under our efforts, starting from the application of the first industrial wind power industry we planned to ferment. Since the fourth quarter of last year, there has been a formal production of this shipment. Therefore, this part of the international customers, there is a corresponding value in the regular value of this green energy material, the green energy material is transferred to the circular economy material.

This is the part where we do not rule out the fact that there is a growing demand for green energy materials in the wind power industry this year. This part of us does not rule out the fact that we have seen some growth in the industry this year. This part is also what we see, after all, we are upstream material manufacturers.

If the downstream industry develops better, we will also be actively doing some layout and arrangement. Then there is a sales analysis of 100 products. From the left side, you can see that it is eco-friendly and durable materials, and YOY's sales have increased by 12%. This part, of course, comes from our stable mainland market, and the international market has also slightly broken.

This is also what I said before, it should be combined with circular economy materials, let's do this comparison, that's not too much difference, maybe even growth, is the growth of sales. Next to see the left part of the carbon fiber material, the sales part is obviously some growth, growth is about 27%. That's why we're going to tell you a lot more about this, segmented market, international market sales increased by 91%. That's what we've been talking about for a long time, we've found a new international customer.

This is the demand for our current sales. Then here in Taiwan, the supply of the Taiwanese factory is slightly reduced compared to the same period last year, and it has been reduced by about 38%. So I think this is the object we deliver from Tiantian. Since the second half of last year, some of them are an adjustment of their operations, and everyone should know a little bit.

This is the first stage of the supply demand for this offshore plant in Taiwan, which is now a paragraph. After that, we are very active in cooperation, more terminal customers, is the international customer, the demand for this new industry type of sheet for the international market, is our current factory in Taiwan, very active in the verification of new materials of this cooperation process. According to my terminal customers, there is no change.

I'd like to see a figure from the end of the first quarter of March, with some significant reductions in cash. This is actually just a piece of money that we've spent on making a deposit, so the subject will be listed on our other moving assets. In principle, working capital is not too much of a change or impact. What follows is that there is a slight decrease compared to the beginning of this year. This part is also true, we just said that the first quarter's revenue is a relatively small quarter, so this part of the collection will also have some impact.

This is actually the fourth quarter of last year, we saw our suppliers a little through the production schedule, there is a trend in raising prices. So we made a strategic spare stock. The following is also in our operation, the process has been decomposed, so the growth of the stock is not an abnormal state. Next we see the real estate plant and equipment, this subject, has obviously increased by about 200 million, compared to the first quarter.

Then the county government also came out of this Kirin land and sold it. Of course, it was the first time to buy it. I hope that this has a more complete factory, which can later make some better operational planning. This is the part of our real estate.

One reason for the increase. What is the part of the debt? There is no obvious difference in the data to explain to you verbally. There is only one thing, the part of the current debt, adding about 100 million more than the beginning of the year, but I think this is also a good situation.

That's why we're helping our cash week shifts. That's the part of that important financial indicator, and that's how it looks like it's going to decrease the number of days we've received, but in fact, the total number of days we've received is about the same as last year, it's probably 160 days, not very unusual. That's a statement for the year and the first quarter of our operation.

In fact, in 2024, the amount of direct sales of our company in the U.S. was less than a percentage of the company's overall revenue, so the overall impact was limited. In fact, in the case of indirect impact, we came from our direct customers and customers, this part is relatively unclear, but we also received a more specific response at the end that our supply chain is affected by U.S. tariffs, so this part is still under constant observation. In order to address the impact of U.S. tariffs, our company has a lot of factories, which are distributed in three continents, one in Taiwan, and one in Malaysia.

In fact, in the Chinese market, since China is actually the largest country in the wind power sector, the demand for the whole year from last year is about 80GW, and this year is expected to exceed 100GW. In the international market, even under the premise of Trump's non-green policy, some of the world's international markets are still growing.

The first part of the environmental durability material, the first part of the mainland China is still stable growth, which is based on some basic annual demand for stability, which is said to be based on the growth of China's mainland China, under the premise that we have a market share in mainland China this year is still stable growth, which is mainly as we just said, we will strive for more market share to increase this part of the profit source. Then again, it is the part of the international market, this part of the year is a very large growth, mainly because we have been working hard in some areas, such as North Africa, Europe, etc. These areas in the last few years, we also see that this year in the market environment durability part is a very large growth, and that the whole product is expected to be close to double-digit growth.

In addition to our existing European customers, the part of the international green energy is still stable growth, and the biggest source of growth this year will be in the Indian region. In the case of India, based on the Government of India in 2030 has a green energy policy under the guidance of a policy, in fact, some of the installed equipment in the Indian region in these three years is actually the fastest growing in the international market, so this part is one of the biggest revenue contribution this year. The third is that in the carbon fiber composite part, we think that this year compared to the same time last year, this year will be a slight decrease.

This is mainly due to our international customers. He has a number of large-size night lines with a new one. So if this part of the area in Taiwan, we expect this year to be at one stage of the certification. So this part, the carbon fiber composites in Taiwan will be less than the overall production this year.

This part of the order is, in fact, through the customer's certification to us, that they are very aware of our ability and our ability. In fact, they are very aware of our ability and our ability, and some of the configurations provided by some of the plants. So in this part, we have grown four times more in terms of our ability and our ability, compared to the total order volume of the previous year.

But this is also a direction for our continued efforts this year and next year as a whole. In addition to the low-air economy, the relatively new development is that it also leaps out of the field of low-industry economy and wind power, and we gradually receive some robot-related applications.

This year, we will continue to improve the quality of the recycled material, and we will continue to improve the quality of the recycled material. In fact, even before the machine is turned off, we have received a number of other international customers who are willing to gradually certify our recycling quality (this phrase is repeated twice), so this part of the story is very positive in the future. In addition to just saying that it is as we mentioned earlier this year, one of the partners of India's recycling wind farm said in the press release, we will be active in this year, and we expect that this big customer will change from the mainland to the traditional quality to the recycling quality.

In particular, we originally expected that verification would take a long time, but in fact, we have shipped in small batches so far this year. That part of it is in addition to the end of the year, we hope to be able to verify it, and we want to get some of the customer's licenses. After obtaining the license, we expect to start as soon as possible next year, and in the electronic material part can compare some of the bulk of the shipment.

Good. Bad management, that is, I would like to ask you first because we just mentioned our outlook, just mentioned four product categories, only the part of NICE said that this high-digit growth. That growth performance for other products can't be explained a little bit more? Bad I just didn't repeat it.

We are now looking forward to an upgrade, but that is to say, our ambition is good. The green energy part is relatively optimistic, which is the same as last year's spell would say is double-digit growth. The slightly lower part of the carbon fiber is still to take into account the number of our overall certification (this phrase repeats three times), that in the circular economy material, last year's revenue is about 2%, and this year's goal is 5% to 8% of the ratio, the above explanation.

Is there any preliminary view on the policy of the 15th China government's renewable energy policy? Thank you. In fact, this year, the entire Supply Chain of mainland Chinese fans.

This year, we believe that the amount and the gross profit in the second quarter of this year, there should be some difference between the two parts, and will not come back. We think that the amount and the amount of the gross profit in the second quarter should be better, I really don't have any problem with the amount, the material, but from now on, the basic value of the raw material is relatively low, because some economic conditions of the mainland, and not come back very soon, this is a supplemental explanation.

In the future, we will continue to focus on the future, and we will continue to focus on the future. In the future, we will continue to focus on the future, and we will continue to focus on the future. In the future, we will continue to focus on the future, and we will continue to focus on the future. In the future, we will continue to focus on the future, and we will continue to focus on the future. In the future, we will continue to focus on the future, we will continue to focus on the future, and we will continue to focus on the future. Well, do you want to answer, okay, please, in fact, everyone, I'm talking about wind power this piece, wind power this piece, in the past, because that, although they are a lot of them, that's the country, but they have been around with tenders in the past, I see almost four and five years, every tender, that's all that, every MW of the price is the rise and fall, that's until last year, about the third quarter, then stop, then the fourth quarter, then so far, look at their prices are a bit up, that's this is, in fact, the whole price, it's a very good phenomenon, not every MW, but in fact, that they's the capacity, the more you see it, the cost of each MW, as the bigger as the fans do, they assume all the price is consistent, it is the original price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the MW, it is the price, it is the price, so it is the price, it is from the price, so it is that they start of the price, so they start the whole, it is the whole, it is the whole, the price, the whole, it is the price, the whole, it is that they sells, the whole, it is the price, it is the whole, the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, the price, the whole, it is the price, it is the price, it is that they sells, it is the price, it is not, it is the price, it is the price, it is the whole, it is not, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is not, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is only, it is not, it is, it is the price, it is the price, it is the price, it is not, it is the price, it is the price,

The house of the Lord shall be called the house of the Lord, and the house of the LORD shall be called the house of the LORD; and the house of the LORD shall be called the house of the LORD; and the house of the LORD shall be called the house of the LORD.

They are the ones who will be able to see the light of day, and they will be able to see the light of day, and they will be able to see the light of day, and they will be able to see the light of day, and they will be able to see the light of day.

Is the investment. 9. 5 should be 9. 5. At that time the fan. Length is 85. Now the fan is at least 1. For example, 112.

So the plant. The original design of the plant is. It is very difficult to use it. So under this situation, you can apply it.

The garden is like a garden, and the garden is like a garden, and the garden is like a garden, and the garden is like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden, like a garden with a garden, like a garden, like a garden with a garden, like a garden with a garden, like a garden with a garden.

We do not have any tags for We Are One [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics. [Stereo] lyrics.

In this high. In the past, under a highly competitive situation. In fact, investors also want to say. I really want to be like a mold, and then it can be produced three years ago.

Now the production is one year, or one of my factories. It used to be five years ago. It can only be two to three years now. So naturally, there is someone. There is no investment in this process.

So the whole supply. The business is relatively small, but it is much smaller. The price will go up. I think that's a big factor.

Ask them about it, and they will tell us about it, and we will tell you about it, and we will tell you about it, or we will tell you about it, and we will tell you about it.

Our factory was repaired without knowing it. We. The last company. The factory is basically. We don't have the so-called new cover. But because it is produced with it.

For example, I just said it. You produce 85 meters. Now you produce 112 meters. This book, for example, is a skycar. Or the length of that mold.

The more you do, the more you will be able to do it, and the more you will be able to do it, the more you will be able to do it, and the more you will be able to do it.

It may take 10 years. At this stage, because it does. It only takes 5 years. It has the same situation. Because it size is also big. That is, we have some materials.

This is a semi-finished product. This semi-finished product is a semi-finished product, so it is also our size.

Our size. Not much bigger. But the space needed to produce. Must be bigger. The second question I would like to ask.

It's just the general manager. It seems to be mentioned. Last year, 2%. This year, 5% to 8%. But because of that new door. Is it the first quarter finished?

And then the third time, so the question is, so this year's new door, there will be no new phone, if I just said it, that is us.

There is a trend in the UK. It is the first time the shipment is completed. It is in the whole of Europe. In fact, there are a lot of customers. Especially, there are a lot of trends.

We are also considering whether to use recyclable, so we are still actively fighting for this part. There are more recyclable trends this year, so this is not possible.

If you do not have an account with us, or if you do not have an account with us, or if you have an account with us, you may not be able to log in to your account.

If it's early this year, it's a chance to lead this year. Basically, it's certification. We're all straight to some.

It is like a new door. Vesta DPI such as this, so whether they are provided with a downstream trend, the developers will provide them with a quote.

It's up to the developer to decide which blade to use. We've all passed the certification. It's just a matter of whether the developer wants to use it.

I'll add. We can recycle what we're using right now. Siemens has a Sofia factory. That's like a total of 45. 45 seats. That should just say that the third quarter should be hanged.

We have two of them, one of them is the one we have before, and the other is the one we have before, and the other is the one we have before, and the other is the one we have before us.

Another is the system of time profile. The time profile is. It is the system of power. That is, we are the two systems.

Hanging. Just say. Less amount. Testing. As for the two. The manufacturer of Li Anfeng Electric in Taiwan.

"I think that's what it's all about," he said, "and that's what the two of us are all about, and that's what we're all about.

Of course this one. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
