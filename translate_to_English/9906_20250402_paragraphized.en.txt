<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user-provided transcription and convert it into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I need to read the user-provided rules and examples carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed with any original word, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I will check the content of the transcription provided and note that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences.

For example, a few sentences at the beginning are the host questions, followed by a general response. The same speaker needs to be combined into a paragraph, while a line divides between different speakers. At the same time, pay attention to the order of timestamps to ensure the correct time flow of the paragraph. During the process, you may encounter some spoken expressions or duplicated content, such as "can you understand Taiwanese?" sentences that need to be kept as it were.

In addition, some sentences may contain vacancy in timestamps, such as [202. 00-203.00] OK, here you need to check if they belong to the same paragraph, which may require separate paragraphs. You also need to pay attention to the use of punctuation marks to ensure that the end of each sentence and the separation of the paragraphs is correct. For example, when a speaker ends a conversation, the next speaker should start with a line separator. At the same time, keeping the original timestamp, but the user may not need to show timestamps in the final output, so you need to confirm whether or not to keep them.

In addition, some sentences may contain multiple clauses that need to determine whether or not to merge or separate. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read the entire paragraph verbatim to check if all the sentences are correctly arranged, with no omissions or errors, and to ensure that all the requirements of the user, in particular, do not delete, do not rewrite anything.

First of all, we would like to ask the two experts to say that TSMC has announced that it has invested billions of dollars in the U.S.A. Many people think that TSMC is bound to affect the mid-south price that was hit by TSMC's plant theme. What do you want to ask the experts?

I think the media report is very much, and I think if I look at it from my point of view, I think I'll probably take a few points to classify it. The first is the main focus of this research and development, in Taiwan about a thousand years in the United States. The main focus of the research and development is to measure the future of this so-called fog, and the length of its wafers, where the part of the future of this high-level extension process will continue. It is obvious that Taiwan and the United States.

Taiwan is a country that has a strong shield, and our cutting-edge technology is the development process that we must rely on all over the world. Therefore, I think it will be a relatively empty issue for investment that is just a general business behavior, and mainly for the so-called customers in the United States to invest in this so-called investment. So basically for some real estate investment that used to be the subject of TSMC, will it have any impact? I personally think it is not at all, and should expect that, for example, such as our five factories in Kaohsiung, we will have the opportunity to start mass production by the end of the year.

This is one of my personal observations. Well, we thank the two experts, which means that although the president of TSMC may have impacted this short-term market volatility last year, the collapse of the technology industry in the south has now been formed, so there will be more vendors in the future, and in the long run, this is a positive way to see this in the south.

We are now in the process of launching the third port of Kaohsiung. At the time, Mr. Wu was the mayor, and his former vice president, Mr. Wu, was in the process of serving as the mayor of Kaohsiung City, and he had to have two bases. He had to have one file, one day rain, one file, and one file. The airport should have to have a lot of government and public representative efforts, so Kaohsiung will continue to add 15 different destinations this year to the end of the year. If it should be assumed that the road is correct, I am afraid that this will have a chance to fly to the United States by the end of the year.

If you are looking for something that is not the best for you, you may be looking for something that is not the best for you. If you are looking for something that is not the best for you, you may be looking for something that is not the best for you. If you are looking for something that is not the best for you, you may be looking for something that is not the best for you. If you are looking for something that is not the best for you, you may be looking for something that is not the best for you, but if you are looking for something that is the best for you, you may be looking for something that is the best for you.

The most of the MRT lines are Kaohsiung, because there are not many people in Taichung. I said what the meaning of the present, so Kaohsiung does not have too many people. It will extend to what area in the future, and you can see clearly why the whole factory of TSMC seems to be biased toward the south and south. The first land acquisition, in fact, is mainly electricity. Why? Because the north is not powerless, we are here to send north and south, so sometimes people can say that like the Chief Financial Officer, they should know that the electric pole at H Hall before they landed it underground. Many people don't understand how to say that this former president of Su, you are from Pingtung, so go there won't be able to submerge the electric pole, no help, no help, he was at that time, when he was a river plant, electric to Taipei, or every time a typhoon pole fell down.

So sometimes we look at the policy face, as a real estate, we look at the policy face, so when we look at the people in the face, we want to see it together. So Kaohsiung has such a good benchmark, want to open the route, mainly we have to be public, mainly there are engineers to be easy to come back, mainly they are convenient to help them, but of course, they are not like every day to those engineers, so the relative population will be close to the official, so I think the whole area of the future will be more obvious, I think it should be in Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, in the future, three blocks, his relative bases are relatively low.

If you want to buy a car, you need to go shopping, you need to go shopping, then you need to go shopping, then it will be medical needs, etc., so this is a logical concept of the region. If you ask my personal opinion, of course, I will say that the future with TSMC, Taiwan's accumulation industry has the biggest impact, must be Tainan, Tainan, Tainan, Kaohsiung, A.A., early, you will say that Kaohsiung is not like Tainan, a wave, A.A., A.A., A.T., South Taiwan has a lot of maturity, A. It will not be better, if you want to buy a car, A.T.M.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T

Here is a re-routing paragraph transcript: So real estate is looking at it every cycle for 10 years. A cycle is growing more and more than a cycle. TSMC is an issue, and it will have more issues in the future. These issues may also be expected that you can follow up with their report analysis. Here are some of my personal opinions.

Thank you. We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for sharing your thoughts. That is, in the next five years, Kaohsiung and Pingtung, because of the initiation of the technology industry, there is a good potential for this investment. On the contrary, this trade park in Shuinan, Taichung, because of the recent price soaring, and this supply and demand imbalance.

That's too high or the area that lacks the support of the same rigidity needs. The opposite is the greater risk. Well, next, I'd like to ask the next question, that is, in the case of the government's launch of this tightened housing market, this year's price drop.

It should be said for this year's target, because the real estate it is going to say a cycle is 10 years. So everyone's real estate is now acquiring and selling the house from the previous land, and it's about 4 years ago. Now it's about 6 years old. This is because the duration is longer because the lack of work. Because the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has just come out of the spotlight. So the construction cost has gone beyond everyone's imagination.

So, when he was in the middle of the night before, he was in the middle of the night, and when he was in the middle of the night, he was in the middle of the night, and when he was in the middle of the night, he was in the middle of the night, and when he was in the middle of the night, he was in the middle of the night, and when he was in the middle of the night, he was in the middle of the night, and when he was in the middle of the night, he was in the middle of the night.

I think the policy is different in addition to some perspective, but will follow the trend. Because in principle, the per capita households in Taiwan before 2000 were about 3 people in a household. It is also necessary to correct how fast it was about 4 to 5 billion people in 1970 when I was about to say that my numbers didn't work. But I think it was about 2. 12 people. So what does it mean?

You're getting older and better. That's why I think a 4 million man is also in the card's $2 million logic that he probably will reduce his number of homes with your family. So sometimes we do this in this industry to push big data to look at it. Just like a few of the experts in our people's documents you've told him from the time you look at the big data. So we're saying that by keeping 23.4 billion people around to the present, it's also more than 23 million. Our number of households has been increasing.

We have been living in Taiwan for 20 years. If a child has a college job on his own, he will have to go home. He will continue to learn. Just like my two daughters, he has become a three-family home. He has become a three-family owner. He has been a three-family owner. So maybe a year later, if my child is married, I think my mom is going to be so small that I can be more comfortable.

I don't have a lot of pressure. So I don't know how to call him a commodity room in China, which means that he's not a long-term product as long as your time is like the earliest car out of our riding, called the hardware one, Taiwan big brother, then began to wait for the smaller machine to ride out more recently, the principle is that the bigger the plane, the bigger the plane is 6. 5 inches, and the more people ride the tablet.

If you are looking for a place to buy two rooms, you may not be able to buy two rooms, like three rooms, have a master education, master bedroom concept. Eight years ago we retired, when we first set up, the market reaction was not good, said that we want to try, we think, we hypothesized, the result, assuming you have to find out how, six years ago, all the markets have changed like this, we said, we have met, we have met. In addition, the size of your balcony, to put down enough, I said that you have this part of your savings, although it does not have a price, but frankly, we are here, if there are more than three years, even a little longer than I rent, so they will have to rent something, we have to rent, we have to rent, but we have to rent something we have to rent, but it, but it is also want to do, it, it, it, it, it, and it, it is a new, it, it, and it, it is a new, I want, I want to do, it, it, it, it, I want to do it, I want to do it, I want to do it, it, it, it, I want to do it, I want to do it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, I want to do it, it, it, it, it, it, I want to do it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, If you want to buy a property, you can buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property, you need to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. If you want to buy a property. This is a different concept, we all think of earthquakes, buildings are dangerous, in fact, more dangerous through the day, a long long earthquake, the building looks like it exploded a few times, the building is very good.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided transcription fragments and convert them into paragraph-provided transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it must be preserved in a sentence, while organizing them into a consistent paragraph.

First of all, I will check the transcription content provided to see if there is a clear segmentation point. For example, the transition between different topics or speakers in the conversation may need to be segmented. But according to the example provided by the user, it seems that the entire content is the same person's speech, so it may need to be segmented according to logic or timestamp. Next, I will analyze each timestamp corresponding content in a sentence to determine how to combine them into naturally smooth paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may belong to the same topic, should be put together, and some may belong to different parts, which need to be handled separately. For example, discussion about "through the sky" and "building" may be a paragraph, while the "commercial real estate" part is another paragraph.

In addition, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp and ensure that the sentence is arranged in the correct sequence of time. During the processing process, some oral expressions or repeated sentences such as "so probably we will do this in this piece of adjustment" need to remain as if they were, without any modification. At the same time, pay attention to the correct use of punctuation marks to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural. Finally, I will read the passage-by-text text of the whole transition to check whether the user has met all the requirements: no reduction of any content, keeping the original sequence, paragraphs reasonable, and language fluctuating.

In short, the process needs to be carefully handled, logical segmentation, and strictly adhere to the user's requirements to ensure that the final result is accurate and easy to read. </think> [paragraph transcription]:. Through the sky is frozen, through the sky has fallen, that is not added, it just failed. But the screen of the building is more refreshing, to have a factory high, life stall, more spectacular, so the building is upside down. In fact, it is because of its many of this pattern to be modified, so let's go back to it, so now, we'll see, we'll do some corrections and revisions in this product force.

We also want to say that in the stage of pre-sale purchase, it is in the payment, we also want to be a pragmatic attitude, not in the clever, you think we don't want to do this, because the rise is good. If it is calm, it won't be nervous. I think it is necessary to tell the consumers clearly, so we will probably do this adjustment in this section. Thank you for your attention. I just want to point out the problem, that is to face the tightening cycle of this year's housing market, so next next question is that Taiwan's economy benefited from the boom of AI, strong performance, so is there a higher investment opportunity for commercial real estate in relation to this residential market?

But you ask me if the future of commercial heritage will not flourish because of the overall objective factors of the Lord? I think that I will, I am responsible, very honest, because we do not talk about the north, so if you are in Taichung, whether it is south of Tainan or the countryside, you can find the so-called office building commercial space, the smallest one I just said, in 1995, then you like our own office not a few Zhongshan buildings, Minghuan Building, it was 2000 years ago, you came out of the office building is about two thousand years, so this bottle is more than twenty years, it will have a vacuum for more than a long time, we will have a lot of deficiencies, plus the adjustment of the industrial structure. I think it needs to be OK, but it needs to be old, so we don't want to buy the office anymore, so we don't want to start a headquarters like them, you can't, like we ourselves are looking for the head to find, it's difficult to find, you can't do it if you don't think of this point earlier, so I think Shandong real estate is a future Kaohsiung, we're in the south to face an investment option, and then add the current central bank's policy is to control regardless of whether it's in Taipei, that's who's here, here, where the geographical goods six, we all say Shandong real estate can't do it, it's not limited, Shandong real estate benefits are what you want to do, and it's not wait for Aff, it's like it's the 24 hours of this machinery department, so it's not limited, so there's time, so there's not the inside because there's no change it's no change, because there's no change, it's not because there's no change, it's the problem, it's the public, it's a lot, it's a new industry, it's a new office, it's a lot more than, it's a new industry, it's a new office, it's a lot, but what?

If you are looking for a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place where you can find a place. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home. In Taiwan, there is a lot of electricity to drive home.

This is the reason why my brother and my brother are working in the park. 20 years ago we all talked about why real estate is slow, but it really is 21 years ago when Taiwan's scientific and technological achievements in the peninsula of the revolution, too much money, too much money to buy a house, the situation is too much, I just said that the price of the house in Zhubei has been shortened, and the price of the house in Kaohsiung has been so fierce, it is mainly this factor, so it has become what the southern real estate compares to the stock market in the way, so don't use the traditional model to assess when the factory will have a lot of meaning.
