First of all, I would like to welcome you to the first session of the first year of our lily in Taiwan. First of all, I would like to invite you to join us for the first half of the year, because after a week of vacation, I would like to wish you a Happy New Year, and I would like you to have a great 12 years of good luck.

I directly talked about a production base of our company, at present, Lily Group, in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, we have set up a factory, the main area of the factory, is for the needs of our various brands customers, because, no matter any brand wants to be close to the unloading plant, to us to do a product supply. For example, the early Chinese mainland did not need to say, many people in 90 years to set up the factory, that Vietnam part, lily we were in 1998 when we set up, the Indonesia part is also around 2010, according to the requirements of the brand, whether it is a US brand or a German brand, we all asked, we also recently serve some customers in the local area, so what is the situation, all the brand customers demand the third country of production, that lily already has five places, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, China, China, China, four countries one production place, then then

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim content provided. It looks like a presentation or report about the company's financial and business performance, involving revenue, product categories, brand growth, etc.

First of all, I will check every entry in a sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or errors. For example, the first entry that the user has provided is "[532. 58-537. 58] is not very different because the real estate amount of the property in 2024 is only 78 million," and I need to remove the timestamp to keep the sentence content. Then, I need to combine these sentences into paragraphs in logical order, which may need to be grouped according to the subject matter, such as the regional revenue ratio, then the product category, then the brand growth situation, etc. It should be noted that some sentences may be logically in the same paragraph, such as the comparison of Vietnamese lilies and Taiwanese lilies, or about the production of Phnom Penh mesh.

In addition, some sentences may contain duplicate or need to be connected, such as about the production of Phnom Penh meshes, users often mention the production of Dongguan and Vietnam, need to integrate this information into the same paragraph to ensure smooth. At the same time, pay attention to the correct representation of the numbers and percentages, such as "47.2%", "48.7%", etc., to ensure that the data is accurate. In handling the brand section, the user detailed list of the revenue and growth rate of each brand, the need to segment the information by brand, each brand separately, but maintain the order of the original sentence. For example, German brands, American brands, On Running, New Balance, etc., each brand information needs to be presented consistently, while paying attention to the user mentioned growth percentages and the analysis of reasons.

At the same time, check for missing sentences or wrong combinations to ensure that all content is properly converted. In summary, I need to process, identify logical groupings, merge related sentences, keep originality and data accurate, and follow all the instructions of the user without any deletion or rewriting. This requires careful reading and checking multiple times to ensure that the final results meet the user's requirements.

In fact, it is a merger of two plants, and there are Dongguan plant and Wu Xi plant. So I just said that Vietnam lily is the largest single subsidiary, which accounts for 29%. Well, it has two plants merged together 45%, the largest is 29% of Vietnam lily, then 15% of Taiwan lily, Indonesia currently has 9% in 2024 and 2% in North America.

But it was 48.7% in 2023. Why? Why is it low profile? Phnom Penh mesh, right? A proportion of Phnom Penh mesh, it ranges from 11. 2% in 2022 to 3.4% in 2023, which is now the last year of 2024, 16% in fact it is growing and has been growing.

The present Vietnam baihong is a supply dedicated to Phnom Penh mesh, of course, in Dongguan also produced Phnom Penh mesh, the proportion of Dongguan is about 20% of the supply of a Phnom Penh mesh. Well, this is to tell you, this is the worst year in 2023 has actually passed. That is to say, we have seen from this page in 2016, from 2016 to now we have never been so bad as a profit figure in 2023. That is of course, this year in 2024, a byte of the whole year, in fact, we announced in mid-January, the byte of the month.

But there is also a part of the gross profit margin. That is to say, we can only put it to the first three seasons because we are now in this period because the first three quarters are already a number of accountants contracted. From this table, we see that we have recovered from the part of this number in 2024 to a level around 2021 and 2020.

This is part of the performance of our operations. I would like to share with you that you are more concerned about the brand, the brand is this piece, in fact, in the German brand part, it currently represents 23.3% of our total revenue, which is the whole year in 2024, which is 43% higher than 2023, is actually a good percentage of growth.

There are a number of reasons why the first product is lily, which is a relatively high-end product, and then the second is my strategic partner, so regardless of its good and bad, it will prioritize some of the strategic partners' orders. I think this is the two most important factors. Again, the third of us is that we like it, and the last two years are very much like the On Running brand, which is a share of a revenue of 6.6%, which is 65% higher than in 2023. The brand has been growing for more than 50 percent of the year in a row, so it is a pretty good brand.

The fourth is the brand of New Balance, which accounts for 3.9% of us, which is the highest in the top ten. This part of New Balance, which accounts for the highest growth in the top ten, is called 67% growth in 2023. That is, it is a good growth in the whole product application, and it is also a good growth in these years.

This is part of the fifth largest brand. The sixth largest brand is the Arthurs Tiger, which accounts for 2.3% of our growth in 2023, which is also a part of the growth in 2023, which is also a part of the growth in 2023, which is also a part of the growth in 2023, which is 15%.

In fact, the top ten brand customers account for the whole lily group of 64.1%, which is the part of the growth in the same period in 2023 is a total of 26%, in fact, it is only high growth, this is a customer share of the brand. Again, I am still with you, because we have just mentioned that footwear and clothing are two important industries in our whole group, so one of its various brands is very concerned about us. In terms of footwear industry, New Balance growth is the largest, we just saw that it is divided into parts of the shoes, shoes and clothing. 69% of the shoe industry, 65% of the on running, the parts of the shoes of Adidas, 44% of the BOA, and 15% of the Arthurs.

Dicassinone is part of the growth of 59%, part of the garment. The portion of the Nakols has grown by 54%, part of the Gran Canaria has grown by 37%, and part of the U.S. brand has grown by 36%.

In fact, we usually share the share of the total revenue of our group. In fact, we will tell investors how much of the total assets we share, and then we will share the share of real estate, so this time I would like to report the share of the whole distribution of our 2024 and a comparison of 2023 to you. The distribution part of our revenue in 2024 is 129.13 billion, so that in 2023, the Phnom Penh network increased 20%, then the revenue in 2024 was 24.68 billion, that is, 49% of the total revenue in 2023, the total revenue we reached 15.6.1 billion, that is 24. So you can see that the growth of Phnom Penh network is superior to the growth of all my revenue.

I think this is because we have 24 avenues of growth, with a growth of 24% in 2024 and a growth in 2023, so there will be about 20% or more growth, which is normal, and even two relatively high product items are our fabrics, our main fabrics are said to be 50% or more of the growth of the Phnom Penh network. A share of the gross profit rate, in fact, the output here has reached a gross profit rate of 38.6, in fact, has returned to a normal level. That is that the part of Phnom Penh network in 2024 is 25. 1% a margin, then in 2023 it is only 15. 1, so it is also quite a considerable effort, hoping to pull the gross profit up, this is a situation.

So in 2024, the best gross margin growth is our social livestock purchase, the second is our Phnom Penh net, Phnom Penh net in 2023 margin is 15. 1, that 2024 margin came to 25. 1, but it is still lower than my average margin, so you will ask me why the month of December margin is so much so, this is a very important factor, I would say to you. The third of our products gross margin growth is our Matsui loan, Matsui loan, from March 2023 from 37. 5 to 2024, 2, this is also a very big relationship with one of our products, because it is directly designed for our customers, directly on his blood mirror, or some products we need to design him to sell well, so the relative ASP, it is the margin, it is the same as the one of the most important product, the most important part of the first time is not only.

The estimated total capital expenditure in 2025 will fall to 12.900 million. One part of the capital expenditure in that year is slightly lower than in 2024. Because the increase in equipment after the plant is covered will be 64%. The other 5% will be this other type of capital expenditure.

This is more of what I have shared with some of the brands in 2024. Next, I'll introduce you a little bit about us. It's too late. Let's take a look at this development. This is what every company has to do. The lily has to be done sooner than anyone else.

Because U.S. brands and German brands are more local than the local ones. Our local governments require much more. That's why some progress has been made throughout ESG. Lily is more attentive than others.

In terms of wastewater recycling. We all think of it sooner than others. Well, it's water recycling. The percentage of Vietnam's lily water recycling is about 65% to 70%. Because the local water cost is three times higher than Taiwan's.

The cost of water in Indonesia is six times higher than that of Taiwan. Therefore, as long as it is related to money, companies will be more concerned. So no matter what the brand asks, you must do it first. The second one is related to our EPS.

This is what the boss often talks about. That's why this is the whole thing. Brand requirements are more of an ecological pool. That's what we're emitting. Even though there are local emissions after the water is recycled, I have to comply with local regulations.

I have to go to an ecological pool to prove it. The water I emit is not a problem. That's why I have almost every place where there is a set of ecological pools. This is a green building plant. This is the factory of the limestone village of Vietnam we just talked about. It is a factory of green building design itself.

This is a light-guided energy-saving device at the Li-Li-Ming village plant in Vietnam. Look at it. The root of the purple is light-guided. When the normal weather is good, there is no need to use electricity. It will be projected directly from the sun.

There will be lighting function. Of course, this is the thing. The weather is not good with the night is to have some electricity configuration to use. Good for us to not mention it. Because there are some things we do better than others before.

Aquatic machines and carbon machines are the same. Just as we mentioned, the part of the Green Building Gold Award was obtained in August 2022. Good Social Responsibility Report. What is the part of the Sustainability Report?

Be the first to do so. Because investors have told me that there is no sustainability report and no social responsibility report is not available. Foreign investment cannot be invested. So we wrote this first in 2020 when we first started. That part of 2023 has launched a sustainability report in English.

Well. part of the product. I think I'm about to introduce a new product. In fact, I would recommend that you take a look at our 3rd floor review to see a little more in detail.

Part of the growth in medical products was the largest in 2024. It grew by 149%. A percentage. So what does it mean? More and more people need to be rehabilitated.

This is the material of the lily rehabilitation we have. The injection troughs with our belts and lily processing. So the market is actually expanding. We also applied our various products to combine it. Then we made a whole set of processing. Direct supply to our customers.

There are more and more of these sports like this. This whole set of goods part of this is the one part of this training arm. This gym will be used, but you can only see the left side.

I can't see the whole frame. It's about three months. The guests have to say that we're here to frame one. Let our visitors come as well. It's about two months later, three months later. The next law says that you can't see it.

To the right, the left is now visible. Well, this is the use of the strap product. This is the strap used for clothing. This is the slippery slope.

We were just going to talk about our lift loose straps. We loosened the margin. The main reason is because more and more brands. It wants a brand display of it. In fact, it can be seen directly on the product.

So more and more people want it. It is a bit more distinctive. It is not as black or white as before. It is good for lilies. The price of my sales is above. My margin is also above.

Because the titanium belt itself is relatively small. The market is relatively small. That we can provide more customers. No matter any of our subsidiaries, we can provide. Good that this is relatively new.

"It is good," he said, "and it is good, but it is good, and it is good, and it is good, and it is good for many."

This is also a type of loosening belt. Its shoes use it on the side of the waist. It enhances its comfort. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****
