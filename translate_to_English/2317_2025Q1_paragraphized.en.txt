Mr. Liu Yangwei, Chief Financial Officer Mr. Huang Decai, and spokesperson James are invited again today. The time of the meeting is expected to be an hour, the first stage is a briefing, and the second stage is a Q&A time. Please read the disclaimer in the briefing before the meeting is officially held. Next, enter the first stage of the meeting, there are four issues, namely review of the first quarter of 2025, the second quarter and the full year's outlook, important career progress, and recent major events.

Hello Kristin. I'm Edward Wong, and I'm going to report to you on the first quarter of 2025. Please see the fifth page, the first quarter of the 2025 election table, the first quarter revenue of NT$1.64 trillion, a 24% increase over the same period last year, a new high. The green portion, gross margin of 6.11% decreased by 0.20% year-on-year due to the impact of the portfolio. Operating profit margin of 2.83% year-on-year, mainly due to a decrease in fees, as revenue grew by 24% year-on-year.

EPS, the first quarter of EPS 3.03, increased by $1.44 compared to the previous year. Next, the sixth-page balance sheet, as of the end of March 2025, was $2929 billion in cash, 2.812 billion in cash, decreased by $1584 billion from the end of March last year, mainly due to the increase in borrowing due to working capital needs, as well as capital expenditure, and the increase in the same period of the same year due to the increase in the number of days.

The 7th page cash flow statement, as of the end of March 2025, the cash flow of business activities was 51 billion yuan, mainly due to the increase in inventory. Inventory changes are mainly due to the increase in customer's ability to pull new goods, so with the customer's preparation, but we still adhere to the principle of stable inventory management and control. Free cash flow is nearly 9.4 billion yuan, compared with last year, the cash flow increased 8 billion yuan, mainly due to the increase in cash flow of business activities, and the increase in capital expenditure.

In the same period, revenue from consumer smart products has also increased slightly compared to last year, but it has decreased to 40%, indicating that our portfolio is moving towards a more balanced direction. As mentioned in the previous law, this year's cloud network products will be closer to consumer smart products. In terms of the four major products, the performance of computer terminals is better than expected, but consumer intelligence and cloud networks are slightly backward, but the overall performance is still stable.

In the past few months, U.S. tariff policy changes have had a small impact on global supply chains and recently, coupled with the exchange rate changes, so we have a more prudent view of the future. Overall, the second quarter is expected to grow significantly compared to the first quarter and the same period last year. In terms of consumer intelligence products, we expect a slight decline in the quarter, with the introduction of new products in the first quarter, and the recent exchange rate factors, compared to the same period last year.

In addition to the recent changes in tariffs, geopolitics, and global monetary policy, the current sales estimates may not change much, but the relationship between exchange rates may affect the performance of revenue converted to Taiwan dollars. Therefore, we are more cautious about this year's outlook, so we have slightly seen significant growth in adjusting this year's outlook. As for the four major products, cloud network products remain a major growth momentum, especially AI server products.

With our flexible supply chain management and local production strategies, we have now established 233 sites globally, and our production sites span 24 countries. In addition to Asia, we have more than 50 locations in the Americas, and more than 10 locations in Europe and India, respectively. We have more years of experience in local operations and abundant human resources around the world, which enables us to respond quickly to customers' needs. This year, our cloud network products are still the main growth momentum, and we look back at the performance of AIA's server business in the first quarter of the year, which means that the demand for computing power is very strong, whether it is AI servers or a common server, shipments are significantly increased.

This year, major North American CSP plants announced that they would continue to expand their investment in AI infrastructure. This was driven by the tremendous growth of training and reasoning AI, and the volume of procurement of generic servers is also increasing, which is the reason why our overall server shipments can grow significantly. As we continue to improve our automation level, the yield of production is getting better and better. So, as I mentioned earlier, AI server performance should be better in the quarter than in the quarter.

In March at the GTC, we showcased the results of AI Factory-focused smart manufacturing applications, and for the first time, we have publicly announced Neurabot, a healthcare robot that can safely help transport hospitals in simplification, and a semiconductor composite robot that combines automatic handling.

In addition, we have also introduced digital heating technology, which has helped us improve our productivity and facility planning. In terms of building AI, we have also actively introduced the intelligent management technology of Agentic AI, hoping to improve the efficiency of the factory and the ability to integrate data. In the EV section, we believe that we have received good news from our cooperation with mountain bikes last week. In the future, we are also expected to help them sell our design and development vehicles in Oceania, which also echoes one of the three major indicators we mentioned earlier to get orders from traditional EV factories.

We hope that this cooperation with the mountains will lead us to more international factories in the future, including the cooperation opportunities of traditional Japanese factories. In addition, the long-awaited Model B decomposition bus, is also expected to officially start mass production in the second half of the year. In terms of batteries, the joint factory already has the capacity to mass production and has provided product testing to customers.

At the same time, we have superior technical specifications in the next generation of SIC MOSFETs, which can significantly improve power conversion efficiency and reduce energy waste. In this part, we expect to enter mass production in the second half of the year. As for the design services of 3DICs, we have also officially entered the high threshold, becoming one of the few manufacturers in Taiwan who can provide this service.

In the field of low-track satellites, we are actively involved in projects led by the National Space Center, and we are integrating top technologies and resources at home and abroad, and gradually perfecting the design, manufacturing and testing to accelerate our layout on 6G. The Group is responsible for the classic semiconductor equipment, and the former team has also announced the acquisition of Flandon Technology, which will help us develop the aerospace industry in the future, which will allow us to develop the drone industry. In the future, we will combine the existing technology to create more applications. Next, I would like to invite James to share with you.

In terms of corporate governance, our central park director, Mr. Yang, has taken over the wheel of the CEO, which symbolizes our groupâ€™s successor system towards a more sustainable and diverse approach. In terms of smart city promotion, we have partnered with the Taipei government to promote the design of AI-driven electric vehicles, and we are more grateful to have also been awarded with a smart city solution that will drive the future of AI. In addition, our smart electric bus vendor Digital Soft Solution has also been awarded the Smart City Innovation Application Award 2025. This part also shows our ability to apply AI in smart transportation.

In addition, we have set up the world's top 100 innovation institutions for eight consecutive years, demonstrating our long-term investment in innovation and R&D. In the field of forward-looking technology cooperation, Hon Hai Research Institute and National Taiwan University, together with NICT, Japan, have successfully broken through the key technology of new surveillance communication.

In addition, we have expanded a collection of third-party RBA VAPs, which took half a year to complete a collection across nine major campuses around the world, and achieved a full increase in confidence in the supply chain management of our performance. Last month, we also hosted the second Hon Hai Fujioka Sustainability Award, which encourages employees and suppliers from all regions of the world to use their creativity to promote ESG. In this recent event, we announced the latest generation of GB300 AI servers at this year's NVIDIA GTC, and shared the latest applications of three smart platforms, demonstrating our research and development capabilities in AI infrastructure.

In addition, we also participated in the Taipei International Motor Show and showcased the latest developments in electric vehicles, automotive components and localized batteries. Finally, at Computer Techs next week, we also participated in the exhibition, and welcome you to visit the latest generation of AI server institutions and the application of robots on the three smart platforms.

Thanks. Due to the recent changes in tariff policies, the biggest challenge for businesses is the extent of globalization and the resilience of the supply chain. Fortunately, we have developed a more regional layout many years ago, which can be flexible to adapt to the needs of our customers and have a relatively light impact.

As well as the diversity of the supply chain, under a strategy. We have continued our capacity layout globally. We are also accelerating the pace of our layout. To strengthen our capacity for regional manufacturing, regional delivery. The number of factories and offices worldwide over the past year. We have increased by more than 10%.

233. This is a more complete proof of our layout. Currently we have production lines in Mexico, India, Vietnam, Europe and other places. It is also gradually in place.

There are many plans in progress. Although tariffs cause raw materials in some areas. Or the cost of logistics will rise in the short term. However, we aim to keep product profitability stable through vertical integration and customer consultation. We also continue to automate through production.

And the benefits of scale to maintain our overall competitiveness. Tariff policies bring some challenges. But they also allow us to take further steps. It also stimulates the Group to accelerate the transformation. For the expansion of new markets in the future, as well as the diversification of services.

This service is based on the perspective of a diverse customer. Instead, it forms a long-term opportunity. Thanks to the Chairman. The next question is the exchange rate section. That would like to ask the Chief Financial Officer.

For the appreciation of the new currency. That's what I want to ask the Chief Financial Officer. The recent appreciation of the new dollar is fast. What we need to look at is the gross interest rate. There is also the impact of the exchange profit and loss on the account of the company's current revenue and the cost of this part.

What is the percentage of US dollars? What is the percentage of US dollars? What is the ratio of US dollars to US dollars? What is the ratio of US dollars to US dollars? What is the ratio of US dollars to US dollars?

Most of the natural safes can be formed. However, the functional currency of the earnings report is the currency of the United States dollar. Therefore, the currency fluctuates against the United States dollar. Any significant adverse exchange rate fluctuations will affect the performance of the currency's revenue in our account.

This can mainly affect the cost of stock in the industry. And the part of the loss. For example, when the dollar's average exchange rate rises by $1. This can affect Honghai's revenue of about 3%.

Gross margin will also be reduced by about 0.1 percent. As of now. We will continue to use inventory management mechanisms to minimize the impact of the depreciation of the US dollar on gross margin. The outside sector will indeed be affected by exchange rate fluctuations. But we have made the necessary hedges.

In addition, our company has a set of policy guidelines to cope with exchange rate fluctuations. For example, there are adjustments to the exchange rate with the client contract. And increase the frequency of quotations. And with the appropriate financial avoidance tools. Hedging the exchange rate risk arising from trading investments and financing activities.

Many other measures to reduce the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer. That's the last question. If you want to ask questions online, you can now click on the Raise Sign. We will be open to online legal and media free questions after the next question and answer.

The final question is to ask the Chairman about the status of the AI server business. That explains the overall performance in the first quarter and the expected difference in the second quarter. And the current view on the current quarter. There is a change in the outlook for AI server revenue this year. Thank you.

AI server and general-purpose server shipments improved significantly. Revenue increased by more than 50% but did not double. This was mainly because the GB series entered the stage of mass production at the end of the first quarter. So most products were only delivered in the second quarter. In the market, major North American CSP customers continued to expand their AI server deployments.

A growing support for overall shipping. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the overall server business to continue to grow. Revenue growth and year-on-year growth are expected to reach high double-digit growth.

We have also developed ASIC-based AI server with several CSP customers. And we have already shipped. In addition, HTX needs will be further.

In India, we have entered the market since 2006. This period has accumulated the ability to manage the supply chain and logistics of local employees. These are important competitive advantages. This is also a very important reason for our rapid expansion in recent years.

We also see that more and more suppliers are setting up factories in India, and we expect that the competitiveness of manufacturing in India will gradually emerge when the supply chain is full. The second question is whether we should ask the Chief Financial Officer to answer. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the last legislative session, we would like to point out that capital expenditure will continue to increase by more than 20% this year due to more opportunities and more cooperation opportunities.

Such a view has not changed. Among them, we expect to see six to seven percent of the expansion capacity, while others for automation. These six to seventy percent of the expansion capacity includes areas such as India, Vietnam, the United States, and Mexico. But just as you mentioned in the Middle East, you should not have seen it this year.

In addition, there will be a gradual contribution to the new business. Honghai will expand its new business in mainland China. In the United States, Taiwan, and India, there will also be new business investment. We have continued to diversify our global footprint over the years, allowing us to adapt to the changes in the current international economic and economic situation.

In addition, since our financial management strategy is pre-deployment, and our business cooperation with our customers is very close, we will plan ahead of time for long-term and short-term capital needs, and adapt with suitable financing tools to meet the needs of the company's operations, as well as ensure the stability of the financial structure. In fact, last year's fourth quarter until now, we have completed the issuance of ordinary corporate bonds of NT$29.50 billion, and the issuance of overseas convertible corporate bonds of US$700 million. These are all part of our existing plans.

First of all, we have been in Saudi Arabia for many years. We all know that in terms of EV, we had a joint venture with PIF and set up an EV joint venture called SEAL. After that, our FIT also worked with local well-known companies to develop EV charging devices.

At the same time, we already have a solid partnership with upstream chip operators in the AI server industry chain, and important customers in downstream. Together with our vertical integration of technical capabilities and global market share, these have been working closely with the participants from upstream to downstream. So, we believe that on these major projects, we will be involved in it. OK, next question we ask Angela, Angela, KGI Securities. Do you hear my voice?

My problem is to compare the supply and demand side of the whole demand. First of all, there should be mentioned in the demand face, that is, because of tariffs, actual customers are pulling here in advance, there are some actions. That would be to ask the chairman, is it what some products are online, we have seen a more obvious phenomenon in the first half of the year.

I think from our first quarter, the performance of big products, two of which are computer terminals, and the revenue of consumer intelligence products, have found it to be the same strong or significant growth compared to the same period last year. This is actually true, in the last five years, in addition to the production schedule adjustment, it is rare to see that both categories of products can grow at the same time.

In the second half of the year, we will pay close attention to some changes in the demand for these terminals due to the change in the environment, very quickly, so for the second half of the year, we will hold a relatively prudent view of the operating environment relatively challenging, but we believe that under the advantage of the global layout, we can give full play to the advantages of supply chain resilience, so in the second half of the year, I think we still have a lot of opportunities to win more orders.

Thank you. Angela, our business model doesn't allow us to comment on a single customer's product.

<think> OK, the user gave me a task to sort the transcription into paragraphs without deleting anything. First, I had to take a closer look at the transcription content provided, understand the sentences of each time frame, and then segment according to the context and the natural process of the conversation. First, I wanted to confirm that the user's needs were not able to delete or rewrite any sentence, so it was necessary to keep the original word. Next, I needed to identify possible intentions of each speaker and the topics they discussed, such as production of AI server racks, GB200 order issues, electric order cooperation, and Computex's Keynote content.

Next, pay attention to the interval between the timestamps. Some timestamps may be missing from 2430. 72 to 2441. 72, there may be other conversations or pauses in the middle, and this time it is necessary to determine whether a paragraph needs to be broken according to the context.

For example, Kerry's questions and James' answers should be handled separately, each as a paragraph or section. While dealing with English content, such as "Don't worry about it" and the following Chinese answers also need to be maintained as if they were not translated or rewritten. At the same time, pay attention to the consistency of timestamps to ensure that each sentence's time period correctly corresponds to the position in the conversation.

Once you are done, read back to see if there are any omissions or errors to make sure that the user's requirements are fully met. </think> I can answer that in general. Your general response is your concern. We look at the production of the entire AI server cabinet. The cabinet is not a server cabinet.

So overall performance is getting better and better. April can be seen from the revenue of the entire cloud network product. We have seen strong growth in the month to month and year. From here we can see the contribution of the growth of AI server cabinets. As we gradually matured in mass production, I believe that our shipment of AI server cabinets will continue to grow in the coming quarters.

As this is a system-level AI server rack. In the process of production, it has a large number of hardware and software integration testing requirements. Our engineering team is constantly working with customers. To optimize the entire production process.

At the same time, we want to introduce a wide range of automation technologies to improve production efficiency. So far we have seen the technical capabilities of these projects. Able to help our customers in a timely manner. Dealing with hardware and software issues and needs. This is also highly affirmed by our customers. [2441. 72-2443. 72] Kerry please.

[2447. 72-2449. 72] Chief Financial Officer and James. [2449. 72-2445. 72] The first question is to ask about the GB200 part. [2455. 72-2460. 72] I just mentioned that the current majority of production bottlenecks have been resolved. [2460. 72-2446. 72] I do not know the status of the orders seen from the chairman's side. [2465. 72-2447. 72] Is there a slight decrease in the volume of pre-production in the low quarters? [2470. 72-2447. 72]

[2477. 72-2479. 72] The answer to this question is [2479. 72-2448. 72] We see that the order is full. [2483. 72-2490. 72] Is now production is not able to enable us to test on it. [2490. 72-2493. 72] Can meet our customers' needs. [2493. 72-2497. 72] So look at the customer's needs. [2497. 72-2501. 72] This is not a plane.

[2503. 72-2512. 72] This is how many GPUs you can imagine above a cabinet. [2512. 72-2517. 72] How many connections are there? [2517. 72-2520. 72] Each of these connections is tested. [2520. 72-2525. 72] Each of these computed units is tested. [252525. 72-2527. 72] This is a long time to test. [2527. 72-2536. 72] This is what I want to do in the future of AI Server.

[2536. 72-2539. 72] will be a challenge. [2539. 72-2544. 72] But I believe that as long as there is enough resources for everyone to invest in, these challenges will become more and more customer service. [2556. 72-2556. 72] The demand is full of demand. [2564. 72-2567. 72] But the chairman wants to follow up with you. [2567. 72-2571. 72] is about production calmness.

[2571. 72-2576. 72] Because the GV200 is obviously a new product for everyone. [2576. 72-2577. 72] The complexity is very high. [2577. 72-2580. 72] But because of its next Generation GV300. [2580. 72-2587. 72] The design above is hoping to improve the problems encountered in production above 200. [2587. 72-2590. 72] Therefore, in this case, [2590. 72-2593. 72] Supply Chain is expected to be smoother in production.

[2593. 72-2596. 72] Performance is also better than GV200. [2596. 72-2599. 72] That's why there's always some voice to say. [2599. 72-2607. 72] Our mid-term customers may need to convert the GV200 to GV300. [2607. 72-2612. 72] So that the full year's shipments may be lower than originally expected. [2612. 72-2615. 72] I don't know if this is the observation seen by the chairman. [2615. 72-2618. 72] This is not the case.

[2630. 72-2624. 72] I think that the man will come soon. [2624. 72-2630. 72] The same thing we do not comment on our single client and his single product. [2630. 72-2634. 72] I suggest to ask him this question when he comes to me. [2634. 72-2638. 72] But I can answer what In general is. [2638. 72-2643. 72] GV200's accumulated experience. [2643. 72-2649. 72] Includes machine-based design, cooling system, automation production and testing techniques.

[2649. 72-2652. 72] can be greatly shortened. [2652. 72-2656. 72] We are not only in the future is the GV300. [2656. 72-2670. 72] In the future, the production of AI server cabinets such a learning curve. [2670. 72-2674. 72] So in this regard, I think it will be better. [2674. 72-2684. 72] Next question, we ask Sanli Finance's rich questions. [2684. 72-2692. 72] At the beginning of the year, we did not say that this third foot of Honghai.

[2692. 72-2696. 72] The good news is that we can take the three-way electric vehicle order. [2696. 722-2701. 72] Can't ask the chairman to share further with us the group's cooperation plan with the Japanese automakers. [2701. 722-2706. 72] There are more traditional automakers in the discussion. [2706. 722-2709. 72] Especially in the traditional automakers section. [2709. 722-2715. 72] Just like we and MOU with Sanlin companies. [2715. 722-2720. 72] We've been working for almost a year.

[2720. 72-2723. 72] So we have been telling you about this good news. [2723. 72-2727. 72] But it also took a long time. [2727. 72-27332. 72] Other manufacturers we certainly had contact with. [2732. 72-2734. 72] Of course, there are some progress. [2734. 72-274. 72] But not in the case we confirmed it at the end. [2740. 72-2743.4. 72] We will not disclose it to the public.

[2743. 72-2746. 72] But I want to respond to you, of course. [2746. 72-2750. 72] Of course there are other manufacturers who are talking about similar cooperation. [2750. 72-2756. 72] So please wait and see in this regard. [2756. 72-2756. 72] I would like to ask you to wait. [2758. 72-2760. 72] Good. [2760. 72-2762.6. 72] Next question we would like to ask.

[2762. 72-2764. 72] Yes Peiying asked. [2764. 72-2766.6. 72] Peiying asked. [2769. 72-2771. 72] Peiying heard. [2773. 72-2775.7. 72] Yes. [2775. 72-277. 72] Chairman James met you. [2777. 72-277. 72] Computex will be held next week.

[2779. 72-2783. 72] The Chairman of the Board at this time has not been able to register because of the full amount. [2783. 72-2787. 72] Can you ask the Chairman of the Board to explain the contents you would like to share with the public at that time? [2787. 72-2790. 72] And to reveal that there will be no mysterious guest appearance. [2790. 72-2791. 72] Thank you. [2791. 72-2793. 72] Thank you Peying. [2793. 72-2795. 72] This year we at Computex Keynote.

[2795. 72-2899. 72] We will use AI Factory as the theme. [2799. 72-2806. 72] Combine the three major platforms of our group with the application of robots. [2806. 72-2808. 72] Share the Honghai. [2808. 72-2810. 72] From the offer. [2810. 72-2817. 72] Becomes a vision of a platform solution company since manufacturing services transformation. [2817. 72-2819. 72]

[2819. 72-2822. 72] That will not happen. [2822. 72-2826. 72] The mysterious guest appearance. [2826. 72-2828. 72] There must be a mysterious guest. [2828. 72-2829. 72] Of course that will happen. [2829. 72-2832. 72] I just want to sell the spear first. [2832.-2834. 72] Please wait and see.

[2835. 72-2839. 72] We asked Albert, an analyst at JB Morgan, to ask a question. [2839. 72-2840. 72] Don't be rude. [2843. 72-2846. 72] Mr. Liu Dong, Chief Financial Officer, is JB Morgan Albert. [2846. 72-2847. 72] I have two questions. [2847. 72-2848. 72] The first question is [2848. 72] I remember when I met Liu Dong for the first time in 19 years.

[2852. 72-2854. 72] You mentioned this to me. [2854. 72-2857. 72] This trend in the Regional Manufacturing Center. [2857. 72-2861. 72] This trend in the past few years is not just about Honghai. [2861. 72-2863. 72] It is the whole industry trend. [2863. 72-2686. 72] Just the Chief Financial Officer has mentioned that we have increased the opening water this year. [2866. 72-2871. 72] The same industry has increased the opening water.

[2871. 72-2872. 72] I would like to know. [2872. 72-2872. 72] In the case of an increase in the opening of water throughout the industry. [2876. 72-2882. 72] The investor would be worried that this part of the report would not cause a decrease in ROIC. [2882. 72-2886. 72] It is still said that the entire improvement environment is different now. [28886. 72-2889. 72] The so-called Regional Hub is driven by the customer. [2889. 72-2892. 72] So they would prefer to pay more.

[2892. 72-2895. 72] This is my first question. [2898. 72-2901. 72] I answered the first question first. [2901-2910. 72] Our business model is based on this EMS for manufacturing OEMs. [2910. 72-2916. 72] We all reflect our manufacturing costs. [2916. 72-2918. 72] Add a Markup.

[2918. 72-2921. 72] So this is the customer. [2921. 72-2929. 72] Our customers will be able to go there to try the Adjust. [2929. 72-2937. 72] The customer will not.

The second I think this is a trend, and the customer may have to adapt to that trend, which you have mentioned recently, is the U.S. factor, but also accelerated the customer to make a change in such an adjustment. Well, this is my first question, thank you. My second question is about this Middle East part, this morning's NVITA press release, I have a little bit more to say, this Middle East customer can be about seven, eight, or even a thousand, NVITA's Rack. So I know that we may not be able to do comments on a single customer product, so I want to know that in such an economic scale, that the customer has the opportunity to move from a standard product like Supermicro deal to a standard product like ODM direct?

That's why we're here in the Middle East, and we've heard it before, but there's a huge demand for this kind of stuff, and I think it's going to be a balance between this brand and this direct purchase, and it's going to be a balance.

That's the balance, and that's what we're going to talk about together with our clients to discuss planning. Well, that's okay. Next question we're going to ask Arthur for help, Arthur for help, Arthur for help. Did Arthur hear me? Can you hear me?

I want to ask the chairman that I have done an analysis, I do not know that the chairman's view is that, especially the largest customer of this smartphone, that the U.S. revenue accounted for this product line is about 30%, that the second should be China, and then it should be here. That's very interesting to say that this product line is a smart phone, about selling to South East Asia and India, about 21%, that is, if we want to avoid tariffs, is whether the chairman or the company here, the sales of the U.S. is going to India, so far, this capacity should not be a way to go forfeal the needs of the U.S. market, I don't know if there is no plan for 90 days, that's the 90 day of exemption is another day. Well, thanks to the chairman, the second question, I just heard that this is the ASIC server, so I can not ask, is the company on the level 10 or level 10, the customer is not the North American big CSP, that is also the ASIC server, I see that the company has to invest in this Houston, then I can not ask the chairman, or this thing should be, is also the assembly of the ASIC server, because I do not know that the chairman may be more familiar with the industry, that is, because the U.S. now needs to bring these manufacturing back to the U.S., the TSMC in the U.S. may also produce more advanced chips in the future, that is not to say that the whole more important customer, all high-level chips to the point of production, then directly in the U.S.

OK, about what to do in the United States, your logic is correct, is there is this IC, of course, there is a module there, made this PCBA there, and then assembled there into a server, and then turned level into a G-Grid level 11, so this logic is right, so there is still time in this order, is to see the whole manufacturer's supply chain ready.

That's right. Ä‘Ã³ about what you just mentioned ASIC is. We refer to CSP clients. You know that CSP clients have developed their own ASICs. That's probably what they mean, and this CSP client ASIC will do level 10. Well, now it's 3:59, we open the last question, we ask this Marguerite Kelin, Kelin, and ask, Kelin.

Kelin said, "Did you hear what I heard, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, Mr. President, James, I would like to ask you about our reduction of 2025 revenue outlook, but if you look at the product otherwise, we do not have any adjustments in the direction of the arrow. I would like to ask you if this adjustment is due to the relationship of the exchange rate, to fully adjust the outlook on all products line, or to say that we have seen which product line may be downside.
