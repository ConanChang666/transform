Now the speech of Wuhan Jianda Industrial Co., Ltd. is officially started. Today, it is a great honor to invite Spokesperson Liu Huijun. Mr. Yang Yating brings you to understand the operation of the company. Then we will give the time to Mr. Yang first. Thank you.

Welcome to join Q2's Open Law Conference in 2025. Today's legal meeting is divided into two sessions. The first part will be a brief introduction. The company's operations in the first half of 2025. Then there will be our Spokesperson Liu Huijun Liu.

Let's start with the QA part, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.

Just a little bit. OK. Ok. That's the case. Let's briefly explain some basic information about the company.

Kenda is currently the world's top five manufacturer of bicycle tires. We are talking about the amount of production we have today. We can reach 800,000 tires daily. That's the one from the outside.

We currently have 7 production plants in Asia. That's over 10 billion US dollars in our revenue in 2024. That's over 12000 employees worldwide. We have R&D centers in 4 locations in the world, including Europe, Taiwan, and China.

We have more than 300 full-time R&D personnel. Those last two years from 2024 to 2025. Those last two years from 2024 to 2025. Our products are also recognized by many awards.

The ida International Design Award in the United States. There are also Taiwan's boutique awards. It gives us a lot of glory. It is the distribution of our main business locations. It is just a reference to our Asian economic design awards. It is just a reference to our Asian economic design awards.

There are seven production plants. In addition to Taiwan, there are seven production plants in Asia. In the United States and Europe, there are wheels production, as well as the assembly of wheels and tires. These production plants in the United States and Europe. The main purpose of this section is to industrial tyres.

This is because the distribution of this liquid. This is the section of the tire of the industrial tyre. Because the customer who uses the tyre will like it. That is, we put our product as a wheel group. The wheel with the tyre assembled. The way a wheel with a tyre is sold.

They prefer this model. So we have a vertically integrated movement in the US and Europe. Integrate this wheel manufacturing and the manufacturing of tyres together. Part of Asia is the comparison of pure tyre manufacturing plants. In mainland China, we have three factories. But our Shenzhen factory is in line with the needs of local policies.

It was discontinued in the middle of last year. Then turned into a sales company. The original factory has begun to carry out land development plans. There is also a factory in Quanshan, and a factory in Tianjin. In Vietnam, we have two factories.

There are two factories in Taiwan. There is a factory in Indonesia. The product is basically selling a lot of areas. In five continents around the world, we can basically see our products. This is the area of our US subsidiary distribution.

We manufacture a wheel factory in the United States. Martin Hill at 212 Akron. There is a new wheel factory. There is a new wheel factory. At present, the factory is close to completion.

The device is currently in operation. It is currently expected to be officially launched in the third quarter of 2025. Well, that is where our European subsidiary is located. Our R&D center is the main country in Europe. Basically, we all have companies that sell it.

There is also a manufacturing plant. Just mentioned that we have four R&D centers all over the world. Akron in the United States. UberSea in Germany. There are zoning mountains in China. There are cloud forests in Taiwan.

We all have R&D centers. That's what we're talking about right here in Germany? We're looking for R&D centers. We may also expand our R&D centers by 2025. We may also be somewhere else. Maybe it's near Berlin.

We also set up a new R&D center. We also continue to have a lot of pondering in terms of sustainability. That's because today's time is limited. That's what I'm talking about.

Some internationals have come to us for the equality of our ESG. That is, FTSRUSO in 2024. S&P Global in 2024. And Corporate Governance in 2024. Our results have come to us. That is, FTSRUSO.

Our results have also risen by 0.2 levels in 2023. S&P Global said. We have also increased by 8 points in 2023. We are flat on corporate governance evaluations. That's what we do in terms of sustainability.

This is a simple company introduction. Then I will start to tell you about the different products.

The current screen is. As of April 2022 to 2024. Our main products are different. The comparison of current sales. That can be seen. We divide this product into three main sections.

The leftmost part is the inner and outer tire of the bike. The middle part is. We combine this motorcycle tire and industrial tyre. The rightmost part is the radial tyre. This part is mainly our sedan tire.

A part of the so-called PCR tire. That can be seen. Motorcycle tires, as well as industrial tires. In our group. In fact, the sales has always been very stable.

The share has always been very stable. The market of motorcycle tires and the market of industrial tires. Whether it is in our internal or external market. It is relatively stable. That is, our share is the same.

***Product sales comparison**. But if we go back to that level in 2022, we're basically three minutes in the sky. It's like a state in three minutes in the sky. But until January to April 2024.

The radial layer of tires our sales share. Or greater than that of the bike, but the problem is that we do see the bike tires. It is actually already in the beginning. Slowly, slowly, slowly re-arranged.

Well, that's what we're talking about right now. A simple comparison of that sale of each product. ** Tariffs affect**. That's if someone cares about our company.

We know that we are at various production plants in Asia. In fact, we have more or less exports to the United States. Shares. So we will also take a little while today. A little bit about the recent tariff policy in the United States is for us.

The impact of operations. After the Trump administration came to power in January, there was a lot of trade policy going on. Of course, a lot of voice news is of course, U.S.-Canada. The tariffs on the border. And then it was similar to trade.

Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. There is also the so-called. The equivalent tariff section. The timeline section here. Refer to the current screen.

In March, it was first announced that it was right. Steel and aluminum products increased tariffs by 25%. This is the scope of clause 232. This was also the case when the 3rd April was also the import tariff increased by 25%. Clause 232 is the import.

Imported cars. On the road with a 25% increase in tariffs. And that's what I'm talking about too. May 3rd. 25% increase in tariffs for all incoming vehicle components. This is also a clause 232.

This is the night of the whole car tariff. This is the terms of the month. This is also the terms of the 232. In addition to the terms of this 232, there is also the beginning of April.

Mr. Trump's government. The Peer Tariff section. Well, here comes the easy. Let's talk about this reciprocal tariff. This is the U.S. Peer Tariff.

In the Trump administration. He announced this peer-to-peer tariff. The data they came up with is this data on the current screen. How does this data affect us? We build a big company. We use this graph to explain it.

In this part of the right half of the right half, there is a simple, say, in Asia. We are in China. China has a factory in Taiwan India.

These four countries. All of them are in the list of equivalent tariffs. The tariffs are imposed. As shown on the screen now. China was originally charged 34%. Vietnam was 46% Taiwan 32% India 32%.

But China. If you are concerned about the news, you should know that there is a lot between China and China in the third and fourth May. Defense. It was once raised. 14% are now.

The current date is May 14th. The agreement is to drop to 30% first, the tariff between them is to drop to 30% first, the rest.

So, this is where other than China is at the moment. It's all part of a 10-percent baseline tariff. Well, we're just talking about this trade expansion, in addition to being affected by this peer tariff. The trade expansion law is a 1962 rule.

That's what the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Industry Security is all about. This investigation agency believes that this imported product could pose a threat to U.S. national security. He certainly gave the U.S. president.

Whether it is a state or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state of a state, or a state, or a state of a state of a state, of a state, or a state, or a state of a state, of a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state, of a state, or a state, of a state, or a state, a state, a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, of a state, or a state, or a state, of a state of a state, of a state, of a state, or a state, of a state, or a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state, or a state of a state of a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state of a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state of a state of a state, or a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state, or a state, or a state, or a state, or a state of a state, or a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state of a state, or a

Automotive components. All of them are subject to this trade expansion Act 232. The scope of the course. That speaks a lot about our products.

We are now exporting to the United States. How much of our U.S. importers do we have? Taxes are tax burdens that must be borne by us.

This tyre I also distinguish as the tyre we just made for that sale. This is the bike tyre. Motorcycle tyres. Industrial tyres and sedan tyres. And industrial tyres and sedan tyres. Parts of the inner tyre.

If it is not produced in China, it is produced in other countries. We may receive tariffs later. Importers may receive tariffs that are required to be certified. The basic tariff is 4%.

For example, the current equivalent tariff for Taiwan is 32%. It is a product produced from Taiwan. It is exported to the United States.

Importers in the U.S. must pay. 42% plus a 32% Total tax rate. The production in China is in addition to the so-called basic tariffs. In addition to the equivalent tariffs, there is another.

It's a bit more complicated when it comes to tires. This is mainly because of the past few years. Business in the United States. Car tires produced in various regions are more or less. Reverse subsidies and vice versa.

This is why we produce more or less areas of production of sedan tires. These anti-subsidies and anti-dumping and anti-subsidies tariffs.

This is something else to mention. We have confirmed it later. 232 items. There are also those for auto parts. Iron and steel aluminum, basically as long as there are 232 items.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided copying fragments, sorting them into paragraph copying. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the copywriting structure provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, such as [970. 12-971. 40]. My task is to sort these dispersed sentences in logical order into consecutive paragraphs while retaining all the original content.

This may involve identifying which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same paragraph, and then combining them together. First, I read the entire transcript to understand the overall content. It looks like this is about the impact of U.S. tariffs on the tire industry, and the discussion of company response strategies.

For example, the tariff section of 232 and the tariff section of different countries may need to be combined into a paragraph. Similarly, the policy section needs to be aligned. The product development section needs to be segmented by product type, such as electric vehicle tires, bike tires, and car tires. It is important to note that some sentences may be overlapping or jumping on timestamps, but the user requests not to delete anything, so they must be arranged in chronological order. For example, [970. 12-971. 40] is a reference, followed by [971. 66-974. 48] so that our sedans are included in Section 232, which should be joined together to form a natural segment.

In addition, some sentences may belong to the same paragraph logically, but timestamps may not be continuous. For example, in relation to tariff comparisons in Taiwan and Vietnam, it may be necessary to combine the relevant sentences together. At the same time, pay attention to the connection words such as "that", "so", etc., to help determine the relationship between sentences.

At the same time, keep the transition between paragraphs natural, using appropriate verbs or punctuation to make the entire transcription smooth and easy to read. In summary, the steps include: to read through and understand content, identify topics and paragraphs, arrange sentences in logical order, merge relevant sentences into paragraphs, check for integrity and consistency. To ensure that all the original content is preserved, no deletions or modifications, and ultimately present a structured, easy-to-read paragraph-through transcription script.

For example, when it comes to Vietnam-made sedans, he will be subject to tariffs on basic tariffs, 232 terms, and more than 6% of the anti-subsidization tariffs that were originally investigated for the previous few years. Taiwan will be base tariff 232 terms, plus 88% of the anti-dumping tariffs that were investigated for the same reason as Vietnam. If it is in China-produced, his tax fees will be base tariff 232 terms, 301 terms, and anti-dumping tariffs. Well, that's why we're saying that the various types of tires produced by our company are going to sell to the U.S., the main tariffs will be sorted as shown in the current picture. Of course, we' are very active in response to say that if we' tariffs, for the future tariffs, for example, if we's are actually being enforced, then what we's.

For example, when it comes to sedans, 25% of the current 232 has already been implemented, and what we have said in the U.S. market is an action to improve our terminal price. We hope that this is a price increase and we want to minimize the impact of these tariffs. In the future, we will continue to observe the future implementation of tariffs, we have a team in the U.S. specifically to look at the current changes in these tariffs, and we will actively respond to the measures, whether it is an increase in the price of the terminal market, or we expand the specifications of each other wheels or tires, etc., and that is the U.S. tariffs impact on us.

In the United States, there are also some things such as iron fabrication, etc., so this 232 clause is relatively beneficial for our U.S. wheel manufacturing. That is, the above explanation is for your reference. Next, I will take a moment to talk about the current product development situation for each of our respective products.

First of all, we talked about the part of our station. It was said that this year was the year of our station's electric vehicle. We should say that we have been preparing for the launch of many electric vehicle stations since last year. In the first quarter of this year, our 616 EV has been successfully launched in the Asian region. The 616 EV is a product of Aftermarket developed in our Asian market, which is our first dedicated electric vehicle tire. In North America, we also have a product similar to this high-end electric vehicle tire, which is the one of our Vesta's ASV Tires.

Its testing vehicle its target is Tesla Model 3. That is what we are currently looking forward to at the U.S. Auto booth at the end of 2024, which we have basically seen. We are also expected to be on the market in the first and second quarters of 2026.

The K1271 has a very important development that it is also a special tire for electric bicycles. It has a certification of our ECER75 in Europe. The special feature of this 75 certification is that our bicycle tires are usually low speed tires, but this tire is also used because it is used for electric bicycle tires at a relatively fast rate, which means that it can be used for relatively high-speed driving, which is also certified.

The last time I was on the fairway, I mentioned this series of TRADE TRACK MASTER DTR-K6342 that we launched this year. It was a special one for us in this series, and we also developed the so-called BIAS part and the RADIO part. The part in the fairway has been fully developed, and the part of the ballet is expected to be completed in the next month. This is also part of our recent product.

It is a relatively functional tyre, and it is also our recent highlight product. The industrial tyre is what we keep our original product line to push, including the original golf tyres, and the previously mentioned inflatable tyres, which we are currently and continue to push. That is to simply tell us about the current operating conditions of each tyre, as well as our product development. Next, we will talk about the results of our operations in the first half of the year. Now we can see that our consolidated profit table for each quarter in 2025, and we can see that our sales revenue is about NT$88 billion. The part of this 88 billion NT dollar is actually a very remarkable performance, compared to the 1st quarter of 2024, we have risen by 5%, compared to the 4790th quarter in 2024.

In fact, as we predicted earlier this year, the situation of sales without the impact of tariffs, we have to predict that this year's sales should be a better situation than the previous year. The business gross profit and the Q4 of 2024 are about 19%. The only difference is that the external revenue and expenditure part is about 1 billion, in the 4th quarter of 2024, but by 2025, the first quarter accounted for 20 million. The main reason is that the exchange rate difference is about 33 at the end of 2024, but by the end of the third quarter it has fallen to 32, so there will be a relatively large difference in this part.

This is the best EPS performance of the year since 2017. It is the best EPS performance of the year since 2017. The Group's combined revenue portion is as good as it used to be. By April 2025, our revenue reached 3.1 billion, and the monthly revenue to 3.1 billion, compared to April 2024, last year. Then, we have just mentioned that Q1 revenue in 2025 is really better than Q1 in 2024.

This is a comparison of Q1's operating income for another year. The gross profit margin in 2024 is a high point, mainly because the raw material is a relatively low level between 2023 and 2024. You can see our gross profit margin in 2022 to a low level, but after Q2 in 2023, there is a jittery Q4 in 2023 to a high point. Although there is a slight decline in each quarter, it is basically a slow decline in Q4, that is, from 23.93 to 2024, but in general, the gross profit margin performance of 2024 is good, which is a high point of year.

This is a change in the gross profit margin that we combined, so we can see that the maximum gross profit margin in 2021 is 22. 04%, which is the highest point since 2021 20. 49%. Well, the current trend of our raw materials, we can see that we just came to a high point in December 2024, and Q1 in 2025 is still a little higher, but when the Trump administration's tariff policy comes out, we can see that the price of the raw materials will be a downward trend of comparison blocks, which is really good for us to make a profit.

The entire development of our industrial project can be divided into two main parts: one is the dormitory and the other is the so-called office plant. There are four parts of our office plant, and two parts of the dormitory. So far, the progress of the industrial plant has basically been covered up to the height of some of the floors have been completed, so there are currently all the work on the exterior wall and the internal construction part.

We first look at our industrial plant part: the first part of our industrial plant is the current so-called glass curtain wall construction. The first floor is the construction of the hall is also started, and the construction of some floors is already good. So the main dormitory, uh, should be said that the structure of the main building is also covered, and the outer layer is already in the construction condition. Until the construction of the exterior wall is completed, then we will carry out an acceptance of the construction of the interior, then we can check back, then we will start the subsequent sale of Ah rental-related commercial behavior, then we will continue to start.
