Mr. Chen: First, I would like to tell you the number of our entire Q1.

Next, we will talk to you about the entire product line, our current situation, and our future prospects. We will leave a lot of time to do the Q&A situation. Vice President Chen: The company's product line is more familiar. This year, more will be more than one power supply, POWER SUPPLY. Mainly based on our previous ASRock main board, which, four and five years ago, our motherboard certainly has an approximate or 90% of our revenue. Vice President Chen: In addition to the beginning of the server industry computer, then the next from our graphics card, then monitor, and then POWER SUPPLY, so that the whole monitor can now take our gravity to slow down.

Vice President Chen: This is the whole freight, because the growth of the whole business will also increase, so the whole business cost, in the first quarter of this year to reach 89 billion. Vice President Chen: That the whole business profit is 67.57 billion, YOY is 119% growth. The external part of that industry, 6400 million, compared to the same period last year. Vice President Chen: That this year's industry interest income is about half the exchange revenue, so compared to the same period last year, the exchange income has a relatively large part, so the whole industry outside the industry has declined.

Vice President Chen: This part of the talk will make the whole parent company, growth will be more than the growth of our current business. Vice President Chen: In terms of the structure of the asset, the current company is mainly still in the cash retrieval and inventory, the stock part is because the expansion of the whole business, whether it is just mentioned in our AI product line or VGA product line, or even some new product lines such as Power Supply.

Vice President Chen: This is mainly a short-term fund, so this figure will change a little bit. Vice President Chen: The whole payment part or the whole payable payment side, which accounts for 27%. Vice President Chen: The whole debt ratio is because of the fact that the permanent work here, his entire money demand or purchase demand is relatively large, so the whole debt ratio rose from 44% to 52%.

Vice President Chen: So the whole of 2.82 million is a withdrawal situation. Vice President Chen: That investment activity is clear about the situation, our investment activities are not really too much changes, the main changes are fixed deposit and cash positions.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's rules carefully to ensure that the user doesn't delete, rewrite, or consolidate any original sentence. The user emphasizes that all sentences must be retained, so I want to pay special attention to this. Next, I will analyze the verbatim snippet provided by the verbatim.

This section should be merged into a paragraph to discuss investment activity and cash status. It should then be related to the trend of revenue, including the situation of AI products and VGA, as well as the expectations of Q2. This section needs to be expressed consistently, and may be divided into two to three paragraphs, discussing the performance and expectations of different product lines.

In the process of finishing, I will check whether there are missing sentences and ensure that the sequence of timestamps is correct. At the same time, note that the user mentions "not to delete any sentences", so each sentence must appear in the final paragraph, but make it easier to read through reasonable segmentation and synthesis. The challenge that may be encountered is how to deal with duplicate or similar content, such as multiple Q2 expectations and gross rate effects.

In addition, pay attention to the correct use of professional terms, such as "OVO", "QOQ", etc., may need to keep the original, but the user does not require explanation, so keep the original sentence. Finally, read the whole finishing paragraph, confirm that all sentences are correctly positioned, no omissions or errors, and the paragraph structure is clear, logically coherent. Make sure to meet all the requirements of the user, especially without modifying the content, only adjust the format. </think> Here is the finishing paragraph-based script: In fact, the whole slide investment activity of the cash flow, in fact, there are only a few, about tens of millions, a slight fluctuation.

In the end of the whole period of cash is about 4 billion, the cash part is about 4 billion, if combined with our fixed deposit, the whole sliding group's cash, the whole water level is about 5.1 billion, then the cash required for our entire operating activities is still the same rate. The whole people are more concerned about the trend of revenue, we have now, is a trend that is showing a foot in the growth trend. So of course, just mentioned the AI products now combined with the situation of VGA, it is said that in the Q2 part of the Q2, because the Q1 is a relatively high base generation, Q2 may be because the situation is in the Q2 is a low season, this year, we see that the situation is, we will be affected by some of the low season, so the motorboat will show a slight decline in the year, so the demand will be more than the next year, so it will be more than the next year will be more than the next year, so we will be more than the most.

However, the negative factor is that the trend of our molars is due to the rapid growth of AI and VGA products, so the whole company is expanding at a rapid rate, but the overall gross profit margin is below. In this stage, we see that, regardless of whether this year's second or the second half of this year's perspective, AI's share of the ratio may increase at a higher rate or a relatively high rate, so the whole gross profit margin is still expected to decrease at a lower rate, especially the impact of the entire gross profit margin in the second quarter of the year. Therefore, in the future, if you look at the second quarter of the quarterly report, you may see that the total merger or permanent attendance report will be relatively different, the gross profit margin may be relatively lower, but there will be a relatively large outside the industry reflected in this section, which is mainly because the relationship between the functional currency of the financial function of the currency, so that he would have to produce in the gross profit margin turned into the outside of the industry, which will have the effect of the whole gross profit margin will be, and then in the second quarter of this year, he will probably affect the whole Huaqin to look at, and maybe even affect the impact of 2 to 3 percentage points, which will be about 6%, which will be just mentioned, because he will be said the whole gross profit margin relationship because of the exchange rate, the relationship, the value of the NT dollar, so let this part of the gross profit margin should be slightly flucturned, so that the whole net interest rate should be a slight change, the situation should be a little.

These are some of the financial explanations, then we will leave the time to our general manager to explain the current situation of our entire product line.

The first part of the mainboard is the CO pattern, the second part is going to the low season, the market is almost the same, but AMD is very high, the current proportion is very high, so this part is also better. The second part is expected to look at the second half of the year, we should now look at AMD to maintain such a strong, not too much problem. The overall market is to enter the Q-way into the low season, then Q3 so far look at the customer response, but still strong, so we think that this year Modelboard should maintain a growth trend, not too much problem, which is part of the mainboard.

If you are looking for a new product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, you may be looking for a better product. However, if you are looking for a better product, the Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 Q3 is far far away from Q4.

So far, it looks like the whole server, this year, so far it seems to be only positive, it is likely that QoQ is basically going up the road, which is the fourth quarter of the year, the Q2 gross profit is a little different, then Q3 Q4 should be better, because we have to adjust our gross profit slightly in the second half of the year, so we think we will be better than the first half of the year, so we see the market now we will be better than the first half of the year, so the main market still focus on North America and Europe AI is a little less, that it looks like the market is not good, this is the part of the server.

If you are looking for a new way to buy a new product, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. However, if you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. However, if you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. If you are looking for a new one, you may want to buy a new one. In the future, we will continue to look at this market, which is what we see in the long run. In addition to the LLM, we will slowly see the application of AGE AI, which is also getting more and more mature, and this market includes some Graphic Card, some Workstation's Budgetary AI solution, which is expected to be in the second half of the year, we will have some contribution, and of course, it will not be as large as AI server, because it is a comparison of simplification, compared with budgetary AI, but we think it is a long-term thing that should be followed in the second half of the year.

Then Q3 will be the main V200, but there will be some V300. Q4 may be mostly V300, or a small number of V200. This is probably true, so go basically very few, very few, right. No problem, OK, ask, because NV has the so-called RVX nash server, the RVX6000 here will be some of our special departments, or we only need V300?

The two are completely different customers, are completely different customers, revenue, of course, that Raving is also, different from a few levels such as this. But now we see is that like RTX600Pro600, 6000 is not 600Pro6000, more and more people will ask for this product, we see only a lot of things, will slowly this product appear. Of course, it has a lot of deformation, including what you do with the Graphic Card, this MD also wants to do, so the MD has the kind of Pro, belongs to the Commercial Series Graphic Card, that is also there will be, so this is just that I'm talking about the solution of the Inference Edge AI these things, application, this part we think will come up, especially next year, because I just want RTX a little bit, it's like Graphic Card, it's GPU card, but after you can not sell NVIDIA GPU, so it is only to sell its RTX.

yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[1927. 98-2037. 98] The pulse also goes to sleep in the United States, and the motherboard goes to sleep in the United States. Your sleeping problem is not solved. You can't group in the United States, I just go to the Mexican group. [1935. 98-1940. 98] Now you're all in the Mexican group, and you're in the United States and you're sleeping in the United States.

[1940. 98-1947. 98] component is not going to go to sleep, now component is going to go to sleep. Oh, so this is not so quickly done in the U.S. group. [1950. 98-1956. 98] Because now everything is going into the U.S. tariffs, you can't solve this problem. So, I don't think the U.S. has yet fully figured out how to do it. [1956. 98-1962. 98] So, we're going to go to prepare. But there should be a sympathetic time to see what's past.

[1962. 98-1996. 98] Large companies will pass, and small and medium-sized companies are unlikely to go. For the time being, Mexico can solve these problems. [969. 98-1974. 98] Mexico Canada can solve these problems, right now. Mexico Canada can solve these problems. [1974. 98-1984. 98] Mexico Canada can solve these problems, it should be our simple problem, the market can only be tight. [1984. 98-1991. 98] The market is still tight, the market is still tight.

[1991. 98-1998. 98] is some connector, the market is still tight. It is the comparison, the market is tight. [1998. 98-2001. 98] connector or some cable class, the market is tight. High-speed cable, the market is tight. [2001. 98-2005. 98] Or some high-speed one, the market is tight.

[2005. 98-2008. 98] Most of these things, the market is still tight. Because the problem is, for example, you say that this is on cable. [2008. 98-2013. 98] Each server you design is different, that is, it is different cable. You have to be 12 cm you are two. [2013. 98-2019. 98] He will not be 12 cm to replace 10 cm, that is the characteristics of the server.

So his thing was too much customization. [2019. 98-2023. 98] So it turned into a very limited production capacity, so it's slowly now. Because there are only a few things that were done before this high-speed cable and a high-speed connector. [2023. 98-2023. 98] Then the last two years more and more, then we think that the problem is going to be solved. [2023. 98-2023. 98] Now, because everyone suddenly, business is not good.

So this place turned out to be quite tight. [2037. 98-2046. 98] Tight is like that, there are some other high-speed one, the one with the Internet. vk or these mesh cards this thing. [2046. 98-257. 98] I think it is the supply side deliberately controlling the goods. So it will always be tight like this. [2057. 98-2067. 98] Of course, we dare not lose order.

Of course, if you have a lot of people under the loose order. [2067. 98-2072. 98] You may not have this problem, so we are a little conservative. So we may need some time. [2072. 98-2077. 98] To resolve this, but this looks like it's probably all gone out by the end of July. [2077. 98-2080. 98] Yeah, this now looks like we're getting better because we're doing APEC.

[2080. 98-2103. 98] So I feel that APEC may be the same as the United States. APEC and the United States may be the same as the United States. [2103. 98-2121. 98] You say which of the three regions in Europe is down. Europe is down because there are so many leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. [2121. 98-2129. 98] Then the United States, if you only look at Huaqing. The Asia-Pacific region will be the highest proportion to the United States.

[2129. 98-2140. 98] Then Europe will be the continent again, if that is the case. It is also the highest country in Asia Pacific and the United States. [2140. 98-2145. 98] Because the server in Europe is very small, so if you look at all Europe will be smaller. [2145. 98-2148. 98] Or the United States and Asia are the main, right?

[2148. 98-2161. 98] It looks like, but it is not. Internationally, it is not. [2161. 98-2169. 98] But we expect that the second half will be adjusted. That is to say, I cannot adjust the combination. [2169. 98-2176. 98] The combination is the market view and the combination is the market view. However, because the second quarter of AI server's gross profit is poor.

[2176. 98-2188. 98] But we have a plan to scale up the gross profit of AI server in the third quarter. This is just what I mean. [2188. 98-2192. 98] I can't adjust the mix, but the mix is to see the market and the business of our streets. I can't adjust it. [2192. 98-2198. 98] But we can adjust our customers and our product competitiveness.

[2198. 98-2203. 98] But this I just wanted to say, we've also adjusted it. That's not to say that it's possible that the proportion of AI is getting bigger and bigger. [2203. 98-2216. 98] This drags our overall gross profit margin. But Europe is still positive. [2216. 98-2219. 98] Because the area is bigger, right.

[2219. 98-2225. 98] Those who come out more than all are mine, and my profit. Yes. [2225. 98-2234. 98] There is also a possibility of a raise of one of the two, one is. When I grow up, I can go down. [2234. 98-2242. 98] There are some costs that I can afford, so there are two. One is my costs that I can go down.

[2242. 98-2246. 98] One of the things that I may raise is because of AI. I can raise a little bit and don't need to raise too much. [2246. 98-2250. 98] Yeah, B300 should have a better chance than B200. Right. [2250. 98-2271. 98] And last year H series was better than last year. So this is what we are doing.

[2271. 98-2304. 98] We do what we do, we do what we do, we do. Because we froze, we have creditor. [2304. 98-2333. 98] I use, I use.
