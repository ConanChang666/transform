[801. 88-804. 18] We first review last year's fourth quarter and last year's 2020 global operational highlights. [804. 18-806. 90] The last year's 2024 revenue was an example. [806. 90-808. 92] was high. [808. 92-811. 10] The new high after the pandemic. [811. 10-813. 66] The fourth quarter's overall revenue was recorded as a season. [813. 66-815. 98] The main reason we included the seasonal impact of the low season.

[815. 98-817. 90] There is also customer adjustment stock. [817. 90-820. 22] That, as well as the portion of the price reduction. [820. 22-824. 30] In addition, in the car, the driver IC. [824. 30-826. 86] has the benefit of touch and display. [826. 86-827. 90] Display integration. [827. 90-829. 18] Model driver IC.

[829. 18-830. 20] TDDI [830. 20-832. 26] The new case continues to be mass production. [832. 26-838. 90] So our momentum remains relatively stable in this product. [838. 90-841. 72] Next, our focus is on the operation of this quarter. [841. 72-845. 56] This quarter, although the industry still belongs to the low season. [845. 56-847. 62] The work patch decreases. [847. 62-850. 42] But consumer product demand in China.

[850. 42-853. 24] is underpinned by a subsidies policy that continues to drive. [853. 24-854. 78] sees market demand. [854. 78-857. 60] The demand is eager to increase. [857. 60-858. 62] The other. [858. 62-861. 70] The uncertainty brought by the new U.S. tariff regime. [861. 70-865. 02] makes a mid-term customer likely to be stocked in advance.

[865. 02-869. 38] This will then lead to an increase in the demand for IT market. [869. 38-872. 44] We see the shipment of our three product lines. [872. 44-873. 22] All the animations. [873. 22-876. 28] The part that drives ICs in large-sized sizes. [876. 28-879. 10] TV and monitor demand is better. [879. 10-880. 38] But it is not possible.

[880. 38-882. 68] can maintain stability. [882. 68-884. 74] AMOLED driver IC section. [884. 74-886. 78] Mobile phone shipments remain stable. [886. 78-887. 56] Wear. [887. 60-890. 42] The demand for the product is increased. [890. 42-893. 24] That in the automotive public driver IC section.

[893. 24-896. 56] This part of the demand has fallen due to the low season list. [896. 56-897. 84] for new products. [897. 84-898. 86] for new customers. [898. 86-901. 32] and the introduction of new models. [901. 32-904. 40] We see long-term stability. [904. 40-906. 44] The additional price section.

[906. 44-908. 50] We see that cold security continues to be facing. [908. 50-914. 12] The pressure of panel manufacturers to demand a downturn. [914. 12-916. 58] This is our presentation. [916. 58-921. 42] Next, enter Q&A time. [921. 42-924. 24] This law is based on text questions. [924. 24-927. 56]

[927. 56-928. 84] Click on Yuanda. [928. 84-931. 40] and chat directly to provide a question. [931. 40-934.1. 04] Welcome to ask questions. [934. 04-937. 12] We first answer the questions before the meeting. [937. 12-943. 26] The first part is about operation and industry outlook. [943. 26-945. 06] This part is answered by the chairman.

[945. 06-946. 08] The first part is about operations and industry prospects. [946. 08-946. 60] This part is answered by the chairman. [946. 60-950. 70] The first question is raised by Lucas Liu of HRI. [950. 70-952. 74] The question is about. [95. 74-955. 56] LDDI [956. 34-957. 12] T-COM [957. 12-957. 90] PMIC [957. 90-959. 44] SMDDDI [959. 44-960. 72] In-car industrial control.

[960. 72-963. 04] What is the trend of economic growth or economic downturn in this part. [963. 04-964. 58] and Q1. [964. 58-966. 62] Application requirements for mid-term applications. [966. 62-968. 42] What are the trends. [968. 42-970. 46] The chairman's answer. [970. 46-973. 02] Investment advanced to make the best use of everyone.

[973. 02-974. 56] I just wanted to see who we are. [974. 56-974. 98] Uh. [974. 98-978. 30] The investor relationship has given a brief description of the operation of the first quarter. [978. 30-980. 10] The outlook for the situation. [980. 10-982.4. 42] I'm here to supplement the explanation is. [982.4-984. 98] If you look at the first quarter.

[984. 98-988. 56] The positive factors are China's subsidies policy as well. [988. 56-992. 40] The uncertainty of U.S. tariffs.

The negative factor is that there is a decrease in the number of working days in the low season in the industry. If we look at the product, we see the demand for large-sized motor IC TV Monitor increases. The ROBEC is relatively flat.

In the first quarter of 2025, the company's growth momentum mainly comes from which product lines or applications can see how the market share increases in 2025. Antony Lau asked if it could reach a double-digit level of revenue growth in 2025, and that's why Cathay Investment Bank asked why the company's outlook on this year's revenue growth is so important.

We believe that this year will be relatively stable about OLED wear and IT part of this part, we believe that this year will continue to grow the large-size motor ICD COM and PIMIC products line we expect to have the opportunity to achieve double-digit growth, the third is the car and industrial control we still maintain a consistent view is that we can maintain a steady growth at the same time we also invest in the development of the new display technology here, including heating inventory liquid crystals and micro LEDs, we see that this year there will be the opportunity to grow this product line into mass production stage more than thank the chairman to answer the question is KGY Lucas Liu, the question is about the company's future and what applications to see more competitive companies in the future, how we will be able to see how we have competition in the company's response to the company's leading technology, and we can also have a new product collaboration development, and we will continue to strengthen our customer confidence in this year. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

Thanks to the Chairman for the answer. The above is the question about the operational aspect. The next is the question about the slowdown in price. So, first of all, HRI Lucas asked about whether the city can share the issue with us? That question is about what will be the pressure on the price of each product line in the future, then the market price movement, whether the company will see that the price of OLED products will rise and become more intense.

I think the downward pressure of each product line has always been there. If you look at the OLED part, you will see that there is an increasing pressure on the price here, because the whole OLED phone, in the last year, the whole penetration of the whole of the OLED phone should be close to six percent, that is, the OLED is already a mainstream display technology, so the IC design companies want to come to this area of the display, so the overall competition is actually a bit more stressful.

So, let's start by asking KGI's Lucas Liu about the evolution of OLED TDDI products and the outlook for future growth. This question asks our Chairman to answer. Well, OLED TDDI has a lot of competitiveness on the wear and overall look at the demand on the market is also increasing, and that should be a pretty good line of sight on OLED products.

Thank you for your response. The question was raised by Yuanda Anthony Lau, and the question was about whether there was room for improvement in penetration rate for key mobile phone customers this year. The question was about whether there was room for improvement in penetration rate for key mobile phone customers this year? Is there an opportunity for new customers in key mobile phone customers this year?

Above. Thank you for answering. The question was raised by Lucas Liu of KGI. The question was about whether the company should update the folded mobile phone condition and the penetration rate of the general mobile phone is improved? The question was asked by our chairman. We already have a product on the folded mobile phone in mass production, the new models in the customer group will continue to import again, and overall, we think that this year the weight of the folded mobile phone will continue to increase. Above

Thanks to the Chairman's answer. The next question was raised by the grand Antony Lausso, which is about the increase of manufacturers adopted by RAMBES OLED DDI this year, and the DDC manufacturers, such as joint use to increase the investment in such products, how does the company view the growth of RAMBES OLED DDI business and the price of this year's growth and the situation? At the same time, KGI's Lucas Liu asked the company to update the situation with RAMBES OLED DDI products, at present, how much RAMBES OLED DDI accounted for the company's revenue, what is the current situation of the product and what is the customer's feedback?

Since the overall mobile phone market will not grow too much, the penetration of RAMBES OLED has actually reached a 60%, and it is not easy to increase. If the demand for RAMBES OLED DDI increases, it is actually relatively disadvantageous for the overall unit price revenue. Above. Thanks to the Chairman's answer. Then there is the question about LDDI and PMIC T-COM.

This question was asked by the chairman of the board. The overall consumer products in the past year because of China's policy subsidies, there was a demand on the rise, and this year the DG also saw a continuation in this. The display of large-sized motor IC television and computer screen is better, which is more flat than the situation we see now. Thanks to the chairman's answer. The next question was raised by Yuanda Antony Rao, which is about whether the AIPC has upgraded specifications for Notebook, DDI, T-COM, and that question asked our chairman to answer.

Thanks to the Chairman's answer. Then, there was a part about the public charge in the car, which was asked by KGI Lucas Liu about the company's view of the car and public charge in the first quarter and 2025, and what can be built, and that Yuanda Antony Rao asked if this year's line growth is expected to be better than 2020, and the company more said that it was harvested in the U.S. or the mid-market car factory, which asked our chairman to answer.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription of the user and organize it into paragraph transcription. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided.

For example, the first paragraph may include a discussion about gross profit margin, followed by the Chief Financial Officer's answer, and then another question. I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or to the same speaker in order to correctly segment. For example, starting with "something has dropped", the next few sentences may belong to the same paragraph, discussing the change in gross profit margin.

At the same time, make sure that the structure of each question and answer is clear, for example, after the question is asked, answered by the corresponding person in charge, and then the words of gratitude, these parts should be kept in the original order. During the processing process, there may be some non-continuous sentences, such as "[1973. 64-1976. 40] domestic car public control oli plus", where there may be speech recognition errors or misunderstandings, but according to user requirements, the content cannot be modified and can only be retained as it is. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm whether these sentences are in the same paragraph and arranged correctly.

In addition, pay attention to the Chinese punctuation and sentence structure to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, after the question is asked, the answer part should be followed immediately, separated with the appropriate link or punctuation. At the same time, keep an oral expression, as this is a meeting record, which may involve repeating or stuttering, but the original statement must be preserved. Finally, check that the entire paragraph is smooth, without missing any sentences, and each question and answer corresponds correctly.

The following are the finishing paragraph verbatim transcripts (completely retain all the original sentences, only re-arrange the paragraphs according to semantic logic). --- There has been a decline. But in the long run, we believe that our public opinion on the vehicle is able to maintain a solid growth.

In addition, the company's automotive public control products have been used in various European and American domestic vehicle public control oli plus, and grew up in Christopher Taiwan monitor and linear above. [1983. 12-1984. 90] Thank you for the director's answer. Then it is the part of the financial figures. That part is answered by our CFO lumin.

First of all, KGI's Lucas Liu asked why the gross profit margin outlook and the change in the first quarter of this year, and what the gross profit margin outlook was in 2025. Yuanta Enterprise asked why the trend of gross profit margin trend, while Guotai Investment also asked why the direction of gross profit margin this year.

[2033. 64-2035. 64] Thanks to our Chief Financial Officer's answer. The next question was whether the company could improve the cost of Boundary and OCE by Yuanta Enternail. Zhang Jingyun of Cathay Investment also asked if the gross profit margin would benefit from the reduced cost of Boundary. This question asked our Chief Financial Officer to answer.

Above. [2079. 16-2081. 84] Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer. The next question was asked by Yuanta Enternail, what is the rate of fee this year compared to this year's year-round. Lucas Rowe of KGI asked what the operating fee amount or fee ratio in the company's first quarter was higher, and what the operating fee or fee rate in 2025 was higher.

[2111. 96-2113. 96] Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer. The next question was asked by Lucas Rowe of KGI about the trend of stock and number of days in stock this year.

[2138. 96-2140. 96] Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer. That question was asked by Zhang Jingyun of Cathay Post, what is our dividend distribution rate. Then ask our Chief Financial Officer to answer. As previously reported, this year's operating distribution rate was 80.2%. Answer [2155. 96-2157. 96] Thanks to the Chief Financial Officer's answer.

The next question was raised by KGI's Lucas Rowe, which is estimated at the company's tax rate for the year 2025. That's why we asked our CFO to answer it. Well, this part should be similar to Wang Min.

This section will be answered by our General Manager. It was first asked by KGI's Lucas Rowe about whether the company is currently developing new products or new market plans that can be shared with us. We asked the General Manager to answer that. Well, I'm going to explain in several ways. For the first part of the large LCD, we're continuing this Total Solution in Driver, T-COM, and this power management IC, and we're continuing to increase our number of projects and mass production.

The other part of the display, especially the high refresh rate 100, can support 120Hz or 144Hz of the application of our driver and T-COM, has been in mass production. In the case of OLED part, we have been continuously updating iterations, whether we wear, cell phone, fold, IT, etc., we are constantly updating iterations. That can improve the competitiveness of our products and performance, and the power consumption is further declining.

In addition, there are a number of new displays, such as the Cholesterol LCD, which is a Bistable display, which has a function of energy saving. And like the Micro-ID display, especially in terms of application driver IC, we have entered mass production and are currently developing a product for the next generation. [2350. 96-2352. 96] Thanks to the general manager for the answer.

The first part is in the OLED part, we have been in the mobile phone and wear this application area has been steady, and we also see that the future of OLED is more likely to grow in this area of IT and automotive applications, so we have invested a considerable amount of resources in this area of open layout. In the other part of the car industry control, we also continue to improve our product line, so that our product line can be more complete, and then I think our market share can be further improved.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph-by-word transcripts: [2423. 96-2426. 96] So we continue to work on integrated Total Solution. [2428. 96-2431. 96] In addition, like the information displays mentioned just now, such as the storage liquid crystals and Micro LEDs, we also continue to invest. [2436. 96-2440. 96] We hope to grasp the opportunity to grow in the future. [2440. 96-2442. 96] Thank you. [2445. 96-2447. 96] Thanks to the general manager for the answer.
