Hello everyone, today is June 12, 2025. Yutian Machinery Co., Ltd. Visitor briefings. Stock code 1539, I am the agent spokesperson of Tsong Tezhu. We are going to have our visitor briefings today.

The company was founded in August 70 and will be listed in February 90 of the following year. The products manufactured are the brand OEM of woodworking machines. The main export market is North America and Europe. The company's woodworking machinery products have automatic running machines, manual running machines, circular saws, single walkers, oscillating open sandbag machines, and other machines and equipment.

The use of woodworking machines is the design of general tools. The use of woodworking machines is widely used, mainly used in construction, home compensation, furniture, relocation, creative and amateur woodworking. The long-term cooperative customers cover dozens of brands, most of them in North America.

In the first quarter of 2025, the revenue of the automatic running wood machine was slightly changed compared to the second quarter of 2024. The design content of the automatic running wood machine was very obvious, and the proportion of the automatic running wood machine still reached 47%, and then the original convergence machine 23%, manual running wood machine 9%, and other products and accessories 21%. In 2024, the revenue of the product was 40% higher than the automatic running wood machine, representing a decrease of 8% from 2023.

Fengning Shao said that his wealth products are currently overlapping. In 2024, he once again added salt id, which accounted for a high proportion of oblivion in 2024. Europe accounted for 5.07 percent, while other parts accounted for 6.18 percent. Compared with 2024, in 2023, revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2024 was 1.3 billion yuan.

Gross profit reduction is due to a decrease in operating revenue. That is, gross profit margin of 11. 76% in 2024, up by 0. 49% compared to 11. 27% in 2023. As gross profit margin of 1.94 million decreased, gross profit margin of 11. 76% in 2023, but the production capacity of 2024 increased by 7.50% in 2023. In terms of operating experience, the operating experience of 5700 million in 2024 decreased by 23 million compared to the operating experience of 23 million in 2023, which is equivalent to a decrease of 28.77%.

The main reason for the increase is that the portion of business revenue in 2024 increased by 50 million from 2023. The main reason for the increase is that the portion of business revenue in 2024 increased by 50 million from 2023. From 2024, the portion of business revenue in 2024 will increase by 50 million from 2023.

Instead of saying private relieve. α سے, you first put the income platform. In 2024, the revenue of the automatic speculation machine decreased by 1 billion yuan in 2024, the rounding machine increased by 1 trillion yuan, the manual speculation machine decreased by 1 trillion yuan, the other products increased by 7.5 million yuan, a total of 2024 revenue decreased by about 1 trillion yuan.

The main reason for the decrease in revenue is low market demand, and the world's economy is low and low. In 2024, compared to the 2023 out-of-office revenue, interest income in 2024 decreased by 1.3 million yuan, foreign exchange interest in 2024, increased by 4 million yuan, the financial cost decreased by 25.5 million yuan, and the other revenue and expenditure increased by about 3 million yuan. As a result, the increase in foreign exchange interest in 2024 increased by 51 million yuan. The increase in foreign exchange interest in 2024, will depreciate from 30.075 yuan at the beginning of 2024 to 2.08 yuan, resulting in 4 million exchange interest.

The Q1 exchange rate was stable in 2025, and the exchange rate fluctuates significantly after May, and the Taiwan Dollar per meter in just a few days. That's why the company is particularly nervous and has implemented a new policy that focuses on the changes in the entire U.S. policy, as well as Trump's daily policy. And is prepared to communicate with individuals as the exchange rate changes are adjusted at prices above.

In terms of customer service, customers are more stringent about the management of their inventory, so the company's production plan has made a step forward. We plan production according to the customer's order needs to meet the supply and demand balance, and the company's stock of materials. Finally, the risk is the unknown risk in the market.

First of all, the addition of this tariff will increase the cost of brand imports, so it is bound to increase the selling price of goods in the retail market, which will affect the consumer's consumption capacity, and the frequency of replacing the purchase machinery.

Of course, customers are not able to make a smooth purchase, coupled with public deposits, which will also affect the future direction of customer orders. If Taiwan's tariffs can be lower than other countries, and the total manufacturing costs are lower than competing stocks, it may not be a total disadvantage for the company. However, our company should not put future assets on Trump's tariffs, because this is less realistic. It is important to enhance the competitiveness of the company, so the company will continue to develop new products, and this year will introduce many new products, hoping to stimulate the needs of customers.

In addition, our company also actively increase the processing qualification rate of accessories, in recent years, we have added CNC processing equipment, the goal is to be processed in the future, and the grinding made parts are in the field and can be completed. The above is the financial report of GT Machinery Co., Ltd. in the first quarter of 2025. Next is Q&A time, please share. If there are no other questions to ask, we will tell you a paragraph. Thank you.
