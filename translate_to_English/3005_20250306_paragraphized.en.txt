<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed in any sentence, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word.

First of all, I will read the whole transcription, paying attention to the timestamp and the corresponding sentence. There are many duplicate sentences in the transcription fragment provided by the user, such as, "Of course, in March we need to put a little more effort in order to quickly follow it" repeated. I need to confirm whether these duplicates are in the original text or possible input errors. According to the user's request, nothing can be deleted, so even the duplicates need to be retained.

For example, the introduction part of Mr. John and Mr. John Tse's CFO should be merged into a paragraph, followed by the annual operational status and outlook of 2024, followed by the introduction of the operating team, etc. At the same time, pay attention to the coherence of timestamps, to ensure that the time range of each paragraph is correct. For example, sentences from [0.0 00-1] to [1. 10-4. 26] should be merged into a paragraph, while subsequent sentences continue to segment according to the timestamp.

In addition, some sentences may cross multiple timestamps and need to be properly assigned to the corresponding paragraphs. During the process, also pay attention to the transition between speakers. For example, transitioning from Chairman of the Board to Mr. John Tse's speaking may require segmentation.

In addition, some sentences may belong to the same topic, such as discussion about the revenue situation in 2024, which should be merged together. For repeated sentences, such as those mentioned many times in March, they must be kept in all original order. This may mean repeating sentences in paragraphs, but they cannot be modified according to the user's request, so it must be presented as it is. Finally, check whether the entire paragraph typed text is smooth, conforms to logical order, and ensures that no original sentences are missing.

Mr. John Hsieh, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of the Board of Directors of Directors of Board of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of Directors of

In 2024 to 2025, compared to 2025 here, 2025 I just told you one thing we saw in 2025 should still be setting up a situation similar to last year's revenue. If we have a revenue situation in Q1, we think we can still be in that similar number, so we think Q1 is a good number. Of course, in March, we have to add a little bit of energy to follow it, then in March, we have to add a bit of energy to follow it, then in March we have to pick it up quickly, then in March we have to pick it up quickly, then in March we have to pick it up quickly, and then in March we have to pick it up quickly, then we have to pick it up quickly, and then we have to follow up with the next month, we will follow up the next month with the technology.

I think we all know that 2024 to 2025, especially after President Trump has a lot of things, then during the year there is also a deep sea situation, a situation to produce a situation. So if we have to pay attention, you should see that we are in today's next generation of a new generation of Intel new cpu, should I be wrong that it should be a new cpu of aero lag, then I think this is the latest generation of Intel core i ultra 2, then we may be not quite clear in the details, but anyway, there are also the most advanced Igpu computing power. So we all know that this brings some important technology or a few links in the industry, today will not play, but let everyone know, the first is known as knowledge distribution, the second is the moomiddle of experts, the fourth most important thing is to bring an openvironment.

In fact, at the end of the second quarter or at the beginning of the third quarter, we will have another new product, then he will be on top of the top of the top of the mpu, the top of the top of the mpu, he can meet the needs of the pilot plus. I think of the time to come to the computer time to see these things, and I agree with you, guarantee, that these things are definitely on top of the computing power in the industry, and that there is no other we are the only one. So we are some of these technology leading up, and then we have our own internal rnds, and in fact we have some good progress in some cooperation with the industry, and some isb in some of the operation we are relatively positive.

That's what I'm curious about, as a whole, is how you look at how your manufacturing base looks like. In fact, we've already told you about the fact that we're here with Silicon fat in our February announcement about 10% plus 10% of the erotic tax, and until this month there's another 10% of the tax. In fact, we've shipped a portion of the original from mainland to the U.S. Department in a very short period of February.

[384. 48-385. 60] We sent out the order directly from mainland China to the U.S. Department. [385. 64-389. 58] In February, we moved the order from Taiwan to 100% to ship. So we didn't have too many problems in this section. So, of course, I will tell you what the future looks like. [394. 68-397. 78] I will also report to you here.

In fact, we had a pretty good deal of practice before we were in midin europe. We had a lot of clients because of the need for a place of origin, so we actually had a lot of partners in midin europe where we all already have this practical ability. [413. 88-415.04] That medin usa had one to report to everyone before. In fact, we also have some partners in fact we even wanted to be able to be able to a lot more Guaranteee of our capacity on some of the more direct close partners. [426. 80-428.78] We are pretty much ready here. So we hope to be able to report on the right occasion in the near future.

[438. 00-440. 80] I came here to make it in different places. So here I think we don't have to worry about these things. That part of Terry will not affect gross profit at all. [447. 32-449. 74] I think we really have some direct practices.

But it is very small. [461. 42-465. 18] That's actually something we've already done to raise the price. There are a few different product lines, and so on. I think the g tag brand is actually even better in the past two years than the actual growth. [476. 58-481. 14] I got some recognition on the market.

I'm sure the brand on the g tag is one of the many countries around the world for Fortune 500 or one of the various government agencies. [493. 84-495. 84] We're on the market for some reasonable price adjustments that won't be too much of an impact. At the same time, I just wanted to tell you about the new generation of products that are high-powered. [505. 58-508. 78] Today we're going to launch a new one in the second quarter of the second quarter.

I think we've always been one step faster than others. [542. 12-544. 64] That's the fundamental and energy thing. In fact, we've been talking to you last year about this part of electronic construction that we wanted to grow 6-10%. In fact, we've done it too. [558. 12-559. 84] This is because the fundamental energy here has declined a bit more than last year.

[573. 92-576. 58] Low doses continue to last year slightly at the bottom of the valley. But it's still a little bit more than last year. We're seeing that base energy is a group of uh-we think can improve a little bye. [586. 72-589. 04] That's the overall view that we think he should have a single digit growth.

That is why I think we are pretty much ready in this part of the world. That's why I think it's the same thing that we did in Vietnam in February. [616. 44-617. 02] That's why I think we all know that in two years we've been producing a so-called china plus one china plus two if we just in case we need to buy a piece of land in Thailand two years ago. [633. 00-635. 28] That's why I think we're pretty much ready in this part of the world. [642. 00-645. 64] That's what we've done in the fourth quarter of last year, and I think it's not really good for the whole laptop industry. [656. 84-661. 08] That's the most important factor we didn't do last year to achieve 7-10% growth.

But we have to try to make it a similar number this year. [665. 10-665. 90] Well, that's what we've been doing this year, and we still need to make some investments on the side of Vietnam to make some expansions here in Taiwan.

And that's all there is to it. There are some other requirements for capacity. I think that we will still keep kpx between 10-15 billion by 2025. So we're probably. Overall, we're in a bit of capacity. And there's a bit of demand for some customers in the future.

I think we've done what we've just done right, so we've got to do it according to the needs of our customers. These are some of the necessary needs that we've put down in the production line step by step. That's the one we've made.

The floor area of that building is what we already have available. It is still in Vietnam there are still some plants in the lid. But I think it is also going to be about the stage of completion. Then there are some new products. For example, I put the composite material on it first.

That's some new words related to some of the laptop side. I think we've got them all too. So I think we've got composites this year. This year we've seen a situation where we should have the opportunity to grow to 8-12%. That's about 49-51 in the second half of last year's overall revenue. The situation we saw this year was about 46-48% on the lower side.

The higher the side is about 52-54%. So let's look at it as a whole. You can see that number. In fact, we have a very high expectation for a situation in the second half of the year. The overall focus is there. Of course, at some point in the world we all know now.

An international situation is actually a relatively high variable. That is, I think we should look at it relatively. Suppose everyone put the production line. anyway is now 20%. On that side. Some people still have to move the production line to another place.

We are still the last one in Vietnam. It is the only one. There is still no other in this field. It is in the field of manufacturing Rugged Computers. We are also very critical.

I think we are all very complete, that's going to come back. car season crossings this is a place where compares sad.

We wanted to say that we were able to keep a flattened as much as possible. The result of last year's result was a recession of about -11%. That year we still didn't look good on this field. That's mostly a real internal roll of this situation. That's what I think we've been selling snow to a very low place, and we're actually crossing this line in the car season here in Vietnam.

There are a few new singles coming out. We have seen a new factory. So we are still a little conservative. We are still hoping to be in a position to keep pace with last year. That is because last year there was a recession.

He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is not the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the only who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who

The second thing is that. Don't cause some more unpleasant results that could potentially Potential. For example, Bad Debt. Or go. Make your AR one of the intersections too long. After all, one is now.

One of the pressures of money is actually quite heavy. So we're still in this section. Think about a way we compare conservatives. We're going to automate them in the factory. We're in the new capacity section. Then the new product part is there.

There are many new products that can be done. That's what is called Domain Control. That's what is called a pre-controller here. There are still quite a few stories that can be done. So we encourage our business to be able to.

We were able to do some new development. Then we were able to gradually put some new products. Now this field stacks it up. That for you. We've been in the automotive field for years. The automation energy we've seen since is very impressed.

Our customers. Our customers still think we are. It is difficult to be replaced. So there is a bad situation. So there is a bad situation. Like us in Vietnam in the automotive field.

We have a bad one, but we can still grow. It's an accepted growth, so we keep a similar situation, so we're looking at it as a whole, so we're seeing it as a whole, and we see it as a whole this year.

This is one overall. And then here is the integrated project. We see a condition of a revenue. The condition. We hope to have a growth of 8-12%.

And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Qur'an as a guidance and a guidance and a guidance and an admonition, and a guidance and a guidance for those who guard (against evil), and a guidance and a guidance for those who guard (against evil), and a guidance and a guidance for those who guard (against evil), and a guidance and a guidance for those who guard (against evil), and a guidance and a guidance for those who guard (against evil).

That's just what we've just been reporting. Energy business group. We're in Hanoi, Vietnam, this part. February. We're on. So.

There is a beginning. That. This. The Rugged Computer Business Group is currently manufacturing a Taiwanese car. We are about to make it in the second quarter.

We will open a Taoyuan big IQ. That Taoyuan big IQ capacity will be better than that. The car manufacturer will be a little bigger. Some of the needs will come. Now in the car factory can also be the one that should be. But only a little.

That's why I think, the train manufacturer will give him a big IQ, and he will give him an hour.

There are not too many clients on the service above, that is, I think, the production line base, I would say that we should be in that regard. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****

That's what I predicted in 2025. We're quick match. It'll fall back on this side, so it's also because of that. The Fur material here is Maori. Oub said he's relatively low.

May is a bit lower than the rest of us. May will be a little less than our overall gross profit. Challenge a little bit. But I think we're going to stick to this. That's a lot of reasons I think. We can work together.

We assume that last year we did 300. 356 million. We assume that there is only one outstanding. An expectation to grow.

"We have to make sure that [the players] are doing the right thing, and that [the players] are doing the right thing, and that [the players] are doing the right thing, and that we are doing the right thing," he said.

That cost control, and so on. We see it as we've seen in the past. In fact, we try to pull it down. But if we grow up, it'll usually be a little more complicated. Then I think the CFO will explain it to you.

OK. That's a sustainable performance. That's it. Thank you for supporting our peace revenues over the years. We've continued to grow for 12 consecutive years. A simple number is 35668 in 2024.

The tax economy is 448. A friendly workplace. At corporate governance. No matter which corporate governance evaluation. There is also an index.

We were chosen last year by the newsweek, followed by statista. We chose the most trusted company in the world. It would be very surprising why we were chosen.

We are not the only ones who have the power to do this, but we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it, and we are the ones who have the power to do it.

I think we're in it. This is something we're still doing. The main thing is to make our company sustainable. It's sustainable growth. Thank you for your guidance.

We gave the time to the Chief Financial Officer. Thank you very much. From the investment to the rest of the afternoon, I'm here to report to you. A result of our 2024 year.

I'm sure we all know that this is the part of tea.

[1542. 10-1544. 46] The turn of the day is probably not too much. [1544. 46-1544. 86] [1545. 06-1546. 70] The portion of the goods. [1546. 70-1550. 06] In fact, there is not much higher. [1550. 56-1553. 30] This is a relatively high portion of the Fengdaco.

[1553. 96-1559. 72] That part of its total worth is 465 billion. [1559. 90-1563. 66] That part of this debt is 149 billion. [1564. 20-1566. 12] Or a level that is still low. [1567. 92-1572. 46] That equity totals 2.7 billion. [1575. 06-1583. 10] That on this just equity balance sheet, we just saw this. [1583. 10-1584. 70] The cash just said that there are also revenue accounts.

[1586. 30-1587. 32] The turnover rate part is 88 days. [1587. 46-1589. 62] Then the stock part is 96 days. [1589. 86-1592. 50] uh are quite flat. [1592. 60-1593. 96] The payable part is also 100 days. [1596. 90-1599. 82] The portion of the turnover to cope with the number of days of operation is 84 days. [1600. 00-1601. 22] Yes.

[1605. 06-1608. 30] Let's take a look at our equilibrium rate. [1608. 30-1609. 70] Our equilibrium rate. [1610. 02-1610. 82] equilibrium past. [1610. 82-1613. 82] We all equilibrium about 80% of this. [1614. 02-1614. 52] This year. [1614. 90-1617. 42] We also probably declare that we're going to allocate 6 dollars.

[1617. 42-1619. 26] So our interest rate is about 83%. [1622. 80-1625. 36] I think this should be the expectation of all investors. [1625. 62-1627. 52] It should be pretty much the same. [1631. 30-1631. 66] Good. [1631. 66-1632. 60] Here it is. [1635. 06-1637. 56] The above report.

[1637. 56-1639. 58] I don't know if you are advanced. [1639. 58-1640. 94. 94. 94] Can be further mentioned. [1642. 94-1643. 24] Thank you. [1643. 24-16464. 30] Next is QA time. [1646. 30-1649. 56] If you have any questions about advanced investing.

[1649. 56-1652. 40] can be written on the question list. [1652. 40-1654. 96] To our staff on the walkway. [1654. 96-1656. 78] If there is no question list. [1656. 78-1658. 38] We can also provide the question list. [1658. 38-1658. 76] Thank you. [1665. 06-1667. 06] Thank you.

[1695. 06-1697. 06] Thank you. [1725. 06-1727. 06] Thank you. [1755. 06-1757. 06] Thank you. [1785. 06-1787. 06] Thank you. [1815. 06-1817. 06] Thank you. [1845. 06-1847. 06] Thank you.

[1875. 06-1877. 06] Thank you. [1905. 06-1907. 06] Thank you. [1935. 06-1937. 06] Thank you. [1965. 06-1967. 06] Thank you. [1995. 06-1997. 06] Thank you. [2025. 06-1929. 38] Thank you.

[2029. 38-2030. 98] Thank you. [2030. 98-2031. 84] Thank you. [2031. 84-033. 22] Thank you. [2033. 22-036. 82] Thank you. [2036. 82-037. 84] Thank you. [2037. 84-038. 90] Thank you.

[2047. 52-2049. 56] Thank you. [2055. 06-2060. 30] I answered first. [2060. 30-2064. 00] There were a few investment friends here. [2064. 00-2066. 60] Investment advanced here mentioned. [2066. 60-2068. 78] It was later this year's ex-dividend date. [2068. 78-2070. 54] What is the main consideration?

[2070. 54-2074. 62] Because we allocated six pieces of money this year. [2074. 62-2076. 70] The actual total is also huge. [2076. 70-2077. 90] So we. [2077. 90-2081. 82] Because of the cash we put in our custody. [2081. 82-2085. 04] We must come from the following subsidiaries. [2085. 04-2087. 38] We are all after a quarter.

[2087. 38-2091. 06] There is only one way to add this surplus to each subsidiary. [2091. 06-2093. 26] Add it. [2093. 26-2096. 34] So we need some time to plan. [2096. 34-2098. 94] And we also need some additional funds. [2098. 94-2102. 76] May also need to make some adjustments. [2102102. 76-2106. 30] So this is our dividend this year.

[2106. 30-2108. 06] It may be a bit late. [2108. 06-2109. 30] But it will be okay. [2109. 30-2113. 94] It will be the fourth quarter. [2113. 94-2114. 90] It will be the other. [2114. 90-2116. 68] It will not be the same next year. [2116. 68-2118. 58]

[2118. 58-2120. 64] It is also about next year's dividends. [2120. 64212. 64] The condition of our quotas. [2122.2. 64-2126. 20] If that is the case, it is pretty much the same. [2126. 20-2130. 24] I think we will probably take a long time to plan. [2130. 24-2133. 40] That year. [2133. 40-2139. 56] There are no fundraising plans for capital expenditures.

[2139. 56-2143. 16] That's because we mentioned it just before. [2143. 16-2144. 88] Our capital expenditure for this year. [2144. 90-2147. 40] or between 10 to 1.5 billion. [2147. 40-2150. 28] Therefore, according to our current capital situation. [2150. 28-2155. 68] It should not be a need to raise funds yet. [2155. 68-2169. 28]

[2169. 28-2171. 08] Another investment advanced. [2171. 08-2173. 28] We are not planning to have M&A. [2173. 28-2174. 52] Well. [2174. 90-2175. 98] This part. [2175. 98-2181. 28] We are actually always looking for M&A opportunities. [2181. 28-2185. 90] Although we say we do not have some larger M&A.

[2185. 90-2189. 94] However, there are also some small M&As. [2189. 94-2193. 28] That is why. [2191. 28-2195. 56] If we see a better chance. [2195. 56-2201. 02] We will definitely be actively fighting for this M&A opportunity. [2201. 02-2201. 70] Thank you. [2204. 90-2209. 52] There are a few investment advances to ask about.

[2209. 52-2211. 90] Stop the war here in Russia in Ukraine. [2211. 90-2216. 14] One G4 budget order of that overall will not be affected. [2216. 14-2218. 32] I have already explained this to you here. [2218. 32-2222. 24] I think the first one we can see is the whole one. [2222. 24-2226. 52] We set up a fleet of drones. [2226. 52-2229. 06] He generates a considerable number of requests.

[2229. 06-2231. 82] This is actually not a war with Russia. [2231. 82-2234. 22] In fact, we do not think there is any relationship. [2234. 2234. 22-2234. 74] Because these people also think there is a relationship. [2234. 74-2234. 86] Because these people think we have a relationship. [2234. 90-2236. 78] This is the case. [2236. 78-2240. 74] Mr. Trump is on this case in Russia.

[2240. 74-2247. 02] In an actual U.S. military goods full of compulsive computers here. [2247. 02-2249. 06] We personally see it. [2249. 06-2251. 02] We think there is no related situation. [2251. 06-2255. 44] Instead, we believe in a case of a republican dominant. [2255. 44-2258. 48] Of course, they now cut the overhead. [2258. 48-2263. 06] But I think we buy our computer here to do Digital Transformation.

[2263. 06-2264. 74] It should not be too easy to waste. [2264. 74-2266. 12] On a level. [2266. 12-2270. 44] So we are seeing some of the possible projects that we have seen in the military at the same time. [2270. 44-2274. 36] In fact, the only thing we see right now is in the prestigious process. [2274. 36-2277. 98] Some of the singles and history have a bit of the New Year. [2277. 98-2283. 70] In fact, some singles, like Mr. Trump, etc., are deferred.

[2283. 70-2286. 00] But we did not lose that case. [2286. 00-2290. 36] We did not see some cooperation opportunities or some ratings. [2290. 36-2293. 20] Or opportunity, etc., some can cancel a situation. [2293. 20-2294. 58] So let's look at the whole. [2294. 58-2296. 20] We are optimization. [2296. 20-2299. 28] The whole stock market as a whole.

[2299. 28-2303. 00] Question. [2300. 00-2305. 20] One growth of the six to six to eight percentages of the Rugged PC in 2025. [2305. 20-2306. 58] What is a threat in the end. [2306. 58-2308. 34] We are still very optimistic about one thing. [2308. 34-2308. 24] Some of the needs raised in this matter are still the most important needs. [2312. 24-2306. 82]

[2316. 82-2319. 38] That utility has also been reported before. [2319. 38-2321. 58] Because of some. [2321. 58-2324. 42] The first is, of course, some power plants in Europe in the United States. [2324. 58-2328. 00] Or some of the relevant utility is actually old equipment. [2328. 00-2333. 96] It is something that needs some more of the buildings in power generation. [2333. 96-2338. 34] Those buildings will actually need some solid electricity in this regard.

[2338. 34-2340. 20] Some purchases. [2340. 20-2343. 50] We started last year in the fourth quarter until this year. [2343. 50-2346. 58] The utilities we actually see are actually growing. [2346. 58-2350. 66] The main reason they buy is of course taking advantage of this. [2350. 66-2353. 12] They take advantage of their competitiveness in digital transformation. [2353. 12-2354. 16] The main reason they buy is, of course, that they take advantage of their own competitiveness in digital transformation.

[2354. 58-2355. 08] Of course, the main reason why they bought it was to take advantage of this opportunity to enhance their competitiveness in digital transformation. [2355. 08-2359. 58] Whether the unit price of the Rugged Computer after the AI was introduced will rise.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments, sorting them into paragraph verbatim texts. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained.

At the same time, pay attention to repeated sentences, such as "these things are most important to you to increase memory twice in your influence above AGE AI, which must be retained as is, cannot be merged or deleted. In addition, some sentences may not be smooth due to speech recognition errors, but the user requests do not be rewritten, so it can only be retained as is. During the processing process, also pay attention to the continuity of timestamps to ensure that the timestamps of each paragraph correspond correctly. For example, [2359. 58-2365. 78-2369. 50] and [2365. 78-2369] both timestamped sentences may belong to the same paragraph and need to be merged.

In addition, the user mentions a paragraph-based verbatim, which means that a logically related sentence needs to be combined to form a coherent paragraph instead of a sentence sequence. This requires determining logical relationships between sentences, such as causation, contrast, or supplemental explanations, so that a reasonable segmentation can be made. Finally, after completing the initial draft, I will read through to check if any sentences are missing, to ensure that all contents are correctly classified, and not in violation of the user's requirements. If there are uncertain places, it may be necessary to re-arrange the original verbatim to ensure accuracy.

Like the previous standard configuration could be 8GB of RAM. Now we talk about 16GB or more. Now we talk about 32GB or even 64GB and there is even more demand. Those things are the most important thing is that you add memory on your AGE AI influence. Those things are the most important thing is that you add memory on your AGE AI influence.

So when we see the overall selling price above, I think he is a unit price SP will increase. Of course, we would also like to see the gross profit margin rise. Then we can actually just look at the Chief Financial Officer to report a front. You can see that gross profit margin is definitely an opportunity to increase the maximum value of our investors.

That's the one we've been supporting for years. That's the one. There's the one that makes Handong's BPU that doesn't ship to AI Server. We're actually in this field earlier. CSP or the SERV company needs a demand right now. That's the one that's relatively small in terms of quantity.

A good domain actually has a few more different applications that he can use. So thank you for that step-by-step reminder that some of our colleagues will come back.

Let's take a look at it. Now that synthesis is not a chance. Enter that SERV Component. Or some of the drones actually exist. SERV has already sold some of them.

The price of mechanical parts is relatively low. We are not in this regard. There are not many major manufacturers. So, we have some performance but only a few.

A gross profit situation can also certainly try to grow. That is the case for the whole of us. That is 34 billion dollars in revenue right now. That is a very low percentage. That is also the case.

There is an opportunity for good development. We have been able to see it all the time with advanced questions about the visibility of our robust computers. This is a relatively large topic in fact, what we have been seeing is definitely visible above Focus. 3 to 6 months. We have been developing it since last year.

We hope we can make new so-called precise marketing. Visibility can be extended for a long time to a year or even longer. We through this. More than a year ago, some practice POCs were related and waiting for us. Back to marketing we have officially dumped it in the first quarter of this year. Using a lot of advanced AI tools that also allow us to develop some marketing expense.

Efficient and we are. Because we all know that this is the life of B2B. That is, for example, for Fortune 500 I did a very simple description. Fortune 500 assumes that the US 500. Out of the US assumes that the Fortune 500 is 1000.

The second one is the one who does not do good, but only the one who does evil, and the one who does not do evil, and the one who does not do good is the one who does evil, and the one who does not do evil is the one who does evil.

We don't want to. Back-blooded marketing is something I have some advanced tools I can do with a lot of related AI. We don't know customers and then we don't know them. But we also developed it from a process like this so we think we can at the moment.

Through the development of this year. Some of the updated courses are our past. We call it newname account. It can help us create so-called mental growth. That I think. It is better to face actual growth in performance.

There is also an investment advanced here. Aerospace fasteners Maori. From 25% of 3Q in 2024 to 28. 16%, but the company overall Maori. From 32.06 to 31.85. That takes into account this depreciation product.

This is what they are asking about, and what they are saying about it, and what they are saying about it, and what they are saying about it, and what they are saying about it, and what they are saying about it, and what they are saying about it.

He is one of the most powerful of us in the world, and he is one of the most powerful of us in the world, and he is one of the most powerful of us in the world.

There are some combinations. That is also included in us. The whole number. The proportion of BG. The proportion. The expression.

So, although. Although the performance of space here is only good, it is because of its proportion, it is 10%, and it is also relatively small.

We are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world; we are like the rest of the world.

"We have a lot to offer," he said, "and we have a lot to offer, and we have a lot to offer, and we have a lot to offer.

This year's forecast is about us. We all think that every BG will stay on top of them. It's just the average share of this business.

And they shall be gathered together unto one another, and shall be gathered unto one another, and shall be gathered unto one another, and shall be gathered unto one another, and shall be gathered unto one another, and we shall be gathered unto one another.

And when it comes down to it, it comes down to it, and when it comes down to it, it comes down to it.

I think the cost of the future marketing will remain at this level in 4Q, I think. The cost of the marketing is probably here. Yes, the level remains the same, but when the revenue rises, the price of the marketing will certainly be a little bit.

That is, that our IQ is very high. I focus on these costs in this so-called marketing. One control with one. The promotion of business so we will look at the situation in this market. Do some things here.

Some marketing strategies. If so, sometimes we'll be slightly higher, but this shouldn't be so different. There's another step ahead and there's another question to ask.

There are a number of changes in the number of shares, and is there a number of changes in the number of shares, but this should not affect our profitability. There are digital and investment advanced questions about whether Trump's disapproval of the fees is causing some decreases in the number of troops? I'm still here and see that the information is not diminished. In fact, what we see is that we can create new singles, and this is what we see at the very least a growing situation for us as a whole.

Another company has a goal for Rugged Computer 3-5 years brand market, which is a Marshall problem. The market share we have now falls between 20 and 25%, because there is no clear way to evaluate the same agency, but we want to say that we want to add it to 30-35%, which is the same evaluation method, which is the growth of our own market share. The growth of that market share is a very important place for us, because you are a brand awareness really recognized by the market, just as I have just told you, some of the projects in Europe that they will be named us, is one of the only one of the only, we really follow ourselves to establish a brand and reputation in this regard.

In fact, we are not the oil machine, we have a long-term business development strategy since 2021 and 2022, based on the overall market situation, we have to explain it, such as kanemoto marketing is one of the major opportunities to expand business. We have re-imported AI into our products this year, so that's why we can see that we do not introduce AI products, so we assume that we have two products on the market in the third quarter.

This year, we will continue to maintain the cost of this year, but this is because we have just mentioned the problem of the proportion, so if the combination of this expense rate, we think that if Huang Dong said that the establishment here we will actually grow a bit better, then if this growth rate is relatively high, then it may be that his proportion if the tensile tension, in fact, our expense rate will decrease. Other words, we are probably in the BG above every BG price rate hope that each BG can decrease slightly, but if the combined fee rate is a share of our business. If there is a relatively large increase in the establishment here, then the cost rate is relatively low, as I said, because from 2022 to 2023 this proportion is a step up, because we are the stronger part of his proportion, but because of the growth rate of this year.

Thank you very much for the advanced age of investment, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
