Well, thank you all. Today I want to talk about a situation throughout the third quarter. In fact, the third quarter of this year, we see the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. The number of our revenues is a bit higher. That in the green part, 23.5% is the region of Asia, and it looks a bit smaller.

In fact, if we are in the Asia-Pacific region, then we are in the middle of the region, so we are in the middle of looking at the whole region, with a regional market view, it will be the strongest in the Asia-Pacific region, then it will be more of this seasonality, then it will be a performance of the European region. In 2025, because the war part is not much, there is no disability, so 2025 outlook, the performance of these three regions will be more like this. Then we will see that in the Asia-Pacific region 51. 2%, it is the main proportion is because you will see it in the next section of the PC, it actually accounted for 27%, so if you say that the only 51% removed this 27%, in fact, the PC market of the PC is a little bit bit of the PC.

In fact, in the fourth quarter of this week, last week has released the entire fourth quarter of the top 1, which you can say is that from the beginning of the fourth quarter to the end of the fourth quarter, our quarter to the end of the fourth quarter, revenue for the year is all growth, that is, 2024 compared to 2023, regardless of which quarter, if we see the whole year to see, revenue for the end of 2024 has increased 10% than revenue in 2023, where 10% of the part of the PC is probably about 9% of the situation, that in the old stock is more than 10% of the range, so the overall view is that we are in line with what we are talking about, because our new business is lower than the whole base enterprise, so in the whole we are expected to compare with the total annual revenue of a household, its revenue is more than the year of the year to a year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year is a year of the year of the year, the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of growth, that we are only part of the only part of the only a little little more than that we have a little bit more than that we have a little more than the year is a little more than the 2023. 8% in the third quarter of 2023 this figure, in fact, is just a part of the inventory, because we have too few in 2023 have some inventions of the Rail, so it will later also have some inventions of the reversal, that is, it will be sold in the end of this Rail, and then it will be sold out so there will be some reversal, so the third quarter of 2023 will be why 10.8%, it is partly because of this inventory relationship, the proportion is not very large, so it does not appear that in the third quarter of 2024 this situation, so it seems to have a slight decline in gross interest rate, but in fact, it is mainly because of the 2023 inventory relationship, which looks pretty much the same as above Approved Income Margin. **Please note: ** ** ** ** **Note: ** ** ** Note: ** ** **

That's just the outer part of the job. I just said it because if it were true, it would take a long time to see our part outside of the job. This impact figure is that the foreign exchange portion will become more comparable. Not so much volatility. That's what our company contributes to.

That's the part of our company's EPS. Although we have a number in season 4, you may be interested in the so-called dividend distribution. Even though Acer doesn't have a clear indication of how much our dividend distribution will be. But we've been here for years.

In fact, the distribution of our dividends is probably more than 80% compared to EPS. So we also have a very clear view of this part. But we are still looking forward to 2024. This proportion is at least 70% of what we think we can do.

That's what we're talking about, in fact, most of our company is flat. That's what we see in a table. That's what we see in a table. That's what we see in a 28-quarter situation. And then on a one-night net rate. In fact, in the first quarter of this year, the first quarter versus the last quarter.

We all have a relationship with CLT. We actually see a slightly different profit situation in the first quarter. In the second quarter, there will be a relatively low situation. So there will be a relatively rapid climb. By the fourth quarter, we will say that overall can be said to be in a high interest rate environment.

They're on top of the stock for sale in the fourth quarter or the fourth quarter. It's a little more conservative than the third quarter. Because most channel operators don't want to stack this stock for the next year. So overall, they'll find that it's actually the third quarter in two years and four years. It's a bit higher than the fourth quarter.

In fact, in the balance sheet, Acer's corporate balance sheet is more directly related to the entire working capital. So, in my opinion, most of the parts of our cash will be directly connected to the Working Capital. That's when you look at the end of June and the end of September, you'll see a significant increase in cash.

And then we see a big downturn in our payables. That's because the day that we made it to the end of September was actually a holiday. So we made some payments that we didn't pay. That's going to be like a big fluctuation. In fact, it's because there's no vacation problem. And most of us are.

But I don't have any numbers at the end of December. But overall says we're all going to fall in stock. Especially, we're already falling in stock at the end of June. Whether it's the stock of the finished product or the stock of the key components, the stock of December will fall significantly.

That's just part of working capital. We've also seen a downward trend. That's what I've just said. There's another analysis of the product. That's probably what this third section is all about.
