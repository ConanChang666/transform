<think> Ok, now I need to process the script of the user and organize it into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, can only adjust the punctuation, line change, and paragraph merge, while keeping the original order and meaning.

In addition, it is necessary to fill the appropriate punctuation at the end of the sentence using Chinese full-form punctuation. You can't change lines in the same paragraph, you can only use empty lines, each section recommends 3-6 sentences, subject to change. Next, I need to analyze the transcription provided. It looks like this is a meeting record of a corporate briefing, including a conversation between the host and the speaker, as well as some technical content.

First, I need to identify the speaker, such as the "host", "external co-op", and keep these logos. Then, check that each sentence's punctuation is correct, whether there are missing periods, commas, etc. For example, the user has many sentences in the original text without punctuation that need to be filled. Next, I need to merge the content of the sentence into a natural paragraph. For example, the host's opening part may need to be merged into a paragraph, introducing the speaker and the meeting process part as another paragraph.

In addition, some sentences may not be coherent, such as "[138. 24-139. 70] push," need to confirm whether it is a typographical error, but according to the user's instructions, can not modify the content, can only adjust the punctuation and line. It is also necessary to pay attention to the processing of time stamps, the user's original text in the timestamp, but the finishing of paragraphs do not require timestamps, so it is necessary to remove. At the same time, ensure that the speaker's identity is properly preserved, such as "host:", "outside selection cooperation:", etc.

For example, professional terms such as "ethanol", "returning ethanol derivatives" must be preserved in its original form and cannot be modified. At the same time, pay attention to the correctness of numbers and proprietary terms, such as "55. 8%", "2002", etc. Finally, check that the entire finishing text complies with all the requirements of the user: no delete anything, the punctuation is correct, the paragraph nature, the subject switching place is separated by empty lines, each paragraph 3-6 sentences.

[0. 00-2. 60] Good luck to you all. [2. 60-5. 50] I would like to go to the current minister here. [5. 50-9. 40] A spokesman for our intermediaries here. [9. 40-12. 40] I would like to share with you a statement of the company's progress. [12. 40-14. 70] Our online market conference. [14. 70-18. 20] The invitation to our spokesperson is to cooperate.

[18. 20-20. 60] and Jiang Zhongwei of the Finance Department. [20. 60-23. 20] Jiang is also an agent spokesperson. [23. 20-27. 20] I think the next word is to give us time. [27. 20-30. 00] The spokesperson here communicates with you about the investment. [30. 00-33. 00] After the introduction of the company is carried out. [33. 00-34. 50] There is a column on a record.

[34. 50-36. 20] Then ask questions. [36. 20-37. 20] Thank you. [37. 20-38. 70] Thank you for your cooperation. [38. 70-40. 70] Good. [40. 70-42. 90] All securities investors. [42. 90-46. 70] There are also analysts of investment entities.

[46. 70-47. 70] Hello everyone. [47. 70-52. 50] Welcome to our first quarter. [52. 50-55. 20] The legal person's briefing session of East Union Chemicals. These sentences can be combined into a session to introduce the host and speaker of the meeting, as well as the meeting process.

This section may require a separate section, as the theme is switched. Then the company introduction section, including the time of establishment, capital, product line, etc., needs to be segmented, each section 3-6 sentences, to ensure that the theme is consistent. Finally, the processing capacity expansion, investment structure, and other technical content, also need to be segmented to maintain consistent theme. Throughout the process, it is necessary to repeatedly check whether any sentences are missing, the punctuation is correct, and whether the paragraphs are rationally separated.

I would like to invite our spokespersons from this area to tell us a statement from the company. If we were to meet on-line with our spokespersons, we would like to invite our spokespersons to join us as well as the Department of Finance. Mr. Jiang is also an agent spokesperson. I think the next thing to do is to give our spokespersons time to exchange with you.

After the introduction of the company, there will be an episode of a record, so please ask again questions. Thank you. That's another trouble, thank you. Hello.

That's why I wanted to do this first. I'm stuck, sorry, our PPT is a little stuck, we have to take 30 seconds to fix it. Can I see the screen now? It's hard to wait. Can I see the screen now? It's hard to wait. Can I see the screen now?

Can you see the screen now? Can you see the screen now? ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₹ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₸ ₪ ₸ ₪ ₪ ₸ ₸ ₸ �� � ₸ � � ₸ � ₸ � � � � ₸ � ₸ � � � ₸ � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � ₸ ₸ � ₸ � � � � � ₸ ₸ � ₸ ₃ � � � ��

Well, let's start today's corporate briefing, just to introduce you to the company. East Union Chemical was founded in December 1975, 2025 is the 50th anniversary celebration, we will hold a series of related activities in the second half of the year. Our capital has 88.600 million, not 10 billion, so we have some follow-up to the specifications of listed companies, we still apply a standard of less than 10 billion capital. The company is mainly the business we want to do, but we started to do ethylene glycol, that is, 1G, this is the largest product when set up the factory for a long time. Of course, we also found that about ten years ago, we began to focus on the raw materials of ethylene glycol, that is also the part of oxygen, we began to transform.

At present, we are focusing on regenerative ethylene oxide derivatives, which are specialty chemicals and gases. The 1G portion is still in production, but in the case of the Taiwan Kaohsiung Forestry Plant, the 1G ratio will gradually decrease. This part of our joint Yangzhou Plant, I am waiting for a more detailed introduction, it is also the direction of regenerative ethylene oxide derivatives. Finally, we hope to reach the 1G of Kaohsiung Forestry Plant, which accounted for about 10% of our revenue, which is our goal in three years.

Ethanol is the most important component of the gas business, and we need oxygen in the process of ethanol and ethanol, so we build our own air plant, which includes nitrogen, extra oxygen, and rare amino acids, all of which we sell throughout the gas business.

We have a number of projects that we have been working on since the board passed last year, including EA, EA, the ethanol saddle, we are doing the work of Tze Ping Well, from 40,000 to 60,000 to 60,000 tonnes, which will be completed in December this year. The second part is the EB, Ethanol, and we are doing the work of Tze Ping Well, which will be expanded from 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes to the end of this year.

There is also another HPEO, not above, is the high alcohol epoxy, this part is from the bottom of our golden six towers and then refined, into high alcohol EO to expand the utilization of our finished product, this part will also be completed by the end of this year. There are three plans for this project we are going to work on, and there are two other tanks to report with you, the first is the safe tank, this we have built for many years, this year will be the third year of this case.

There is no real fire. Well, there is another thing worth mentioning, that is, the West of this tank, I believe that you have seen such a construction of this news in this news media, will be completed in the second quarter of this year. This is our main source of raw materials in the West, so most of the now is by the oil pipeline process, the self-built tank, the self-intensity, we will import itself, the relative cost is a good construction.

That 2024 annual revenue is 23.7 billion yuan, an increase of 3 billion yuan compared to 2023, an increase of 14%. Operating gross profit is 10.90 billion yuan, an increase of 76.0 billion yuan compared to 2023, an increase of 225%. The sales share of the three major field of view can be seen here: Ethanol part is 63%, specialization part 31%, gas part 7%.

The net profit attributable to the parent company in 2024 is $0.20 billion, a decrease of $0.40 billion compared to 2023, mainly because of the sale of land in the port area in 2023, profit of $7.4 billion. EPS is $0.02 per share, which does not distribute dividends this year. The total assets of the combined assets are $3.4 billion, which is 78% of the production vision and 22% of the investment vision. By the end of 2024, the debt ratio is 58% of the net worth of the shares.

I believe that the end of these developments is in line with the ESG carbon reduction goal. That is, from the point of view of the first upstream raw materials, we are petroleum chemistry, the downstream of the petroleum linkage of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the petroleum of the chemical industry, so how to use these green materials is a direction for the upstream integration.

In addition, after carbon dioxide purification, we sell the industry-grade, food-grade, and semiconductor-grade carbon dioxide market. In particular, it is worth noting that this part of the market is not large, but that we have such an ESG concept of the product, which is welcome for the semiconductor industry, and then we will continue to add our customers in this direction.

I just mentioned this section, we are about to import our own safety, which is a big help for us to develop a series of safety products, on the one hand can reduce the cost, on the other hand, this volume of this expansion, we can develop more safety series products, which is also widely used. That said, we are talking about this goal of carbon reduction, so it is very easy for me to say, of course, in our efforts every year, the goal of carbon reduction in 2035 and 2040 is to reduce the carbon neutral by 35%, and the goal of 2050, we have not changed.

Did you end up seeing it? Below is a tank he has a question, do you see it? I want to read it? Long Hui trouble you read it, we didn't see it. Well, I read it, there is a free loan problem in the tank, he mentioned the price of the G&E of Green MCA, and then there are the prices of both of these products.



"This is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the wicked, and this is the way of the righteous: walk ye in the way of the righteous, and walk in the way of the wicked.

What is the west, the west, the east, the west, the east, the west, the west, the west, the west, the east, the west, the west, the west, the east, the west, the west, the east, the west, the west, the east, the west, the west, the east, the west, the east, the west, the west, the east and the west?

The West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West; the West is a part of the West.

We have not done well in Western tanks yet. The amount of imports to the West is flexible. But it is small. It is heavy. Because of the takeaway. The project is.

For example. We are biased. Generally speaking, it is a semi-complementary. Philos Philippines feels a lot special. It is possible to go to the UTD.

This year is expected to be positive or a reference range. The regulatory expectations are roughly what. I'm here to answer. The entire existence of the two has continued to lose since 2019, mainly because of the excess capacity relationship.

There is no way to reflect the total raw material cost. It has improved significantly after two or three years since the beginning of the previous year. Last year has a better performance than this year. But if you want to achieve a loss level, it will take a while. After all, it is still too much capacity. This year and last year should be better than last year.

What to say. Because of the whole. Last year. Last year the instrument cost was relatively high. That was because there were some new production capacity this year. So the total instrument cost estimate will be revised.

This is the case. The relative profit of the two will be better, although there is no profit, but the loss of the situation will be slightly reduced. The above answer is good.

Thank you. The chief of the wealthy review. I don't know anything else. In the end, there is no problem. Also, Mr. Song of the Federal Lettering. He.

Q. Please continue the QA or the report. Because the two business ministers report. Ask when the assistant has said if two come. The report on the relevant business will be explained with the investment. That's not to say that there will be the relevant report or the QA. Yes.

We asked the senior manager of Chen Zhechuan for a report on the raw materials of related products in the West. Well. This page is the whole situation of the WTI and NASA. That said, this year the entire oil price continues to go down. So many institutions have revised the entire WTI oil price.

It is estimated that this year is 70 pieces of $70. Even if someone estimates 65. There are many subsequent variables. This is an estimate that is used first. It is easy to use a description of a few slides later.

NASA oil price is 70 pieces. NASA is 630 pieces. It is estimated that the whole west is 850 pieces of money. That's the price to see. Look at this BAR.

The cost of a whole listing is still less than its cost of $250. So 25 years seems quite hard. Next. That's a description of the entire supply and demand and supply rate in the West. That's the new capacity added to the West this year in Asia. It's estimated to be 6.5 million tons.

That's one of the whole west. The total supply is more than 200 million tons. So it's not much of a new capacity of just 6.5 million tons. In fact, there's no mention of excess supply. But most of its new capacity is concentrated in Asia.

The next expansion is estimated to be between 27 and 28 years. At that time, the whole western raw material supply will be more relaxed. Therefore, the entire operation rate will be seen here.

The overall run rate is 77%. It's a bit worse than what's going on next year. Good for next year. That's a bottom-up product. Only LDP is profitable at the moment. All other downsides are not profitable.

The page is based on the above estimates of the price of the entire two. The one and two are estimated to be 520 to 530 levels. The two are in terms of supply and demand. 24 to 25 years is mainly orally the price. But compared to 23 years, there is a significant improvement.

24 25 years of relative slowdown. The whole situation will. Look at the slowdown. But in these two years, it is still in excess. It is good to mention that the whole existence is slow because the whole new capacity is slow. But the decline in the west part will be faster than the one.

So 25 years in one or two industries should be a few improvements compared to last year. That page is the profitability of Western products. That page is the whole cluster industry chain. Includes the situation of flat and long-line short-line. POI is a long-line PSF is a short-line. Now see that the green part is the main loss of flat.

For the past two years the whole supply has been oversupply, so the entire industry is unable to make money. Instead, the POI part is profitable.

We are thankful to God for His grace. He has given us the opportunity to pray for those who have lost their lives. He has given us the opportunity to pray for those who have lost their lives, and to pray for those who have lost their lives, and to pray for those who have lost their lives, and to pray for those who have lost their lives.

So there is a lot of hope that the entire development strategy can replace the traditional one or two. Then do not be affected by import or foreign one or two. But recently it has been discovered that every one or two has a serious environmental problem. There are other aspects of transportation. So the whole industry is no longer encouraged to continue.

So it should be less and less. It is now open or is in production, so it will be later.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the scripts provided by the user and organize them into paragraph format. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten or condensed, can only adjust the punctuation, line change and paragraph merging, use the Chinese full-form punctuation point, and each paragraph 3-6 words, the theme to switch the time period.

First of all, I will read the whole transcript to understand the general structure and theme changes of the content. It looks like the content involves a lot of topics such as productivity, cost, revenue forecasting, cost, electricity consumption, etc. Next, I need to identify the parts of each speaker, such as "Jin Bing", "Lin Baotou", etc., to ensure that their speech is correctly segmented.

According to the example provided by the user, it seems that the timestamp has been omitted in the finishing paragraph, so it may be necessary to remove the timestamp and keep only the content. Next, handle the punctuation symbol. The user requests to use the Chinese full-form punctuation point, such as ". "," "!," and fill the end punctuation point. For example, "So the new production capacity will be put into production and there will be more production capacity than the past" after the punctuation, there is no punctuation, need to add a period.

For example, if you want to combine sentences as a natural segment, you may need to combine multiple related sentences into one piece to ensure logical coherence. At the same time, pay attention to topic switching timesheets, for example, when transitioning from capacity discussions to revenue forecasts, you need to separate empty lines. There are also multiple duplicates or redundant sentences in user-provided transcripts, such as "We want to look at 2021 compares" repeated three times, and one sentence needs to be combined, but according to user requirements, nothing can be deleted, so it may need to be retained, but combined into a paragraph. Finally, check whether the format conforms to the requirement: do not change lines in the same paragraph, only empty lines, each paragraph 3-6. Make sure that no Markdown format is used, only output plain text.

During the processing process, there may be some uncertain places, such as the processing of timestamps, or whether some sentence merges are reasonable. At this point, the user needs to judge according to the context to ensure that the original intention is not changed. For example, the user refers to "expected growth in gas revenue", followed by multiple questions, needs to merge the relevant questions into the same paragraph, maintain the consistency of the question and answer.

But the cost of coal is not the basis of the Qinhuangdao or the coal price we see. Because it is only $200 or $300 from the country of origin, the price of coal shipped to Qinhuangdao by Qinhuangdao may be 600 or 700. Therefore, the cost of coal is usually estimated to be about 450 to 500 pieces of money, which is the current production cost of the whole coal.

How does it work? It all depends on its use of coal, perhaps it can take the coal to power it, or go to coal to do something else. But this is not a coal-based derivative of 20%, or its application will do such a trade-off.

The reason for this is that the policy may not have a high operating rate, and that is because the entire process requires regular overhaul. These causes cause the whole coal to be 20% of the current, although it may be flat or a little profit, but there is no way to open very high. At present, the operating rate is about $200, so its price is also around 70%.

It is not easy to grow what you say, because the whole Taiwan market is saturated, and there is a limit on the production capacity of our plants. So the gas we see is a more balanced situation. Well, then, he continues to ask, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

The cost rate should basically be almost the same as the past, because even if you have the old equipment depreciation, you will have new equipment to start depreciation. So basically, it should look like, these years is about to maintain a fixed level of depreciation. I would add that the three major businesses are just asking this part, and the gas part, if there is no new equipment or the input of new capacity, the depreciation should not be improved. But the specialization part, if there are new equipment, etc. investment, and then there will be a new depreciation, then it will be slightly improved.

Then he asked whether this year's budget goal or exercise, is expected to return to the level of 2021? 202, to give strength 2021, is expected to return to the level of 2021? This year's budget, I want to 2024, we have a more bold, this aggressive forecast, the growth of revenue will be, but this year's 2021 comparison, we want to take a look at the 2021 comparison, we want to look at the 2021 comparison, we want to look at the 2021 comparison, what is the 2021 level, 2021?

If you are looking for a company that can help you achieve your goals, we can help you achieve your goals and achieve your goals. If you are looking for a company that can help you achieve your goals, we can help you achieve your goals and achieve your goals. If you are looking for a company that can help you achieve your goals, we can help you achieve your goals and achieve your goals. If you are looking for a company that can help you achieve your goals, we can help you achieve your goals and achieve your goals.

In addition to just talking about some of my own in-house equipment, can improve the ability to save energy and reduce the use of degrees, and perhaps the use of their own power generation, which is currently in the discussion, of course, there is a more popular topic, such as electrolyte symbiosis, we are researching inside.



<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the user's request, sorting a script into paragraphs. First, I have to take a closer look at the user's request. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, can not be rewritten, can only adjust the punctuation and line change, consolidate sentences into natural paragraphs, use Chinese full-form punctuation points, and use empty line segmentation, each paragraph 3-6 sentences, the theme switching time period.

First of all, I need to check the transcription content provided. It looks like a conversation at the end of the meeting with multiple speakers, such as the dragon emblem and the host. The original content provided by the user is separated by timestamps, and I need to merge these sentences into a consistent paragraph while keeping the original and order. Next, I need to make sure that each speaker's part. For example, the part of the dragon emblem begins with "Sorry I interrupted" and ends with "I'm all".

I need to make sure that each speaker's speech is correctly grouped so that different speaker's content is not mixed together. Then, pay attention to the use of punctuation symbols. Some sentences in the original sentence have no punctuation, such as "above" may need to be added.

For example, "we can still receive more than one good order" may need to be divided into two sentences, or adjust the punctuation point. Also note that timestamp processing, user request output does not contain timestamps, so you need to remove these parts. At the same time, make sure that each paragraph does not exceed 6 sentences, and the theme switch between the paragraphs. For example, the speaker and the host should be separated into separate paragraphs. Finally, check to make sure that all the missing sentences are merged correctly and that nothing is added or deleted.

Make sure the sign is correct, use the full-shaped sign, and the paragraph is separated by an empty line. After the completion, read again to ensure that all the requirements of the user are met. </think> We can still receive some good orders.

If you have any questions, welcome to call me or e-mail me. Well, if you have any other questions, I think that because the meeting time has been more than one hour, and they have another meeting to open, we are going here today. Thank you for your participation.
