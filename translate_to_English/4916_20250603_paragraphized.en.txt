The following is a re-edited paragraph-by-text transcript:. Welcome to join us today. We are glad to have you all attended the seminar of Shixin Technology Co., Ltd. Today, we are talking to Mr. Liao Wenjia, former President of Yen Chunggung, Vice President of Wu Xiubi and Manager of Li Shenlong. The meeting will be divided into two parts. The first part will be the chairman of Shixin Division and share the company's recent advantages and operating results.

The second part is a Q&A session. Then we're going to pass on our time to the officers of Shixin. Managers, we can start. Thank you. We welcome you to invest in advance to participate in the online briefing session of today's Shixin Technology. Today's briefing is here for you.

I think today's briefing is roughly divided into five parts. The first part is a water epidemic of our last two years and the first quarter of this year. The revenue in 2024 is about 3.57 billion, a 4.66 percentage growth compared to 34.1.4 billion in 2023. The gross profit in 2024 is about 5.59 percentage growth compared to 47.78 billion in 2023. I think the gross profit in 2024 and 2023 is about 14.15 and 14.02, probably at 14%.

However, the gross profit portion of 1.800 million grew about 24.66 compared to the same period last year. The gross profit margin was about the same period last year 15. 25 this year 21.52. It also brought a net profit attributable to the parent company about 620110 million. The gross profit margin in the first quarter of that year, as well as the net profit margin in the business and the net interest rate after the tax period, generally presented a situation with an increase in salary and growth in the same period.

I think this part is for everyone to invest in. Then take a look at the announcement of the earnings as well. The other part reminds you of the fact that the most recent two years are related to the most recent three years and the net profit loss in the first quarter of this year. The total assets we merged this year in Q1 are about 37. 79196, which is about $30.9196. The share price is about $15.3.6 billion. I think this part is mainly a month-to-month and a profit benefit of the first quarter of this year's CB.

That is why we have increased our interest in this shareholder. In May, we have a 500 million CB. That is, for our regular borrowings around the earth, when our 500 billion is in place in the middle of May, we have made a full payment before May 20. The debt is about 32%-33% compared to our first quarter of the year. This debt is a significant improvement compared to the previous year.

In addition, after the CB position in May, the cash on our combined account and the balance available to us by the bank, I think we should have the flexibility of 1.6 billion. This part is more than enough for the company's future debt ratio to rise. That part is where we enter the year's dividend formula. We will still have a stake in the company's operating profitability and the allocation of funds as well as taking care of shareholders.

This is just a comparison to the financial numerals. It is a relatively general aspect of the company's operations, so it is easy and quick to tell you just mentioned last year's revenue of 35.7 billion, which is about Q1.57 billion this year. The five product lines we focus on are aerospace defense and national defense medical and industrial applications.

That was also the year we got it because the U.S. Department of Defense required contractors to do a security-related certification and to obtain the relevant defense-related military business. This course we also got it. I think that this is to help us to win more space-related medical and military-related performance. That part I think is mainly divided into four sections. In 2012, the new US IPO was set up in 2013. In 2012, we completed a merger of three U.S. companies from 2012 to 2017.

I think this is because the relationship between 2012 and 2020 has been affected, but after the adjustment of the operating income of the outbreak, we have gradually resumed our operations and profitability from 2022 to 2024. That in 2025 and the year ahead, I think we are still committed to a organic growth and the stability and profitability of this operating performance. So I would like to briefly point out that we have two operating locations in the United States in Mexico, and now we have another new site in the future.

That allows us to quickly adjust our operational productivity or a dynamic adjustment of our customers. Our response is very fast. So I think this is for you to read it again. This part of our entire group of products is mainly developed with a small number of different kinds of products in a customized order.

From the number of lines from its plate and one assembly of various product lines, whether semi-finished or finished, can be applied.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure there are no omissions or errors. For example, note that there are duplicates or intervals between some timestamps, such as [655. 08-656. 36] and [656. 40-662. 54], a mobile device with a 0.0 04 second interval in between, may need to confirm whether it belongs to the same paragraph.

It is important to note that some sentences may have an interval between timestamps, but the content is coherent and requires a reasonable segmentation. At the same time, it is important to pay attention to dealing with errors or inconsistency in timestamps, such as [746. 32-750. 16] is actually also a large profit and advantage, here there is a timestamp interval, which may need to confirm whether it belongs to the same paragraph. According to the content, this sentence should be followed after the previous sentence, so it needs to be merged into the same paragraph.

For example, [1155. 90-1157. 90] the future and [1157. 90-1158. 90] when we are very clear, etc., which may be a question or a background noise in the Q&A session, need to be kept in the final paragraph. During the process, also pay attention to the consistency of the sentence to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, in the context of Trump's policy, it may be necessary to combine multiple relevant sentences into a paragraph to maintain logical consistency. Also, pay attention to the correct order of timestamps to avoid confusion. Finally, check for any missing sentences or timestamps to ensure that all content is properly converted.

For example, in the final Q&A section, the user mentions the advanced investment questions that need to be sorted into paragraphs separately, keeping the original timestamps and content. In summary, the whole process needs to be carefully checked for each timestamp and corresponding sentences, ensuring that nothing is missing, and at the same time a reasonable segmentation makes the paragraph verbatim easy to read, while retaining the original information altogether. </think> The following is a paragraph-by-text transcription (fully retaining all original content, without deleting, rewriting or condensed any of it): Aerospace defense, game and related game entertainment systems, or medical, or networking, and this mobile device.

I think that there is a good profit and a stable business here. It is a good advantage to use one of our North America in LA and Mexico to make 100% of the North America, and that I think the timing is right now, and that's exactly what Trump wants to bring back to the U.S., and that's why I think the business should be in the U.S. early and Mexico, and that's why I think it's a really big profit and advantage to us. That's exactly what I want to be able to do with one of the major clients we've come across, and that's what I want to do with it.

I would like to think that this part of the new world of production is actually not handled by companies in the United States, so I think that this part of this exercise should have a relatively large impact on our ability to enter this industry. I think that this part of the new world of production is actually not handled in the United States, so I think that this part of the new world of production should have a relatively large impact on our efforts in North America, and we have a team of experienced North America, and we have a serious acquisition of tires or defense medical care in various industries, and Q1 recently our professional expertise, and the need to get CMNC is part of the cyber security, that we have also got.

This is a supply and demand situation that is expected to be around 2030 for you to refer to. The final I think that the North American layout has been largely completed, and I believe that in the future or all years of 2025, we hope that the operation of the new world will continue to be profitable, and I hope that today's report will end, thank you for your participation. Thank you for your wonderful sharing, and if there are any problems to communicate with the leaders of the new world, please use the chat function below to ask questions, thank you.

I want to invest in advanced UAV projects this year, and President Trump of the United States of America visited the Middle East and signed a 160 U.S. dollar flight order. I think this should be an information on UAV projects this year. I think this part of our answer is that we and our customers have signed an MDA to explain it to a single customer, but we do have received approval from the aviation industry, I think we have already passed, the initial purchase of this order is expected to fall in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, so next year's contribution should be in accordance with the customer's arrangements, we will maintain close contact with the customer, we are cautiously optimistic about the development of a subsequent order.

In the past, most of these commercial drones were manufactured in China, so the U.S. banned the adoption of drones in the U.S., and the recent U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. A U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. drone was originally created, and the recent U.S. U.S. U.S. U. U.S. U. U. U.S. U.S. U. U. U.S. U. U.S. U. U. U.S.S. U. U. U. U.S.A.A.A.A.A.A., and U. U.S.S.S.S. U. U.S. U. U. U.S. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. A. U. U. U. U. U. U. A. U. U. U. A. A.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E. A. A.E. U. A.E. A. A. U. U. A. U. U. A. A. A. U. A. A. A. A. U. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A.

Good. Well, there are investment advances to see if there is a continuing rise in the interest of the U.S. Department of Defense, which was previously predicted by the U.S. government's efficiency sector on budget spending and personnel impact, we have observed a slowdown in supply chains and customers, but in May 24 Trump once again said that according to the U.S. dollar defense budget, we are still prudently optimistic about a trend to follow-up orders, and I think that is what we understand right now.

Thank you for your interest in our company. I think there will be bribery in our US dollar assets in the second quarter, but the progress of the US dollar is not too big, should be within the controllable scope, we expect the EPS of the single season to be around zero, which is the estimated value, and the value of the approximate dollar to our current impact.

I think we want our gross profit margins to remain a relatively high standard this year, and I think we want our gross profit margins to be adjusted from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2009. The other quarter we want to make money every quarter, and I think this is my goal for our colleagues. So of course because of Trump's tariff impact, I think that this is a lot of profit for the company's U.S. manufacturing, but because the right to the overall tariff is going to come out in July, so many of our customers are still looking forward.

ury ت is a progress, I can one or many people feel that their cause is their positive possibility, and the proportion of products is generally weak. I think our products in the first quarter of this year is about 32% in aerospace and national defense, the broad range of the part about 22%, that in the gaming part should be 21%, then the medical part about 11%, and Nabisco about 8%.

The following is a rescheduled paragraph verbatim transcript: It is about 33% of that space and defense industry. That I think is a situation that maintains a fairly steady growth. These numbers represent a product application for the first quarter of this year and are expected to have a market share of about 3 percent this year.

Besco is about 3%. These figures represent one of our product applications for the first quarter of this year and an estimated market share of about 3% this year. The current possible product proportions represent one of our product applications for the first quarter of this year and an estimated market share of about 3% this year.

There is an investment advanced question: what is the downward trend of a new Mexican plant. The new Mexico plant is our second plant. The main plant is just finished. It is expected to be put into production by the end of the year. We are still downloading the product section with our customers. There may also be some capital expenditure.

A production line that is going to invest in new electronic manufacturing. So this new factory in Mexico should start making a production by the end of the year. Because now is the first half of the year.

We have a lot of difficulties lately. We have a lot of difficulties. The area is broken. A lot of difficulties. We have several points. The first one is our client's niche.

This is the only defense industry in the U.S. that will be manufactured by the Taiwanese factory. This should be the only defense industry in the U.S. that will be manufactured by the Taiwanese factory. The defense industry must have this certification. This was later obtained in California. This certification was later obtained in Mexico this year.

So our factory can make an order for this national defense industry. This is a niche market. Focus on this part.

Another is a smart implementation of our production line. We also use this so-called AI technology. It is the technology of our own wages. He does eye-opening computing to introduce some applications of AI.

Another should be the introduction of automation. The introduction of automation can reduce our costs. Why can we do great to 20%? Is there a need for automation. Other companies also invest a lot of this robot as well as this equipment for automatic optical inspection. On top of our manufacturing process in the United States.

That's why we're using a lot of the company's resources to reduce the cost of our manufacturing. That's why we're able to make a movement to maintain high trade in the United States. Thanks for sharing with the chairman. Thanks for sharing your time with the president.

Thank you all.
