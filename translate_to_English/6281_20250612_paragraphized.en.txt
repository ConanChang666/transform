<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text from the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I need to read the user's request carefully to make sure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original word must be maintained. Next, I check the verbatim text provided by the user verbatim, paying attention to each timestamp and the corresponding sentence.

First of all, I will identify different speakers or topic conversion points. For example, starting with the host's welcome, then introducing the presenter, and then starting with the presenter. Each section may need to be split into different paragraphs. At the same time, pay attention to the continuity of the timestamp to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural.

In addition, be aware of the accuracy of the numbers and percentages to avoid errors during the merge. In addition, the "Irresistible" in the "Impossible Inflation Trends" mentioned by the user may be a typographical error, which should be "force majeure" or other correct vocabulary, but the original text cannot be modified according to the user's requirements, so it is necessary to keep it as it is.

At the same time, make sure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, in line with the logical process of speaking. After completing these steps, submit the final result to the user.

We are pleased to invite Mr. Zhao Yijun, the Director of the National Electronic Finance and Accounting Office, to be the presenter of this legal person's briefing session. Next, we will pass the time to Mr. Zhao, and thank you for your interest in investing in advance. Thank you for joining the online conference of today's electronic. We will start today's briefing.

The Group was listed in the Republic of China in 1994. As of the end of May, the total number of stores is 327 and the total number of employees is 1616. We are part of the 3C chain of home appliances industry.

We can see our total turnover this year, the national electronic sales of a variety of 3C appliances, such as household appliances, electric ice-cream washing and cold-cleaning small appliances, such as vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, electric cookers, ovens, iPads, and so on. We can also see that we have announced the annual turnover of NT197.89 billion in 2024 last year, of which the total turnover of household appliances is NT180.37 billion, accounting for 91% of our total revenue. We can see that this year's turnover of NT197.89 billion, and the total turnover of information and other goods is NT17.5.2 billion, accounting for nearly 1 percent of our total revenue.

The gross profit margin of that business was 21. 19%, a decrease of 1.1% from the same period last year. It was mainly affected by the excruciating travel budget, resulting in a decrease in the buying price of our overall market and a slight decrease in the sales function. But we continue to optimize the senior commodity portfolio. Then we saw that the operating expenses of this period were about 800 million, which was reduced by about 10 million compared to the same period last year.

In the first quarter of that period, the operating profit was $1,34 million, a decrease of 7.02 percent from the same period last year. Finally, the net profit after the loss of the business was deducted from the income tax, and our overall net profit after the tax was 1,80082 million.

In the first quarter of this year, the liquidity of our assets decreased by 1.74 billion compared to the same period last year, mainly because our bank deposits increased by 390 million, which decreased by 467 billion. We will moderately regulate the water level of our inventory with the bank's condition. In accordance with the past conditions, our stock levels will be higher in the first half of the year due to our bank's peak season and will be gradually degraded by the second half of the year.

Last year, the distribution rate of cash dividends was 88. 7%, which has been very stable in electronics, and EPS maintains a certain level. In the case of shareholders' dividends, the distribution policy is mainly based on the distribution of cash, and the payment rate of dividends is still more than 80%. According to the stock exchange statistics, the overall yield of Taiwan stocks is 3.94% since 2014, and the average yield of Taiwan stocks since 2018 is about 3.83%. The company's stock price is also very stable, compared to the average stock price of each year, the average cash yield of the past five years has been more than 5%.

In the first half of 2025, Taiwan's total economic growth forecasts were lowered from 3.15% to 2.91%, mainly because of the domestic economic situation in April, due to the slowdown in the U.S. tariff impact.

The current measures for the reduction of energy-efficient appliances and the consumption of goods tax have also been cooled due to the continued volatility of the financial markets. The implementation period was to June 14th, but the Legislative Yuan will read three amendments to Article 11-1 of the Goods Tax Ordinance at the time of June 10th, indicating that the implementation period of our energy-efficient appliances and goods tax reduction measures will be from June 15th to December 31st of the Republic of China. At that time, the reduction of post-execution tax is only until June 14th of this year, but this policy will continue to reduce the maximum amount of goods tax of NT$2000 for these appliances.

Looking forward to the future, there will be a lot of uncertainty in the future, such as Trump's government's frequent policy of adjusting tariffs, negotiations, and peer-to-peer tariffs to expire for 90 days. The growth forecasts of the major economies of the next autumn 2025 reflect that the global economic outlook may be conservative. The future economic trends may change. That is to say, if the global economy continues to be under pressure, Taiwan will still face the challenges that both internal and external need to be synchronised.

The Executive Yuan's headquarter also released the latest economic forecast on May 28, which will be revised to 3.1% under the GDP growth rate for the whole year of 2025, although still struggling to keep 3, compared to February of this year's 0.04 percentage points. In fact, such a statement has already reflected our growth momentum in the second half of the year is a relatively slow pressure.

The following is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcript:. Based on the analysis of domestic academic institutions, the timing of buying durable goods in the next six months is 97. 63 points, down by 1.59 points from the previous month. The timing of buying real estate is 95. 19, down by 1.66 points from the previous month.

This year's consumer demand is challenging if there is another growing demand. Therefore, for our overall 3C home appliance market, there is still a need to keep an eye on the development of flexible response. We are still faced with prudent optimism.

Now, let's take a look at our operational strategy. That's why the first business strategy we're going to talk about is the enhancement of the cell. Well, that's all the time, the national electronics is the main channel for physical stores. That's why the enhancement of the cell to enhance the quality of imported products and experiences is the main focus of the products we sell now.

The first time we had a brand new life with Life Plus, we also worked with a number of well-known brands in a variety of fields outside the home. From urban decoration, curtains, kitchen feeding equipment, floor, to the selection of paint, we will see in the next page, the super cool electric bicycle charging piles and other outdoor leisure goods.

3C home appliance life gives people enough time to lead the industry into a new era of comprehensive life service. Then we see that the second strategy is called virtual integration of digital transformation. From what we can see, the national electronics has been working on digital transformation strategy in recent years. An important group of digital transformations also includes the evolution of digital tools.

We have always had a way to respond to it. It is a great way to move into digital channels. Being able to embrace the generated AI, strengthen the data, collect and use it, thus improving the efficiency of our operations. In the first half of the year, the national APP launched, in the first half of the year, the characteristics of the goods are required for service professionals to be transported and installed, often requiring long-term after-sales service, decoration inspection and even cleaning.

As a member of LINE, we also use the push of LINE to deepen the connection between members and the national electronics. After all, the way we live our lives is almost the same as that of 3C products such as mobile phones. After joining us as a member of LINE, we will be able to receive occasional sharing of offers and send the latest news of digital products to everyone in a timely manner.

After all, the development of e-commerce has been a long time. So I hope to increase the consumer experience, can have a better feel, the operation of the interface, visual presentation, the speed of delivery. I hope to continue to improve further, and constantly optimize. Then we will see the third strategy is the sustainable development of ESG. ESG is the abbreviation of environment, social, and corporate governance, three keywords.

In the first half of this year, we can see that we are also working with the Huashan Foundation to launch the Dragon Boat Festival of Love, as well as the next page of the donation activity with us. We use practical actions to care for the vulnerable, the elderly or the low- and middle-income households, etc., and there is also a health screening of home appliances, such as checking the air conditioner fans and refrigerators.

In addition, the National Electronics, located on the outer island of Kinmen, has also cooperated with the local family welfare center to care for the disadvantaged people and set up flea stalls. Thanks to the friendly friends from all over the place to give you materials, and agree to the use of this family welfare center for charity sale. Then we see that this is the future, and it is also an ESG theme. Because we believe that technology can make life more convenient for the future, we also need to keep the environment and energy saving together.

We will also use our MIT washing machine to help children learn how to fold their clothes. You can also see that we have a guardian of sustainable ingredients, and we can learn to walk into the cooking classroom together, so that we can learn the knowledge of food preservation and cherish every bite of food.

In the first half of 2025, the legal meeting. That is still here and thank you for investing advanced participation. That's why it's so exciting. We still want our brand spirit. Can be extended from entity to network. Thank you.

We give thanks to the Lord for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy.

OK, I'm here to start the discussion, so I'm here to share with you all the questions I've come up with.

The first is that there are a variety of channels for consumers to buy. The National Electric Company does not have the physical advantage of storefronts. There is also a plan for the non-physical layout and outlook. I think this part. I just mentioned it in my operational strategy.

This is the part about our e-commerce. There is also our LINE push. There is the national APP we launched last year. These are the layout and prospects of some of our strategies. We are all in the process of growing up.

Now is all the channel market. Both online and offline for AI generation. All of these should be in the hands of the rest of us. So we are all in the electronic world. And also under the trend of such trends. We have been working on this part as well.

Thank you. Then the second question is: Ask the company's store plan. Is there a new store transformation plan? That's the part. Or we've all been there to keep our store planning.

It is said that we will continue to use this concept that is too weak to flow every year. Because we are of a durable type. There are some types of products. Our over-intensive shop will also result in a extruded effect. That is for the electric model of our DC store. It is about 10 to 15 ways to replace it every year.

Then the third issue is how much the contribution of the DC store is. The proportion of that online channel. That I think of this piece of data. I think of us right now. We are the use of our internal data to do a lot of important analysis. So it is confidential.

So I'm not going to reveal this one to everyone. Then I'm going to ask. The question is about the current situation of electricity and whether the store will continue to grow in the future. The number of DC stores is now 70. Ask how many DC stores are expected to grow in the next one to two years. The first thing to answer is this.

The first question to be addressed is whether or not we will continue to exhibit our electricity in the future. We have always been in the way of showrooms. As one of our most important business strategies, we will continue to work on this part of the DC store.

That's where the number of DC stores is now 70. That's asking how many DC stores are expected to grow in the next one to two years.

Then there is the fifth question. Do you ask the business outlook for the year to be better than last year. I want to say that I just started our business. Our strategy for the second half of the year has already been mentioned. There are still some observations in the land.

I think this part of the story. We will continue to keep an eye on future operations. We will respond flexibly. Prudent optimism faces. Thank you. Above all else.

Thank you so much, thank you very much, thank you all, thank you all, thank you all for your continued support.

I don't see any more questions here. The official explanation will end here. The explanation will end here. Thank you for your investment in advanced participation. Thank you all.

Ask for forgiveness, and ask for forgiveness.
