Hello, all old and new friends, welcome to join us today at the general health company sale. I am the spokesperson of the group Zhu Wenmin, representative of the company to do some briefings for you. You can see that this is the current overview of the company. We are currently part of the group in Taiwan.

Taiwan Business Group. We are very concerned about the American business group. That part of Taiwan includes Princes. Wang Pu is a company currently working with us in Singapore. He has four stores.

There are 12 pots and 12mini. There is another Wanxian. Wanxian is a company that we specialize in the development of retail channels. It is very hot green peppers on the market recently. Beef noodles are made by him.

I believe a lot of people. There are many. There are many. There are others. There are also outstanding. We are a company that invests alone. We hope to play the role of angel investors. The entire Taiwan business group is currently.

There are 347 stores. The most recent figure is probably about 350. Positive and negative three or four. But some people are asking now. We will increase the power of the store in the second half of this year. We hope that the number will increase again.

The other part is our mainland business group. We have a total of 88 stores in the mainland business group. Mainly the king goods. Steak and Western steak are the main brands.

Of course, a friend of mine recently asked me about a house. This is a new brand called Cloud Slope. Recently, it is very hot in Shanghai. He is a specialised in Yunnan cuisine.

As you can see, this is our investment structure. The main or the king's meal is more concerned in the upper right corner. We have a holding company in Delaware, USA.

Also we are in Texas. Register a company. If we have a good chance we will certainly. Go forward.

You can also see this. The current situation of Taiwan's whole vegetable industry. At present, it is. In fact, the year is growing. Of course, the factors of inflation are not excluded. But more importantly, the day of Taiwan really gets better.

Everyone is eating out. The demand is growing. So you can see that no matter what happens after a breakthrough in 2023, it will continue to grow in 2024. That's what we believe this year.

The whole food and beverage industry. The development is still gradually stable. At this time, the Taiwanese cuisine industry can be seen in the restaurant and hospitality industry.

The three of them were in the middle of the night, and the three of them were in the middle of the night, and the two of them were in the middle of the night, and the two of them were in the middle of the night.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [491. 32-493. 62] What are the main goals for this year? [493. 88-495. 42] is the three brands that can help red peppers and shrivells. [495. 66-496. 70] What are the goals of these brands? [497. 20-497. 98] Think about pressures. [498. 22-500. 78] and the three brands that shrivells can achieve a month-to-month revenue of $200 million.

[501. 04-502. 58] What does it mean? [501. 84-503. 86] Achieved billions. [504. 38-505. 90] What does it mean to our group? [506. 16-506. 94] We have at least nine brands each month to reach billions of scale. [507. 24-508. 26] What does it mean to our group's development? [508. 52-510. 06] There are nine brands that can reach billions of scale.

[510. 56-513. 12] How does this affect the development of our group? [514. 14-516. 96] This is very important to our group's attention. [517. 48-520. 30] So let us first mention these conditions here. [520. 80-522. 08] This is our main goal this year. [522.2 34-523. 10] What is the main goal? [523. 36-524. 64] There are no new brands.

[524. 90-525. 66] But the scale will increase. [526. 18-527. 72] The number of electrons will also increase. [528. 48-530. 54] This is our development in Taiwan this year. [530. 78-5332. 06] What is our current development? [532. 32-534. 88] You can also see from here our current number of electrons in Taiwan. [535. 40-536. 94] What is our current number of electrons?

[537. 18-538. 52] The number of electric currents in Taiwan. [538. 78-540. 82] The last two years were about 347 by April 30 this year. [541. 34-543. 64] The second half of our summer vacation should continue to strengthen the strength of our show. [543. 90-544. 92] What is the development of our second half? [545. 18-546. 46] We will continue to strengthen the strength of our show. [546. 70-548. 50] What is the impact of these developments on our group's development?

[549. 02-552. 08] Some of the options have already been completed and the contract has been completed. [552.1 34-553. 36] Some of the options have been completed and the contract has been completed. [553. 62-555. 92] Waiting for the entrance to the renovation. [556. 18-557. 98] What is the impact on the development of our group? [558. 48-559. 26] What is the impact on the development of our group? [561. 30-566. 16]

[566. 16-568. 20] I just wanted to report to you. [568. 72-572. 56] Although 88 shops, the main but mainly the Princes of the West are mainly the two main brands. [573. 08-573. 84] What are the two main brands? [574. 10-576. 14] The Princes of the West are the two main brands. [576. 66-578. 20] There is only one FernoSwan. [578. 70-579. 98] There are three Amigos.

[580. 76-581. 78] Rowang has one. [582. 04-583. 06] The cloud wave is the restaurant I just mentioned with you. [583. 32-585. 88] There are two. [586. 38-588. 44] This cloud-based restaurant currently has two. [588. 68-589. 72] How does this affect the development of our group? [591. 50-595. 86] The people are also very concerned about the operation of our continent.

[596. 16-598. 98] At the highest we have 154. [599. 48-602. 04] As the mainland economy changes to about 2023, we have fallen to 98. [603. 08-607. 16] How does this affect the development of our group? [607. 68-608. 70] About 100 scales. [609. 22-698. 28] But over the past two years, it has been as severe as the mainland economy that you are familiar with. [612. 80-615. 62] The competition in the industry is very intense.

[615. 88-617. 40] So we also adjust our positions in a timely manner. [617. 92-620. 22] How does this affect the development of our group? [620. 48-622. 78] So far there are 88. [623. 30-626. 32] Many people care about our development plan in China. [625. 34-626. 12] What is our development plan in China? [626. 42-627. 44] China's development plan.

[627. 70-639. 24] I am here to report to you that we will not have a significant expansion in the mainland temporarily. [631. 54-633. 84] We will not have a significant expansion in the mainland temporarily. [634. 86-636. 66] If there is an increase in two stores, it is possible. [637. 42-639. 48] But we must make sure that the economy in this mainland is stable. [639. 72-640. 76] What are the implications for our Group's development? [641. 52-645. 36] It is difficult to see the present situation of the big breakthrough.

[646. 64-647. 16] We must maintain a state of business continuity. [648. 44-651. 50] What effect these conditions have on our development of the Group? [652. 02-653. 56] We must maintain a state of business continuity. [654. 06-655. 86] What effect these conditions have on our development of the Group? [656. 42-658. 98] So the most important thing for us now requires that each store that survives be damaged at least one or two bottles. [659. 74-661. 54] Every store that survives must make at least one or two bottles.

[662. 04-6664. 36] It is best to be able to make money. [66. 86. 866. 666. 40] What are the implications for our Group's development? [668. 70-671. 00] What are the implications for our Group's development? [671. 52-672. 54] The mainland already has a small growth. [673. 32-674. 60] What are the implications for our Group's development? [675. 62-676. 38] Growing.

[676. 90-680. 22] It is also a positive growth situation in store revenues that we have seen in mainland China after 15 consecutive months of negative growth. [680. 48-681. 00] How does this affect the development of our group? [681. 50-682.2] The revenues of our stores in mainland China are a positive growth situation. [683. 04-685. 60] We expect him to continue to maintain it. [686. 16-688. 98] What is the impact of these developments on our group? [689. 24-690. 26] How does this affect our development of our group?

[691. 54-694. 86] So many stores within the volume are able to take care of themselves. [695. 38-696. 14] Every store is able to take care of itself. [696. 40-698. 20] We do not significantly expand. [698. 70-699. 48] What is the impact on our group's development? [699. 98-701. 52] What is the impact on our group's development? [702. 54-704. 60] But if you say an increase in two stores makes it possible to have a little more energy.

[705. 10-707. 16] What is the impact of these developments on our group? [707. 40-708. 68] What is the impact of these developments on our group's development? [711. 76-712. 78] Another thing that has been on the net for the past two years is our digital marketing efforts. [713. 04-715. 60] What is our digital marketing strategy?

[722. 30-723. 32] The number of members has reached 513 million. [724. 10-729. 22] How does this affect the development of our Group? [729. 72-731. 78] He has more than 50% of our revenue.

[750. 00-751. 28] Through this APP form. [751. 80-753. 08] allows us to better grasp the definition of consumer preferences and the economic condition of the consumer as a whole.
