Thank you for joining us today at the Falun Dafa Gathering. We would like to welcome you to Dr. Jiang Yun County's advanced friends, some new faces in the middle, and some friends we've met in the past. Let's take a look at the group, as we now have some of his PhD careers, some of his operations over the past six months.

In the past few years, whether the number of management or the construction of the case, in fact, they will be attached to the fermentation, which is the final project, because there is this end to our market size and its future operation, and there is a clean situation. This is a large market management, medium-level display is to save a page, I think for you, because the situation of the display in these years, it should be a medium-term industry down, but in fact, the display situation is not very good.

The last thing to do is to break through a big point, in fact, in this part of the energy, because the previous asset management is a big bottom project, that display is to create a long-term cash flow, then we want to create a future investment to do the energy of the part of the business, mainly you want to create a breakout, that is why you want to create a breakout of the energy this topic, in fact, he first we called the battery, but the battery we put a second time, we probably know that the battery should not call the battery, because the battery is the electronics industry is the concept of the end, that in the future, that no matter what electronic products you want to use in the future, it is the time to take these devices, is the electronic, so the battery demand, in fact, the energy demand is the energy demand is the more, the more, the energy demand you can not end, so through different tools to break out of the market, so that the market, that we will be able to build this market, or we are in the battery, we will be built a new battery, and we will we will be the battery, we will be the next next next next time, we will we will be more and we will not only a new product, we will be the next next next next next time, we will be the next, we will be able to provide a new product, we will not only a new product, we will be the next next time, we will we will be able to provide a new product, we will not only a new product, we will we will the next next next next next next next next next, we will we will we will we will we will not to the new product, we will we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will not only a new product, we will be able to the new product, we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will be the next time, we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will be able to the next next next next next next next time, we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will be the new product, we will not only, we will be the new product, the new product, we will be the new product, we will not only, we will not only, This number will of course look more and more interesting, the whole case, it is a construction period of about 4 to 6 months, it is a more special, it is a period of construction of a cycle, which is probably the business of the last year, so we can see the revenue is actually slowly but also a rebound of the state, then the green space can be maintained in a relatively good level, next we first talk about what our energy sector to do, next we first talk about what we want to do in the energy sector, first, we are basically a small number of companies in Taiwan with complete production line, that is a powerful and expensive factory, we have some consumer product lines in Taiwan, of course there is also, so it is basically a natural and safe state, so we try to do this negative state in the first class of our field, different categories, then we rarely do a relatively large point. **Please note: ** Please note that the full paragraph content is not fully rendered as a sentence, so that I can provide the full paragraph text. ** Please note that because the full paragraph content is not fully rendered as a sentence, please provide the full paragraph text. ** Please note that because the full paragraph content is not complete as a sentence, please provide the full paragraph text so that I can provide the full paragraph text. ** Please note that because the full paragraph content is not complete as a sentence, please provide the complete paragraph text so that I can provide the full paragraph text. ** Please note that since the full paragraph content is not translated as a sentence, please provide the full paragraph text.

The following are the paragraph type transcripts after the re-ordering:. Some of the most recent applications are in the later part. Because we are actually more able to accept one thing recently. Because we specifically want to always have a theme is the power loss price adjustment. Especially between the managerial style of the electric price difference between about two pieces. The last time we saw the digital industry about two pieces.

So the day tip should be said that the tip of the tip is about to reach 89 figures. This is the number of hope for the mid-level of the power station. So if this price difference is later, it will begin to ferment. So we also found that in 2025 and 2024, in terms of the three-year situation, you talk with guests and these so-called users of the factory to compare this later.

It is done by its own fire circuit and electric worker layer. However, it is true that fermentation will come from this part. Then we, the Taiwanese market, are a little smaller than us. So we have been looking for overseas markets since the beginning of this year.

So it's kind of like going a little bit faster, because the case is a bit more clear. So the US post-period is currently investigating one or two cases. So when he will, that's a bad thing. But these cases basically we have a lot of confidence in. Now let's take a look at this, and here I'm going to tell you a little bit about the big product we're doing.

This is the product that we are developing for our customers. We are working with a number of regenerative power plants in Taiwan to develop products for these customers. This is because it is used in the factory. As above, it is used in the factory, which is the product of the back cabinet.

So not every factory has a space to put a back cabinet and don't put it there. Some companies use a very good space. Then, like this one, it's an overpass station, the battery of EBOS's overpass station. Then we also have some more medium-sized products, which are also from B3 and overpass stations.

It is a new marketing product that we are going to see in the second half of the year when we talk about the development of new marketing. It is also installed at the intersection of many traffic dials in Taiwan. It is the product that we have developed in cooperation with our customers.

One of the biggest development progress is that we started out with a car product. One of the U.S. might not know about this car, this is the one on the right, the one on the right, the one on which we started shipping, and the first quarter of our delivery. So this is the shipment of car products, so the car product will not cost a bit as much as the last 12 months.

So we're really getting ready to ship, we're going to personalise our products first. That's not what we call a personalized product, it's what we call a consumer type. That's what it's all about. Toothbrush is a type of thing, and it's part of the long life cycle that follows the population.

Then we started shipping around the second quarter of Europe. Then we started shipping around the second quarter. Then we wanted to ship in fact not sure, but basically not sure. Then the main products of the whole product are brand makers, that is to do some personalized design. So it's a bit more relativistic to comment. So the biggest downside to the whole display is that we came here for the last few years of 2015 16 new cabinets to go to the market.

That's because we've had about 40% of the market in mainland China in the past. So after the pandemic, the mainland China is getting less and less. Now mainland China is basically a state of zero. So, because of the lack of a single fate, that revenue is not coming back. So even with these relative product revenues, it's a little bit weaker.

Then it may take a year and a half for it to start fermenting slowly. Then, because these products are developed after a long life cycle, it is a case of stacking. Then a case of stacking an case is added. Then this is a product of form gas. Then the third is a product of industrial gains.

That's because transformational planning doesn't have to be a successful thing at all. So before we start the transformation, let's start by creating a platform for a diamond fund. So we create this one that we think of as a fixed support within our plant to rent to use. So so far we have about 24,000 sq.m. about 8 thousand square meters of real estate that we are under control to rent. So this is a long-term, stable profit product.

That's why we need money to invest in batteries or storage cabinets. That's often the case after the rental rate in 2024. The construction and management services of this case are expected to be completed by the end of the new year. Then the market cap for the next quarter will start next year, and the case will be able to contribute back to a stable repair.

The case is currently under construction.

It's about half over until the end of May. That's where the back of the hardware will be built in the next few months. It's expected to be around the end of the year to be able to integrate the troops. The first quarter of next year is not a market and a cap. Well, after all, that's what we're looking for today.

So I thought we left time to QA, I don't know if you have any questions to ask, we can ask this first, then we use QA directly to answer faster. I don't know if you have any questions.
