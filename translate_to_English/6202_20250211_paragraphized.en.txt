Thank you to all your friends for attending the Fourth Quarter Corporate Delegation, 113. We are now going to start a legal meeting. First of all, please report to the Director of Financial Affairs. Friends of Corporate Delegation, we are still standing up to ask you to report.

We can see the selection of relatively variable turnover, although the turnover is almost the same as the previous year, but the gross profit margin is reduced by about 10 percent. This part mainly reflects some of the old treasury owners are clear, because the old treasury owners are relatively high cost, the overall market price must be high. Because of the market conditions, we will have some relatively low gross profit shipping in the process of clearing the main, because of such a change in gross profit, so we in the last year the overall tax after the loss is about 1.5 trillion, so the EPS in 113 years is -1.66, or 4%.

In the fourth quarter last year, the NIR was $6.92 billion, and the yellow interest rate was about 45, but we can see last year's fourth quarter we had a slight change after tax, about two million, mainly because we recognized other people's tax rates in the fourth quarter, and this part was in the fourth quarter. We can see a quarter of a horizontal sense, in the fourth quarter last year, 6.91 billion YY was 42% growth, and Q2 was 1% growth.

In the second half of last year, due to the lack of clear deployment of Neil, some internal adjustments were made, some of which were streamlined, including some of our streamlined measures for love and construction travel, to ensure that some of the effective development we left, while reducing the overall operating costs. So basically these reactions can actually continue to reduce some of our costs in the fourth quarter, so we can see that although the fourth quarter is still losing, but in fact, has already lost some of the accumulated losses. We were outside of the fourth quarter last year, in fact, there was a slight break, so the tax money in the fourth quarter was a loss of 38 million.

That is, in the year 113, there is no 125.5 million, that EYY is the province of TryCrate, that is about 38.5 million, that achieves about 40.3 million, the total cost of that year is about 12.400 million. The cost of this increase in our 113 year was slightly increased by 35 million, which just mentioned that some of our organizations and human resources were in the second half of the year some of the economic, one-time costs. The overall cost of this increase in our 113 year is in the industry, the selection is 236 million, the net income outside of that industry is 46 million, the net income of that the total tax is 1.25 billion.

In the past year, we have a lot of debt, which means that we have a lot of debt in the past year. Well, now this indicator can be a debt in addition to a loan, for Mai, the cost of enrollment, which is now strictly no longer possible in Japan. Then we have a billion short-term non-guaranteed loans with the bank, although this part of the borrowing is actually the current state of the company's funds, but with the bank still maintains such a relationship. The current ratio of current debt is about 28%, compared with the past 3.7%, the total debt is only 35%, not too high. With the following financial indicators, we can see that the end of 2024 has fallen below two months, which also reflects the operating condition of our customers in this area, and it may have some expectations in the past.

The distribution ratio is 208 times, basically normal. The above is the industry report here. Next I report the sales part of my business, first MCU sales, in the first quarter of 2024 is HOTEP's bottom, in the first quarter its turnover is only about 302 million, but from the second quarter, every quarter is stable at about 500 million, so the overall sales amount of MCU in 2024 is 1.8 billion million, compared to last year, compared to 2023, its YY is 9% negative.

So, according to its product characteristics, it is starting to climb in the second quarter, then to the third quarter is its rise, and then to the fourth quarter will come back. In 2024 POTEC's shipping chip, one of its shipments is 65KK, compared to the 43KK in 2023, its cost of gold, that YY is 44% positive.

Next, let's take a look at the advantages of TOUCHCU. Then the report is about security and security. That's the security part, 20KK in 2024, compared to 31KK in 2023, YY is a negative 35%. That's the negative, YY is the main reason is that Q1 and Q2 in 2024, it's too low.

Next, report on the health products part. Health products is a product that HOTCHECK has performed relatively well in 2024. That 2024 is the shipment quantity of 45KK, YY is genuine this device. Here you can see that from every quarter from 2023 Q4, Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4, basically every quarter is growing.

The number of shipments for that motor product in 2024 is 6KK, compared to the 5KK in 2023, an increase of YY is 29. The main growth momentum is in the tenth quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter, after the inventory depreciation of the customer, the order began to come in. Then we think that the motor will continue to grow in 2025. The next report is the social RF product. The number of shipments for that product in 2024 is 8KK, which is basically flat compared to 2023.

However, it can be seen that every quarter compared to 2023, except that in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, it is a relatively large decline, but in 2024 234, each quarter has grown, and every quarter has grown. So the RF should continue to grow in 2025, so this should continue to be a part of the trend of electric vehicle chargers. The next report is that the amount of chargers in 2024 is 6KK, and 2023 is 10KK, then YY is 40% of the negative.

The new national standard has been implemented until November 2020. So in this part of the charger, the performance should be reflected in 2025. Next report is the application proportion of each product.

First of all, the application proportion of Hot Tech is the largest or small appliance, its proportion is 22%. Then again, it is just mentioned that the performance is relatively good is a healthy two-sided product, its proportion is 45%. The display this piece compared to last year, last year was 8% to 10% this year. The main reason is because there is a new order in a power meter factory outside Hot Tech.

Thank you all.
