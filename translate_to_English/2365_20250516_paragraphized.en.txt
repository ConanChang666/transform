Today is Friday, May 16th, 114, and it's 2:30pm. The first quarter of the financial year is held, and I'm the Deputy General Manager of the Finance Office, Mr. Gao Anming, and I'm here to present the contents of today's briefing. The first quarter's business focus: This year, in the first quarter of 2025, the combined revenue of the company was 2.34 billion, which grew by 4.8% if compared to the first quarter of the same year.

In the first quarter, the company's budget is one of the reasons for the higher cost, because the operating profit of the company belongs to the parent company's profit amount is 16 million, which is a decrease of 54% compared to the same period last year. In addition to the decrease in operating profit, of course, the industry's revenue and expenditure is also slightly lower compared to the same period last year, just as the consolidated profit table will explain to you later. But if we look at the change in the third quarter, the portion of the operating profit is 3. 2 percentage points, and the net interest rate is 6. 8 percentage points.

In addition, the income tax fee in the first quarter is relatively high, because there are 5% of revenue tax for the unallocated earnings last year is about 1.5 million, so the effective tax rate for the first quarter of this year is about 32.8. First of all, the consolidated income statement for the first quarter of this year is about 4,8 percentage points, in the gross profit margin of 38.8, compared to the first quarter of the last quarter, the gross profit margin is slightly increased, so the total gross profit is 6.6 percentage points. In the first quarter because the cost of the first quarter is relatively high, so the operating cost of the first quarter is relatively high, so the final operating cost is about 8.4 million, which is increased by 14. 2 percentage points compared to the same period last year, so the operating profit is declining.

The gross profit margin of the first quarter of Maoli is 38. 84, which remains at a high level between 38 and 39, with a slight increase of 0.64 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year, which was about 0.4 percentage points lower than the fourth quarter of last year, but generally maintained at a high level of 38 to 39%. The profit margin is the extent of the decline, which is roughly the case with the fourth quarter of last year. Net profit after tax is also the decline of YY and QOQ.

In addition, we see the whole financial situation, the balance sheet here: the total assets combined in the first quarter of this year is 3.67.3 billion, that is, the current assets, the proportion is about 51.3, of which the water level of cash is 15.500 million, compared with the same period last year and the end of the year, cash is constantly increasing, accounting for 42% of the assets' earnings. That in the back of the revenue, the end of the first quarter of the year was slightly higher than the end of last year, mainly because of the increase in imports in March, so the revenue growth is slightly increased slightly. However, it is a good thing to see a better situation, is that the stock stock amount in the first quarter, the amount continued to decrease, which is a healthy situation.

In addition to the debt ratio and short-term liquidity, there is a good situation, the ratio of debt is only 13.2, and the ratio of flow and speed are all presented a strong level. Cash flow here is healthy, and the US stock cash is up to 7 dollars. So here is a major, the past three years and the first quarter, the profitability of operating with capital structure liquidity, and the cash flow to compare.

There are four core technologies in this region: the first one is the input device, the core technology, so we have developed the mouse keyboard and the handwritten input version of the product. One of the core technologies in the image section is the network camera and the driving recorder. The output of the product is the product associated with the speaker headset. The other one is the Bluetooth and wireless dual-mode technology, so we also use this technology to develop a series of dual-mode products, which will be introduced later this year.

The 2C-EBEA's 2C first is Copilot's product, which is called Copilot's product is the peripherals of AI, so this year we almost just listed the product, the keyboard and the handwritten input version of the product, and the headset part, we will have a Copilot key, and then let the user of the product can quickly connect to Microsoft's latest Copilot's function.

This year is an important year, and our products will focus on four key points: the mouse, the keyboard, the speaker and the headset. First of all, we have five design concepts: the smile design, the double-mode design, the ESG sustainability, the AI Copilot key and the ergonomic design.

The AI Copilot key is the Copilot keyboard that introduces AI, which allows users to quickly complete tasks at work. Ergonomic design is designed with ergonomic mouse for easy long-term use. In the keyboard section, the keyboards we introduced this year are all AI keyboards, and the AI Copilot keyboards are introduced.

In addition, both the entire keyboard itself and the keyboard and mouse are designed to be dual-mode, making it easy for users to choose from within a limited working area. In the speaker section, we introduced the new speaker this year, whether it is a single-key speaker or a 20-watt speaker in a wooden box, the Bluetooth feature has been introduced. In the headset section, we introduced a Bluetooth headset that is relatively high-end, which can last up to 8 hours.

In addition, we have also launched the GS series of GENES GAMING, a logo for our game products. In the game products, we have launched a rich product line, including the popular steering wheel part, the racing wheel has a transmission device with 6 wheels, and three pedals and a double motor upright feedback. This steering wheel allows users to have a sense of racing and experience.

In addition, we launched the AI mouse while being an ergonomic dual-mode infinite mouse. Sometimes the user was playing a war game, requiring a special style mouse, we launched the two-color grass-green mouse, so that the whole gamer has a more gamer and a sense of presence. In the keyboard section, we launched a mechanical backlit keyboard with RGB7 color glowing keyboard plus mouse.

In addition, we have launched a combination of keyboards, mechanical keyboards, and RGB7 color keyboards with mouse. In the headphone section, we have launched a headset that brings a clear sound to use, which is a game-like product. In addition, we will attend the computer show in Taipei, the exhibition will display a variety of AI Copilot peripherals, advanced Bluetooth devices, and eSports devices USB accessories, hoping to fully enhance the AI peripherals, so that AI PC users can have a more user-friendly experience.

#Q&A with Kunming Company. **As the host:** Well, we are now starting the Q&A with Kunming Company, which is first reported by the General Manager. **General Manager:** Good morning, thank you for your time to attend today's Q&A meeting. Today, we mainly report on the operation of the Q&A and the direction of this year's strategy. **Product Sales Portfolio**

First of all, let's take a look at the product sales mix for the first quarter. The first quarter of the mouse accounted for 26%, the keyboard accounted for 22%, and the input device accounted for nearly half of the total. Speakers and headsets accounted for 8%; the car recorder accounted for about 30%; the other categories of products, including a USB-related accessory, and the game-related products accounted for about 6.9%. **This year's strategic focus**.

In this section of the strategy product, I just mentioned a design of 2CEBDA, hoping to grow in the muted products, ergonomics and e-sports products, bluetooth headsets, Type-C and AI peripherals. ** Corporate governance evaluation** published at the end of April, this year's corporate governance evaluation score is 100 points, which in the last year 113 corporate governance evaluation score is 100 points, which in addition to the 112-year 90. 62 points, which is a further increase in the level of listed companies in the first 6% to 20% of the previous year, that is, that is, more than 112 years, the level of operation of the above 200 levels. **

At the end of the day, we are talking about an issue of operation, in terms of the environment of a market this year, there are a lot of opportunities. **Opportunity** The first thing to talk about the opportunity, AIPC here will lead the whole peripheral product business opportunities, whether from Garner or some other market research and survey agencies, you can see this year's institution, you can see the number of AIPC this year, and AIPC throughout the PC penetration rate has been improved, so relative to the number of AIPC growth, penetration rate will bring the whole peripheral business opportunities, so this year is why almost all new products in Kunming are introduced from the point of view of Copilot application.

In addition, Microsoft's Windows 11 will stop supporting Windows 10 after October this year, so all users must switch to Windows 11, where the upgrade demand is driven by a relative computer upgrade demand will inevitably have a stimulus and increase the demand around the computer. **Risk** Trump's policy part is mainly tariffs, the second is the exchange rate, and the third is the US bond, of course, tariffs mention that we are mainly selling here in North America, so the direct impact of tariffs is no, but indirectly affect I think that the entire export effect may have to be observed.

** Moderator: ** Thank you for the general manager's report, we are now entering the Q&A session. ** Moderator: ** Well, we are now finishing the conference today, thank you for your participation, we will see you next time.
