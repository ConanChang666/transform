Please follow the time to ask questions to our guests. Welcome to set up the Chief Financial Officer. Hello everyone, I am Chris.

Thank you first for the invitation to Yongfeng town and everyone's time. Just like before, it would take about 15 to 20 minutes. Let's take our first quarter of the financial situation first. There are a few outlooks we've made for this year's later.

This is the part of the factory where we had a new lease before. There are also a few brief instructions. The back will be about half an hour. If you have any questions, you can do some questions.

First of all, it is our first quarter. In the first quarter of this year, our revenue was about 12.80 million. It was an increase of 3.8% compared to the same period last year.

That's basically a level that we now have. Profits are probably around 1.46 billion and EPS at 1.84. Last year's EPS looked relatively high. There were 3.49. Mainly when we did a tax return last year at Q1. So when the Q1 income tax was a benefit last year.

If you exclude last year's income tax. EPS should be around 1.82. So this year's profit is a slight increase compared to last year's. So roughly, the turnover and profit are one increase compared to the same period last year. But not much. This is the quarterly review table.

One of the special events was last year's Q4 single season. Last year's Q4 we released a big message. We were in this idle land and plant in mainland China. It was seized by the local government there. Then there was a dispensation benefit. It was probably around 1.100 million.

So last year's fourth quarter EPS if excluded. Probably around 1.42. So this year's first quarter should be. It's a bit higher than the last four quarters. But it's basically the same as a normal one.

Our current financial assets are added to cash. Basically, our cash will make some investment related to financial management. So basically financial assets are with us in cash. We will look at it together. That's probably around $23 billion in the first quarter.

The same period last year was about 18,8 billion. That was about 4,5 billion. It was the first thing we did last year. The Constitution and the debt-backed fund. The majority of this fund was about 6.600 million.

We also loaned Outstanding's bank to repay at $3.80 million. The rest is ours. Some inflows of the operating balance. This is a part of approximate cash. That part of the receivables is about two billion more than last year. That's the main reason.

The first part of this section is the conditions for this part of our customers to receive payments. The number of days is increased. This is the number of customers here. In fact, we have some pressure on some of the clients. This is the result of an increase in the balance of our receivables.

This time is mainly the part of the customer in the south. That is only the point of view of our strategy. Basically because these customers are really big customers. Then there is not much risk that this account is bad, and then there is not much of the risk that this account is bad.

Or the process of negotiating to seek more orders. This is probably a situation. In addition, because the turnover increase in the first quarter of this year in the Nantou plant is relatively obvious.

That's why it's relative. The balance of revenue accounts has also increased. That's a more obvious drop in current liabilities here. That's just what we mentioned in Q3 last year.

So there is basically no bank borrowing outstanding at the moment. That's the part of the current table. This is probably what we've just been told about. Cash. Some major changes to the same period last year. That's the non-current assets sold in Q1 this year.

That's what we just mentioned last year in Q4. There's a benefit to collecting in the factory area on the land. It's up to this year. It's received most of the time in the first quarter. The remaining balance is about 10 million yuan. It's also recovered in the second quarter.

This is an overview of the current situation. That's part of the financial ratio. The current debt ratio is about 22%. That's just mentioning that we already have convertible debt in the present.

So we now have a relatively lower amount of external debt. That's because the convertible debt basically hasn't been converted. That's why it's also here. If there's a possibility of further conversion in the future, this amount will be lower in theory.

That is, the weekly days of receivables. Our first quarter is about 94 days. It is actually a slow increase compared to the past. That's just what I mentioned here.

So the current billing period is about 90 100, so this part is. The pressure on the client side is relatively high. We just talk from our point of view. We also get more from the customer.

That's the indicator of profitability. That is. EPS was relatively high in the same period last year, but if we exclude it, it's our income tax.

Should be at 1.82. So. Q1 said in the last three years. This year's Q1 is a better operating condition. But the difference. That portion of the revenue.

This is the car, the part of the display, the last few years have been down, but.

The speed is not, so it's probably, the train.

That's it, that's it, that's it.

This is the part of the product analysis, that is, the light green part is the part of the safety belt, that is, it is the part of our current turnover is the highest part of the product category, in the car here, the main probability of production is in the mainland, and Poland, relatively small, Poland about 200 million years, then the other part is in the mainland. The first quarter is a slight decline compared to the last year, but the magnitude is not large, basically it is a normal fluctuation, not a special abnormal situation. The blue part is the part of the airbag, which is basically in the first quarter of the production, there is a large increase in demand in the customer's demand in the first quarter, so in the first quarter is the increase in the safety belt is the size of the size of the safety belt is still larger than the last one, so we are still a lot of the next year, this is the next year, this is the next year, this is a more than the same thing is the next time, this is the same thing is the next time, this is the same thing is the next time, this is the next time, this is the same thing is the next time, this is the next time, this is the next time, this is a more is a more than the next time, this is a more is a more than the same thing is a little, this is a more than the same thing is a more than the same thing is a more than the same thing is a little, this is the same thing is the same thing is a little thing is the same thing is a more than the same thing is a little thing is a little thing is a little thing, this is a little, this is a more than a more than a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a lot, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is the next time, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is the next time, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little, this is a little,

This is about the part of the car, which shows that we just said that the decline in the previous few years is more obvious, is that it is still a loss after 20 years of production, last year it seems like a loss about 30 million, the main one in our scale comparison is not enough, then it seems that there will be no obvious downward sales in this 7.8 billion year, so it is likely that this is about a turnover of about 7800 million years, so of course, it is mainly that our main show here in Taiwan is a trading department, and there are factories here in Germany there also a trading department, so that the two areas are still operating, that is that is, that is also continue to do some of these two new customers and new business development, so about to show that it is relatively stable in the last few years. This is why we want to make more orders in Europe, so the new order is basically a local demand on this side of Europe, and we want to pull this scale to a relatively economical level as soon as possible. This is a brief explanation of our future, then we will give you a question, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

The Chief Financial Officer Hello, I am looking at you on the official website to see that you have one of the products to do is this emergency seat belt, is likely to predict the collision it will tighten, then I would ask because it may be said in the fire pill, but as far as I know, not all such kind of seat belt is used with fire pill, then ask what is the difference between them, this is the first question, then the second question is, if I don't have one answer you.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the verbatim text of the user and organize it into paragraph verbatim text. First, I want to read the original content of the user carefully to ensure that I understand the sentence corresponding to each timestamp. The user emphasizes that nothing can be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be arranged strictly in the original order.

First of all, I will check each timestamp and the corresponding sentence to make sure that there are no omissions or duplicates. For example, the user-provided verbatim has multiple timestamps, such as [1049. 00-1050. 00], followed by [1050. 00-1051. 00], and so on. I need to sort these in chronological order and combine the sentences in the same paragraph into consecutive paragraphs. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or conversational rotation in order to make reasonable segmentation.

In addition, the user mentions to keep everything, including duplicate or redundant parts. For example, in timestamps [1486 00-1487. 00] and [1487. 00-1488. 00], the phrase "United States" is repeated twice and must be retained. Similarly, sentences in timestamps [1497. 00-1501. 00] and [1501-1504. 00] also need to be fully retained even if they may be incomplete or need to be supplemented later.

At the same time, make sure that no personal explanation or modification is added, and that it is completely organized according to the user's requirements. </think>

The part that we do with the seatbelt is the pipe inside the prefabricated seatbelt. The pipe that we do with the seatbelt is actually the pipe that needs to be ignited, just that we do not do with the gun. We are simply the pipe that makes the metal. That is done by the customer in filling the gunbelt and the whole set of this prefabricated seatbelt. So the seatbelt part is actually just the part that we don't do with the gunbelt. But because I have my own car, sometimes it tightens the seatbelt when the car may stop when the red light is closer to the motorcycle.

But because it may be repeated several times, many may not be the act of firecracker. You should say that it is electronic, is more new is the electronic detection of its active. Then, the main purpose is to depreciate this is the accident that is going to explode in this safe airfield. That is because it is not the case of the safety belt in the past is a physical way to tighten, so it actually has a space to say that you will be tightened a little bit before you start. So there will be a lot of accidents is the safety airbag, it is a very hard to restart it in an instant. But because the safety belt is too slow, so the head hit will cause some serious damage.

So the pre shrinkable seat belt is actually a signal to the seat belt at the same time as the airbag is in motion, so it will be tightened in the first moment. It is usually with us after opening some warning to tighten the lower one. So there will be two stages of the car? The pre shrinkable seat belt will also explode when you open the airbag, which is one-time.

The second problem is because we are doing some steering parts, and there is this part of the safety belt airbag section to ask if there is an EV bill now? Then there is the EV station, if there is a receipt, the station company's revenue is likely to be such a percent? We turned to the EPS part, we actually did it for years, then there is still a little more, there is no obvious increase, but also the opposite. We are in the electric car, to tell you is the electric car or the part of the electric car?

The parts we make are not limited to electric vehicles or simply based on different platforms. But the specific ones are for electric vehicles or this general fuel vehicle we don't have complete control because we are the parts. The customer will make it into a module and then go to the factory. Many of these parts are common platforms, so we don't have complete control of what it is like to say.

That said, we don't have a lot to say that if we go to an electric vehicle, we're going to have a lot to do, but we don't have a lot to do. Thank you, Chief Financial Officer, I want to ask you, because it looks like the revenue in the United States and Europe could be up to 60% of the revenue. That's the question is whether it's either in Europe or in Europe, or in Europe.

That's why the US dollar is mainly focused on the US dollar. So to speak about the fluctuations of the US dollar itself, do not talk about the parts of the US dollar, then we are here with the customer for more important products, assuming that it is not the products of the yuan, we have to sign this exchange rate adjustment price formula. However, the main reason for this formula is that the currency of the yuan and the euro is our main raw material of the purchase currency, and that the US dollar is the price of the customer's currency.

But another problem is that the appreciation of the dollar, which I think is not a more difficult part of it, that is, because the dollar appreciation is more like the appreciation of the dollar, not a common link with all other currencies, that is, the situation of the dollar itself. If this part is already under a situation, but for the U.S. dollar group, there will be a relatively high proportion of the dollar's cost invested, in fact, in the South China market, this part will be affected by a certain extent.

Or do we say that we are mainly uh, compared to OE way to ship? Or what? The one we now belong to is probably T2, because we are sure that these things are OE, this is all safety parts, so it must be OE things. We count T2, we deliver to T1, T1 it is a lot of T2 suppliers like us, assembled a bunch of parts, then handed to the factory.

The U.S. is about half. The U.S. is about half. U.S. is basically the euro. That's mainly because we're in the airbag right now, and it costs you the most.

This is the essence of the material, the pipe, then the pipe, the airbag, it may account for nearly six percent. This part of the pipe is imported from Europe.

The cost of the associated plant that happened in Taiwan, and then the costs of the personnel, those are the dollars, so there will be some influence here, so when it comes to the purchase, when it is.

It should be, but it shouldn't be too big. I'm going to say this. Well, we don't have to go to the store to calculate it, because this change is quick. That's basic. Basically, uh, we don't have that kind of data.

He is not only the one who is the recipient of the gift, but also the one who is the recipient of the gift, the one who is the recipient of the gift, the one who is the recipient of the gift, the one who is the recipient of the gift, the one who is the recipient of the gift, the one who is the recipient of the gift, and the one who is the recipient of the gift.

"This is the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, the month of Ramadan, and the month of Ramadan.

And this is what he is about to do. All he has to do is be safe. And we are all things created in the earth. That is to say, we want to get more orders here in Europe. So we want to deliver that. That is to be sure.

Our customers need more or less of us. Or he wants someone else to give it to me. So I don't think that's who I'm talking about. That's what we're trying to do with our customers. That's why we're trying to get more orders. That's why they want to get cheaper.

Or the quality is better. Or a good speaker engineer. So it is probably such a communication. It's about 5 million euros a year. So it's all right.

Sorry about three hundred million. We have three. So about three total about 115. 15 16. If you are full.

That's just because it's slowly increasing. We're only certain that the first one is. It's going to start shipping in August this year. The second one should be next year. But it's the progress of the client. Because we're adding these lines now.

For customers in the European market, we are actually two cents. So it is also according to the needs of customers here. And he is a whole change with one cent. We can be more sure of the number and schedule of that later. But at least the first one looks. It should start mass production this August.

If this is the case, it's only a few thousand words, I think it's not enough, but it should be.

"We have a lot to say about it," he said, "and we have a lot to say about it, and we have a lot to say about it, and we have a lot to say about it, and we have a lot to say about it.

That average inflation in the middle of each year is basically the same. And the increase in cost is in two numbers. So that's what we're going to do. Including these products are actually what we get when we get the amount. In fact, the customer also wants us a little bit.

Or, if we do not have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so, and if we do not have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so, and if we have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so; and if we have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so; and if we have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so; and if we have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so, and if we have the right to do so, then we have the right to do so.

So the new line added to this line. It's hard to say how much the loss will be, because the variable has always been, and there are different variables that affect it. But basically I think its direction should be full of certainty.

That said, we have an increase in the loss is going down. That in a factory, the amount of 200 million dollars is really too small. Like our Nantou plant may now have 17.8 billion. The mainland also has more than 200 billion dollars. It is a relatively reasonable size. It contains a lot of this.

"This is the word of the Lord, saying, 'This is the way; walk in it, and do not walk in it; for nothing is hidden from you, but it is hidden from you.'

Just because the three full-time points may also be in the second half of next year or next year. The conditions may be different at that time. So the part we didn't go to is to calculate the possible conditions very finely. But that's what we're going to do now. We'll do some calculations and observations. It's at least foreseeable.

There may be a possibility of a situation. This part of us does not have to say that it is very detailed to calculate, that is, we are more determined with the time, because we are closer to the time, like the first case, we will have a more clear amount of this amount with the data.

That's another part of the cost. Although we've done this in mainland China, it's based on the experience of the first product we've had before. The difference between mainland China and Poland's cost is really big. The second product is now added.

But its cost is also really going to go through the mass production. We will compare it to determine how it is likely to fall in a level. Ask each other about one of the products. You may see a sort of perspective, and a sort of perspective.

Your order is. For example, because you see it. The proportion of each product. For example, Airbag is DG 39. Then CBL is 52%.

I'd like to ask the Chief Financial Officer. That's different for each product. That's to see this year's product different. It has an outlook sorting. Basically, it's pretty much the EPS part.

EPS is pretty obvious. Because we don't have any new orders and customers. So EPS is pretty much the same as a few years ago. It's not even a growing one, but it's probably there. The seat belt and airbags are actually slightly increased.

This is the first time in a long time, especially in the first season, the airbag of the Nantong factory is only obvious. There is also a slight difference in the back. The part of the seat belt is just mentioned.

Just like Poland. That's the part of the seat belt. So basically the seat belt and airbag are just like us. The overall condition of the group is almost the same.

This is a small continuous growth, so the EPS should be relatively sharp. Know thank you. Do you think this EPS will not grow much? Because it is a relatively large pick-up, you think it will not grow much? Because it is a relatively large pick-up, you think it will not grow much?

We also have some changes in the situation of our customers' pulls, because the majority of this is consignment, just in the first quarter when the customers have a relatively large pick-up, which I think will not be so high, should be a growth situation, but should not be so high a percentage. Because we actually have this increase in airbag, in fact, mainly in the mainland, our airbags are the largest or the United States, but in the mainland, in fact, it has increased in recent years, is the supply here in Taiwan.

Do you not think that they will do all that We have commanded them, and that they will do all that We have commanded them to do, and that they will do all that We have commanded them to do, and that they will do all that We have commanded them to do?

What do you think they do? Well, it should be said that our three big customers, the three customers, basically more than 90% of the market, then the three customers will do it, so the three will not conflict. In fact, it is white, white their needs are talking about, and then they will talk about it. Just say that our own production, the airbag is mainly in Taiwan, and then the belt is in China and Poland.

This is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business. It is the most important part of our business.

It is enough, very very very very, so in general, part of the time out of control, we can very much look forward to, 17 12 seconds, it is probably jun garments, afraid of parking enanta, CCP anything, today's strong, almost, all, there is no such a thing, the refuge may be a little lower, Taiwan Maori slightly lower, may be 20 out, then the safety belt in the mainland is relatively high, because Poland is relatively low, the mainland should be 27 28, right, so the whole average is about 25, the difference is not too big, probably the safety belt is a little higher. I don't know that the investment advanced, but there are some other things I want to know?

I don't think so much. Just as we talked about the construction of the plant, about 34,000, that's why we rent. That's what makes us a legally compliant environment, and that's what we use. Then, the equipment part hasn't taken into account yet. Next, I want to say a little bit.

This should be a very difficult task. Should it be hard? In the past, we had few goals that were unlikely to be achieved. Except for the kind of situation like the epidemic recovery, otherwise, in our normal development, there is an increase in one, then slowly climb. So, it is difficult to be a relatively large scale.

It seems like it was a very short first quarter, because the time was short, so I just pulled it up a bit. So I think the scale of the later will also decrease. Overall, I think it should be something similar to the past. It is a magnitude of that number.

In addition, we also need to note a little bit. The appreciation of the dollar will also have some effect. The more direct impact is that, for example, the revenue from China or Europe, there is less revenue from the transfer of money back to the dollar. If it is calculated in the dollar, it is also less. So I think it may be a small scale.

Finally, thank you for your participation today. If you have any further questions, we would like to share this session with you. Thank you.
