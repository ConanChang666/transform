We welcome you to participate in the S.P.S. Plastics Industry Co., Ltd. corporate briefing session. First of all, we would like to introduce you to the management team that represents today. Welcome to Chairman Liu Zuying. President Liu Yaxin. Hello everyone.

Eric. Thank you. Tiffany is happy. Share the company's results and future prospects with you. We'll leave the time to the company today.

Thank you. It's nice to see you all at today's presentation on the future of plastic. Today's stock is not very good. It's broken down by 22. But today we really talked about some of the positive things we're going to say. I hope you find some good ones.

Look at this. Do not say anything before you start. Report it. This statement may be some data or something. Our company is not responsible for updating.

That may be a simple read for you. That goes into today's focus. There will be a few donations in GPG for an hour. A 10-minute report. A 10-minute QA section. He will discuss these donations with you.

At the beginning of the day. I still want a lot of new friends who may not understand a business model of our own making. But basically our company is. It may feel like it's just a precision machining. But you see the application behind it and some of our future prospects.

We can see the current overall scale. The current share capital is about 10.97 billion. By the end of last year, our headquarter is about the west of Taipei. But it is important that we have three factories in Taiwan.

There is also Wu Xi. That is the part of Suzhou and Xi'an. That is Thailand. When the president will make an update with you. The future of Thailand is one of our very important growth. Part of it is now in a relatively unstable political situation in Thailand.

It will be a production base for our important strategy. Our company is mainly focused on a focus. Basically, it is not just design and research. In the Foaming section, there are special parts of Foaming. For example, cutting.

Then, the forming cast. The diving and stacking part. This is our company.

This is all about precision machinery and technology. Very mature technology to do so. The later part I will introduce in detail with you. Overall, we are one of our factories. One is currently in operation.

The leftmost is our future in Thailand. It will start at the end of the year and the beginning of next year.

I think you'll see our fourth quarter data. It may seem less than expected. But I'm here to tell you something. Our fourth quarter revenue is probably 11.9 billion.

However, the gross profit of the business is about 2.45 billion. You can look at the QoQ part. The topline part is about 7% of the decline.

The Maori portion is about 14 percent of the decline. I think the average person sees that day. The price-to-price reaction is also very intense. I would like to tell you that the update part is. In fact, our gross profit margin. The change compared to the third quarter.

In fact, the difference is big. It is mainly due to accountants. At ride off we are. Last year was because we wanted. Accounting with our subsidiaries. The principle achievement is relative.

So ride off a lot. That is, some obsolete inventory. Over this inventory is the number of years. If more than one year to two years. In order to ourselves. Direct sales group is more strict accounting standards.

That's different. So the main part of the other accounting achievement. So we beat our gross profit margin relatively. But basically our product pricing. With cost to good selling is remain stable. So the actual gross profit margin is relatively stable.

It is only because the courier has put out outdated inventions. We put it on cost to good sold. So it has a relative impact on our actual.

It is possible to see that this is the reason why we are here. The return water is about two thousand and two million parts. It is mainly in the same way.

As you can see, mainly the part that we ended up in business. This is also our president and our accountant. Relatively old accounting principal. So there are close to 95 million ride off. So actually is the number of our operations.

In fact, it is different from the third quarter. If you can add it back, the fourth quarter is a big difference from the third quarter. So the high-speed part is actually here. That's not recurring. That's effective rate tax rate.

It's basically the same as the third quarter. So you can see what we said last year in the fourth quarter. That's probably a negative $400 million for the tribal market first. But the part of the operating label doesn't really have any effect.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim and convert it into paragraph-provided verbatim. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed into any sentence, so the integrity and order of the original word must be maintained.

First of all, I will check the script snippet provided to see if there is a timestamp or other markup that needs to be processed. In the example given by the user, each sentence has a timestamp, such as [409. 88-411. 88], which needs to be retained during the conversion, but may not be displayed in the final paragraph. However, the user does not explicitly specify whether a timestamp is retained, so further confirmation may be required. However, according to the example provided by the user, timestamps are retained, so I will process the timestamps according to the example. Next, I need to rearrange the phrases that are separated by sentences into paragraphs. The key is to identify which sentences belong to the same paragraph.

For example, when a speaker begins to discuss a new topic, it may be necessary to start a new paragraph. At the same time, be aware of the connection between sentences, such as "that", "so", "but", etc. These may indicate the beginning or end of a paragraph. During the process, I will check it out on a regular basis to make sure that there are no missing sentences. For example, in a user-provided transcription, some sentences may fall into the same paragraph, such as a discussion about the aerospace section, or parts of a car application.

For example, if the speaker is introducing the slide content, it may be necessary to combine the relevant sentences into the same paragraph. During the process, also pay attention to the consistency of the sentence to ensure the transition between paragraphs is natural. For example, when the speaker transitions from one topic to another, it may be necessary to insert an empty line or segmentation character to distinguish between different paragraphs.

At the same time, confirm that the format of the timestamp is correct, paragraph divisions are reasonable, in line with the requirements of the user. Now, I will follow the steps above to process the transcription provided by the user, to ensure that each sentence is correctly classified into the corresponding paragraph, while maintaining the integrity and order of the original. </think> The following is a paragraph type transcription (totally retain all the original sentences, undeleted or rewritten): [409. 88-411. 88] Relatively, it is a very solid part. [411. 88-413. 88] It can be seen. [413. 88-414. 88] Another last slide.

[414. 88-415. 88] Let's take a look. [415. 88-418. 88] Here is a change in some values. [418. 88-420. 88] You can take a look at the factory area of Taiwan. [420. 88-421. 88] The revenue portion. [421. 88-423. 88] It slowly tumbles down. [423.8-424. 88] The mainland factory.

[424. 88-427. 88] Relatively speaking, you can look at it deliberately. [427. 88-428. 88] looks like a stable inside. [428. 88-429. 88] exactly where the gap is. [429. 88-431. 88] This is one of the major changes we made last year. [431. 88-433. 88] This is probably part of spacecraft. [433. 88-435. 88] See our 2024 section.

[435. 88-437. 88] Aerospace has reached a 440 billion litre. [437. 88-440. 88] Aerospace is in this wave of trade war. [440. 88-442. 88] Products are relative. [442. 88-444. 88] There is no trade sanction. [444. 88-445. 88] Everyone knows that space is a long-term certification. [445. 88-447. 88]

[447. 88-450. 88] Then the material is part of the guest assigned. [450. 88-452. 88] So it will not be affected by these. [452. 88-456. 88] A part of the tax impact of trade. [456. 88-457. 88] Here for us. [457. 88-459. 88] It is actually a plus part. [459. 88-461. 88] The other part is at

[461. 88-463. 88] Parts of automotive applications. [463. 88-464. 88] Relatively speaking, [464. 88-465. 88] We are all part of the continent. [465. 88-467. 88] Parts of the continent are relative. [467. 88-468. 88] I think this year.

[471. 88-472. 88] So. [472. 88-474. 88] I see our trade market in China. [474. 88-475. 88] I think there may be no optimism. [475. 88-476. 88] I look forward to the next. [476. 88-478. 88] I give my time to the President of Yellow. [481. 88-482. 88] Thank you all.

[482. 88-484. 88] This afternoon. [484. 88-486. 88] It's usually easy to break. [486. 88-490. 88] But today I ask a very basic question. [490. 88-495. 88] How many companies are currently listed on Taiwan's stock exchange or the top company. [495. 88-499. 88] How many companies are actually being marketed in Taiwan. [499. 88-499. 88]

[500. 88-501. 88] is different from the others. [501. 88-501. 88] The biggest difference between other companies that have not been marketed is where. [505. 88-501. 88] It may be in the short term. [508. 88-513. 88] Some people have been focusing on one of his EPSs. [513. 88-514. 88] How could it be bigger. [514. 88]

[516. 88-518. 88] It is not possible. [518. 88-520. 88] I often talk about a big tree. [520. 88-522. 88] There is a big tree in the world. [522.1 88-524. 88] It can be developed in 4G. [524. 88-526. 88] You may have opened a beautiful store in a certain season. [526. 88-527. 88] You have found a lot of fruit.

[527. 88-529. 88] But the end of that 3G. [529. 88-530. 88] relative. [530. 88-533. 88] relative. [533. 88-536. 88] relative. [536. 88-538. 88] relative. [538. 88-540. 88] relative. [530. 88] relative.

[540. 88-542. 88] I'll tell you more. [542. 88-543. 88] Today. [543. 88-545. 88] If you've seen this YouTube recently, there are two important news. [545. 88-547. 88] An important news is [547. 88-548. 88] This so-called screw industry in Tainan.

[550. 88-553. 88] Speaking of COVID. [553. 88-554. 88] Looking to negotiate. [554. 88-556. 88] Creating a great output value. [556. 88-558. 88] Even larger than Tainan's semiconductors. [558. 88-560. 88] In addition, Tainan Engineering Department. [560. 88-562. 88] Also speaking of Tainan's machine tools.

[562. 88-565. 88] But the two are now turned into fruit. [565. 88-567. 88] The difference is where I am. [567. 88-569. 88] I'm going to go back to something. [569. 88-570. 88] The enterprise is going to be listed today. [570. 88-574. 88] It is necessary to keep thinking about continuing to grow. [574. 88-576. 88] The plastic is compared with the peers.

[576. 88-577. 88] We had a full night. [577. 88-579. 88] We had a good comparison with the Department of Sociology. [579. 88-581. 88] It was 13 years late compared with the down. [581. 88-583. 88] The forest with them was 23 years late. [583. 88-584. 88] It was not necessary to talk more. [584. 88-586. 88] But the focus was on that.

[586. 88-589. 88] Some of their predecessors are good. [589. 88-590. 88] Their salary is also a lot. [590. 88-591. 88] is also on the market. [591. 88-592. 88] However, the difference between them is getting smaller and smaller. [592. 88-595. 88]

[596. 88-599. 88] We may not be good enough for this EPS. [601. 88-602. 88] We may not be good enough for our gross profit. [602. 88-604. 88] But the focus of the lack is on where. [604. 88-607. 88] The actual plastic will continue to grow. [607. 88-610. 88] The plastic will continue to build talent.

[610. 88-613. 88] Plastic is continuing to build this team. [613. 88-614. 88] This is a different place for us. [614. 88-616. 88] So I took this opportunity to share it with you. [616. 88-617. 88] Several concepts. [617. 88-618. 88] First. [618. 88-618. 88] Today we are talking about the industry.

[619. 88-623. 88] includes the automotive industry, including industrial products. [623. 88-625. 88] includes aerospace. [625. 88-627. 88] Speaks of the automotive industry. [627. 88-629. 88] Speaks of the automotive industry. [629. 88-631. 88] I believe we all see it. [631. 88-633. 88] May become a sink.

[633. 88-634. 88] But. [634. 88-637. 88] Just read a picture above. [637. 88-639. 88] Taiwan and mainland China. [639. 88-642. 88] There is also this part of the reinvestment. [642. 88-643. 88] We make a big difference. [643. 88-647. 88] The parts of the automotive industry have reached 50%.

[647. 88-648. 88] Where is it? [648. 88-650. 88] Taiwan. [650. 88-651. 88] In fact, it is the same as Taiwan's middle class. [651. 88-653. 88]

[656. 88-659. 88] At that time, it was the production of automotive safety parts. [659. 88-662. 88] But if I am still missing the packagers today. [662. 88-663. 88] I have been hanging for a long time. [663. 88-665. 88] So I am going to talk further today. [665. 88-667. 88] Take a look at industrial products. [667. 88-669. 88] Industrial products are diversified.

[669. 88-671. 88] We talked about it before. [671. 88-672. 88] We rely on the automotive industry. [674. 88-676. 88] Later on. [676. 88-678. 88] Especially in COVID. [678. 88-680. 88] We are more significant.

[680. 88-681. 88] Everyone has a dream. [681. 88-682.1. 88] When we arrived at the laboratory. [682. 88-685. 88] When COVID was on the bike, there was a bonus. [685. 88-687. 88] When that time hit red. [687. 88-690. 88] In 2022, our revenue reached 4.9 billion. [690. 88-693. 88] It did not come from.

[693. 88-694. 88] came out. [694. 88-697. 88] But a lot of work was done on the bicycle. [697. 88-699. 88] We did a lot in the rod file. [699. 88-703. 88] Our industrial products are embodied in the diversified development. [703. 88-705. 88] We are in the industrial products. [705. 88-706. 88] We are in the petrochemical industry.

[706. 88-708. 88] In this regard in semiconductors. [708. 88-711. 88] includes high-end bicycles in this regard. [711. 88-711. 88] The words of the high-end bicycles. [711. 88-715. 88] The chairman of the huge this year is still speaking. [715.

Below is a re-arranged paragraph-by-text transcript: [807. 88-811. 88] 10% of the cost spread conversion is impossible. [811. 88-812. 88] So this is the time to talk about it. [812. 88-814. 88] Why is it actually seen? [814. 88-816. 88] Important point is this industry. [816. 88-819. 88] Today, from upstream to downstream.

[819. 88-821. 88] We all see it transparently. [821. 88-824. 88] We all know the future development of the industry. [824. 88-827. 88] We all see the industry today. [827. 88-829. 88] In this regard, [829. 88-833. 88] We can't really think about it at a cost. [833. 88-835. 88] So today he considers it.

[835. 88-837. 88] Today there are too many factories in machinery processing. [837. 88-839. 88] There are a lot of factories in Taiwan. [839. 88-841. 88] A lot of factories. [841. 88-843.8. 88] But the point is that [843. 88-845. 88] There is no factory with aerospace certification. [845. 88-846. 88] There is a car certification.

[846. 88-848. 88] There are industrial product certifications. [848. 88-851. 88] There are no international certifications. [851. 88-853. 88] There are not many. [853. 88-855. 88] Why these things are so important. [855. 88-855. 88] But it is true. [855. 88-855. 88] Because you have to pass through this layer of filtering.

[859. 88-860. 88] The layers of the test. [860. 88-862. 88] You are alive. [862. 88-86. 88] You represent quality. [86. 88-867. 88] It is not the boss who speaks with his mouth. [867. 88-870. 88] It is the daily work of quality. [870. 88-872. 88] So it is the reason why you are here.

[872. 88-874. 88] In the past two years, we have all been talking about this. [874. 88-876. 88] We have no intention of informing you. [876. 88-878. 88] But come from the logical side. [878. 88-880. 88] You are the guest you will choose. [880. 88-882. 88] You are the guest you will choose. [882. 88-884. 88] I will tell you who you will choose. [882. 88-884. 88]

[888. 88-885. 88] That's the opposite. [888. 88-886. 88] In the automotive industry. [888. 88-888. 88] We made a car safety charger early. [888. 88-891. 88] We made a part of the car safety. [891. 88-894. 88] At the same time, we were from abroad alone. [894. 88-897. 88] After Taiwan, we moved to mainland China.

[897. 88-898. 88] In 2008. [898. 88-900. 88] We moved to the limit. [900. 88-904. 88] Because we felt that the risk of a single industry was too high. [904. 88-906. 88] Despite the car safety skills. [906. 88-909. 88] We have some so-called bodyguards. [909. 88-909. 88] This three-tier three-tier box.

[912. 88-914. 88] Because we were different from ordinary products at that time. [914. 88-919. 88] We worked with China Steel to develop a clean steel. [919. 88-920. 88] So far. [920. 88-923. 88] This clean steel is still the same material. [923. 88-924. 88] This is also the reason why. [924. 88-826. 88] We can be on the market.

[926. 88-29. 88] Can withstand a lot of competitors. [929. 88-933. 88] But today's car safety skills speak. [933. 88-935. 88] It is also required to survive. [935. 88-936. 88] So it also made a lot of changes. [936. 88-938. 88] That's why we invested in stamping in 2021.

[942. 88-944. 88] Because we see this thing. [944. 88-946. 88] It changes in the market trend. [946. 88-947. 88] Relatively speaking. [947. 88-949. 88] We were in 2008. [949. 88-952. 88] It was strange in mainland China. [952. 88-956. 88] We built a new team.

[956. 88-958. 88] Specializing in a group of people pulled out. [958. 88-960. 88] Completely cut with daily work. [960. 88-962. 88] Build a new team. [962. 88-966. 88] This new team is focused on the development of the automotive industry. [966. 88-968. 88] So this is a big development. [968. 88-970. 88] Beginning in 2012.

[970. 88-973. 88] A whole lot of cars from abroad have moved to mainland China. [973. 88-975. 88] is called automation of things. [975. 88-977. 88] is also localized. [977. 88-980. 88] is added to the time of COVID. [980. 88-983. 88] refers to mainland China in 2021. [983. 88-985. 88] converts from oil to electricity.

[995. 88-997. 88] The spring after the rain. [987. 88-989. 88] Actually, it is different from the general company. [989. 88-992.1 88] We use a lot of localization. [992. 88-994.1 88] It is also because of localization. [994. 88-996. 88] It is impossible to imagine. [996. 88-998. 88]

[998. 88-1002. 88] This year's latest situation is about 32 million vehicles. [1003. 88-1006. 88] of which is 7.5 million exports. [1006. 88-1008. 88] 25 million domestic sales. [1008. 88-1010. 88] 25 million domestic sales. [1010. 88-1012. 88] BYAD has a large atmosphere. [1012. 88-1015. 88] There are many manufacturers.

[1015. 88-1017. 88] In fact, there are nearly 100 people in mainland China right now. [1017. 88-1019. 88] Do electric vehicles. [1019. 88-1021. 88] But soon will be eliminated. [1021. 88-1022. 88] But the truth is, [1022. 88-1024. 88] If there is no local resource, [1024. 88] There is no local commitment. [1024. 88-1026. 88]

[1026. 88-1027. 88] We will definitely hang it. [1027. 88-1029. 88] But today we will talk. [1029. 88-1030. 88] is in this series of things. [1030. 88-1031. 88] You can see. [1031. 88-1033. 88] We are one of them. [1033. 88] We are separated.

[1034. 88-1035. 88] When we are separated. [1035. 88-1037. 88] What we are doing. [1037. 88-1038. 88] What we are doing. [1038. 88-1041. 88] You can also come to the drawing to see me. [1041. 88-1042. 88] Good back. [1042. 88-1044. 88] I won't hesitate to talk to you again.

[1044. 88-1046. 88] So let's talk about it now. [1046. 88-1047. 88] My colleagues told me there was nothing on the chassis of the car. [1047. 88-1051. 88] You probably heard me say this for the first time. [1053. 88-1055. 88] Very rarely heard the industry say this. [1055. 88] If Compass introduced it.

[1057. 88-1059. 88] There are a lot of things on the chassis. [1059. 88-1060. 88] Sorry. [1060. 88-1061. 88] Today in an electric vehicle. [1061. 88-1063. 88] There is a growing trend. [1063. 88] There is nothing on the chassis. [1066. 88-1067. 88] Only under the chassis.

[1067. 88-1070. 88] Together with the Chinese mainland. [1070. 88-1072. 88] Everyone is competing. [1072. 88-1074. 88] Today the financial mainland. [1074. 88-1078. 88] The automobile in the atmosphere of the mainland. [1078. 88-1081. 88] The electric vehicle may be related to the industry. [1081. 88-1083. 88] A traditional oil and electricity.

[1083. 88-1085. 88] Possible atmosphere. [1085. 88-1088. 88] Electric vehicles may have an atmosphere of up to 50 units. [1088. 88-1091. 88] And it continues to increase. [1091. 88-1092. 88] So electric vehicles. [1092. 88-1094. 88] Such atmosphere. [1094. 88] It is possible.

[1095. 88-1097. 88] Because everyone is at the price ratio. [1097. 88-1099. 88] But at the same time the ratio function. [1099. 88-1102. 88] Some functions in the high-end industry. [1102. 88-1104. 88] Slowly moved to electric vehicles. [1104. 88-1106. 88] Even on the chassis. [1106. 88-1107. 88] This is where we are.

[1107. 88-1109. 88] Why can I say that. [1109. 88-1110. 88] This is Shishuo and the general company. [1110. 88-1111. 88] The same place. [1111. 88-1113. 88] Shishuo is on engineering. [1113. 88-1115. 88] We have a so-called engine here. [1115. 88-1117. 88] The engine is called a car.

[1117. 88-1118. 88] is called aerospace. [1118. 88-1120. 88] Aerospace is also a good history. [1120. 88-1121. 88] Today 2020. [1121. 88-1122. 88] Today, [1122. 88-1124. 88] Aerospace is known for its high thresholds. [1124. 88-1126. 88] But we all know that.

[1126. 88-1128. 88] There is a lot of money burning. [1128. 88-1131. 88] You have to find one from the beginning to the end. [1131. 88-1133. 88] All-round supply chain. [1133. 88-1135. 88] It is impossible. [1135. 88-1138. 88] Now everyone comes after 2020. [1138. 88-1140. 88] When the epidemic is over.

[1140. 88-1142. 88] Everyone heard about the global supply chain. [1142. 88-1144. 88] Bened and dispersed. [1144. 88-1146. 88] So many customers care about what. [1146. 88-1149. 88] We found a full service. [1149. 88-1150. 88] That's why. [1151. 88-1153. 88] In 2021, Shishuo was in 2020.

[1153. 88-1155. 88] Dare to invest in the world. [1155. 88-1157. 88] Next, I will share with you the further report. [1157. 88-1159. 88] This restaurant. [1159. 88-1161. 88] I will return. [1161. 88-1164. 88] We are talking about two important points. [1164. 88-1166. 88]

[1166. 88-1167. 88] Of course, plus the preceding thing. [1167. 88-1169. 88] We three components. [1169. 88-1171. 88] Two important points of view. [1171. 88-1173. 88] The first component is a car. [1173. 88-1175. 88] Oil and electricity. [1175. 88-1176. 88] The whole mixed thing.

[1176. 88-1178. 88] Second is industrial products. [1178. 88-1178. 88] Diverse. [1179. 88-1181. 88] Diverse includes automobiles. [1181. 88-1183. 88] Includes industrial servers. [1183. 88-1184. 88] AI servers. [1184. 88-1188. 88] includes what is called a robot in the future.

[1188. 88-1189. 88] These things. [1189. 88-1192. 88] There are also petrochemical crawlers that work together. [1192. 88-1195. 88] Including spacecraft. [1195. 88-1197. 88] Because of these three pieces.

In addition, we have two strategies: the first localization, the deep localization, and the continued strengthening of the economies of scale. We are pragmatic in the stone sculpture, and to talk about how the mainland was demolished and brought back to life. When you demolished, you have no way of accumulating your economic scale effect from the start. The second we talk about international expansion, international expansion, so Thailand factory is also one of the international expansion.

So when I talk about the importance of stone plastic, we clearly define it to do what we do, why we do what we do, why we do what we don't do. General companies don't know, anyway today there is a business will do well, rarely talk about the culture of the enterprise, rarely talk about the purpose of the enterprise, rarely talk about the purpose of the enterprise. When the enterprise does a lot of time to go away, we rarely talk about the purpose of the enterprise's mission, a few aspects of the operation.

What is the strategy of a company? What is the most important thing for an organization? Why is it so important? Because to talk about the company is now hit people, hit people, how do you put a group of people together, people go in one direction, not just me and I, each of them wonder. If you can look at Google can see, although it is very good, but your internal management really has a lot of problems. So let's talk about how to get everyone from different backgrounds, how to find the people from different backgrounds to find a common relationship, we talk about the position of empathy.

We have been talking about the ability to build a one-stop service in a diversified niche market, and I use bamboo to say that I want to become the most talented old, the most professional, to help our old to make money, that is, we make money for our customers. In contrast, I can not become a well-known in this industry, a company with the words T, we can not become like this, this is what we have always insisted on doing. Third, the organization we will never rely on one person, nor will it be said that we are the same people to talk with different customers, that is impossible.

At the same time, we talk about talent, let people feel that there is a chance to shine on this platform, let people take to the following team to continue to do big, this is a different place. So the speed is very important to talk about this different place, what are we talking about? In the niche market how to do a professional positioning, how to build word of mouth effect.

When we talk about Dell working with a computer, what do we do with it? Working with Apple, he's next to Apple to this office, what do you want me to give you. When you feed the guests, the channel depends on you, this is your dish, this is the same concept. So we talk about what we're doing: innovation in technology, product competitiveness, this is a series of things we're doing.

In contrast, it's about how to develop several teams and provide a sponsorship service system. I just wanted to tell you how to open up your position and work with the transmission industry. The fourth is how to achieve a strengthening of the multi-region economies and internationalization. So I just talked about those things, and I repeat them: In 2000, we set up this company.

The company was founded in 2000, and I played with it for at least 13 years, or even 20 years, when we were founded in 2000, the company was not very good at the whole environment, but we lived in 2000. I insisted on buying a factory in Taiwan, I insisted on splitting up in mainland China to do organizational changes, we here in 2024, we have three teams to tell you that everyone has made a good report, and we are talking about working together at any time. Compared to 2020, I boldly invested in aerospace in the enemy country, and I have to fight for the huge shareholder Sumitomo City of Tianyang Aerospace, I bought it, but let me tell you that today is not to look at the factory, he knows it is not to do it. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time. We are a group of people who have been living in the country for a long time.

Last year YOY was 27%. Profits were good. Profits were good. Profits were good.

British. He speaks in this industry. Aerospace industry. Of course, there is manufacturing. There is also business. We are very happy.

"We have come to the end of the earth, and we have come to the end of it, and we have come to the end of it, and we have come to the end of it, and to the end of it we have come to the end of it, and to the end of it we have come to the end of it, and to the end of it we have come to the end of it."

It is impossible to say from the beginning. We are talking about stamping parts. It is important for us. When we invest in a company, this company is related to the automobile production.

I believe you can see. The rise of automobiles in mainland China. The rise of electric vehicles. Already exploded. German car factory. Including BMW.

Includes Massive Benz. Includes Benz. Includes Bolch. Even England. This is called Static. Or what.

I forgot the name, it's terrible, but the truth is, why do we do this, or go back to say, "We're thinking about something for a long time."

We invest in Germany. We talk about science and technology later. It is specialized in making molds in the past. Precision molds are the main, but they are also because of the overall environmental impact.

It's been a while, and we all know it, and we all know it, and there's a lot more to it.

There is nothing in this world that we do not know, but that which we do not know, and that which we do not know, and that which we do not know, and that which we do not know, and that which we do not know, and that which we do not know.

Or, "We have done this, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it, and we have done it."

So we made it to the top of the list, and we made it to the top of the list, and we made it to the top of the list, and we made it to the top of the list.

There is a new part of the home. There is also the stamping part. There is also the extraction part. This is what we are talking about in one-stop service. So we do this.

This is the heart of the righteous, and this is the heart of the wicked, and this is the heart of the wicked, and this is the heart of the wicked, and this is the heart of the wicked, and this is the heart of the wicked.

We want to create one. Diverse professional services.

We work together at the same time. We do what we do. We don't do it all. Let others do it.

It's true, it's true. It's the future of the field. Of course, I've been talking about a few things. To localize the organization. Internationalize the profession.

To achieve a diversity of dispersion. Risk dispersed. To actually establish direction. So, let's consolidate. For example, we add the sun to the stone.

This is a good example, and we are actually expanding.

In addition, the horizontal part of cooperation to talk about. Taiwan's industrial center. Including Taiwan's new Wuxi industrial center. We put some suppliers in. The supplier is very small.

But there's his technology. Look for it. He's not going to do it. We're going to do it. He's not going to plan it. We're going to plan for it.

He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is who is who is

Yes. There are localization features. How to strengthen. The most important thing is to get close to customer needs.

Includes this case. TraceMile's case. TraceMile is. We're talking about cars. Electric vehicles have two parts. A charging trolley on the ground.

A charging seat in the car. Now we're talking about charging seats. Actually, it's on the case. We talked about it a year ago. We talked about the case. At that time there were 10 suppliers.

Including the United States, including Europe, including mainland China, as well as Asia. Who are the Asian newspapers? But where is the difference between plastic and a few.

It may be single. Solid is mixed. First of all, we speak in Europe. There are offices.

There are engineers. Connect directly with customers. Understand the needs of customers. We have a factory in Wuxi. How to match.

So now we've got it. above this case. on this case. get the BMW all the series of things. all the series of things. that's not a simple thing. that's one.

That's all. You have to meet the needs of your customers. Now we're a colleague in Europe. He's an engineer, and he's also a guest.

Be involved with the BMW. There is something to change. Here is a good example. Realizing the future in these four words. Continue to optimize. Continue to optimize.

So I said, "This is the truth, this is the truth, there is a thing for a long time, I do not precisely define the market.

The following are the re-arranged paragraph verbatim transcripts: [2193. 64-2195. 72] is not incubation of in-house entrepreneurs. [2195. 72-2207. 92] This is what we have been doing. [2197. 92-2200. 24] Everyone may know why. [2200. 24-2202. 04] Although I am alive now. [2202. 04-2203. 12] But let's just say.

[2203. 12-2204. 44] is only one person. [2204. 44-2205. 96] is not possible. [2205. 96-2207. 56] is relatively speaking. [2207 56-2209. 88] Especially in China. [2209. 88-2211. 76] We train a lot of colleagues. [2211. 76-2212.] They are not called old.

[2212. 76-2215. 08] Call internal entrepreneurs. [2215. 08-2216. 28] Prospective entrepreneurs. [2216. 32-2217. 80] We nurture them. [2217. 80-2219. 88] Become more. [2219. 88-2221. 72] Think with us. [2221. 88-2223. 04] Follow us to work together.

[2223. 04-2224. 76] Give them a piece of heaven and earth. [2224. 76-2227. 04] Satisfies the entire internal and external resources. [2227. 04-2229. 00] Satisfies the continuous growth needs of customers. [2229. 00-2230. 28] Become a global profit. [2230. 28-2231. 64] This is also the case. [2231. 64-2233. 08] Includes our designs in Thailand.

[2233. 08-2234. 60] It also meets customer needs. [2234. 60-2236. 20] The customer says the Chinese mainland. [2236. 20-2238. 24] It is more expensive except for what India goes to. [2238. 24-2238. 92] There are tariffs. [2238. 92-2339. 36] It does not matter. [2239. 36-2240. 44] We go to Thailand.

[2240. 44-2242. 08] Thailand has no tariffs. [2242. 08-2243. 76] Thailand has no tariffs. [2243. 76-2246. 12] Become a strategic partner of the global force benchmark. [2246. 32-2248. 04] Talk about the world. [2248. 04-2250. 80] Our peers are ahead of us. [2250. 80-2251. 72]

[2322. 72-2324. 52] This is not more than physical strength. [2324. 52-2326. 00] but collective wisdom. [2326. 00-2327. 00] This system. [2327. 00-2329. 84] We call the so-called Industry 4. 0 system. [2329. 84-2332. 12] I have an intelligent operating system. [2332. 52-2334. 44] Almost 5 years ago.

[2334. 44-2335. 56] We have made a lot of money. [2335. 56-2340. 16] To cooperate with Siemens systems. [2340. 16-2342. 96] Also because we are a few in this industry. [2342. 96-2343. 96] This is the case. [2343. 96-2346. 68] There is such a whole-world thinking. [2346. 68-2348. 16] So we get it.

[2364. 24-236. 40] If the factory in Wuxi speaks of it. [2365. 56-2367. 16] Here for everyone to take a look. [2377. 76-2379. 12] Below is a picture of Wuxi.

[2379. 12-2379. 80] is near. [2379. 80-2380. 44] behind. [2380. 44-2381. 68] seems to have nothing to do with the back. [2381. 68-2383. 24] It is a Wuxi factory. [2387. 24-2379. 48] This is possible. [2387. 48-2391. 56] It is a Wuxi factory.

[2391. 56-2392. 04] [2392. 04-2392. 88] No one has seen. [2392. 88-2394. 20] Most of them are automated. [2394. 20-2395. 40] Why can I make a factory here. [2395. 40-2396. 60] Can live. [2396. 60-2393. 80] I do not need money.

[2397. 80-2398. 88] I'm going to pick up the order. [2398. 88-2401. 32] I'm reducing more and more automation. [2401.32-2402. 64] This new factory in Wuxi. [2402. 64-2404. 60] 42,000+ square meters. [2404. 60-2407. 04] Two plants. [2407. 60-2408. 96] It's not enough for everyone.

[2420. 28-2421. 72] Except for machining. [2421. 72-2425. 20] There is also a requirement for surface treatment cleanliness. [2425. 40-2429. 28] There is a arrangement for 20,000 cities without a city. [2429. 28-2431. 92] I will talk to you in the end. [2431. 92-2434. 00-2436. 80] Business operations are a very difficult thing.

[2436. 80-2437. 80] A very important point. [2437. 80-2438. 80] You speak today. [2438. 80-2439. 48] not to tell him. [2439. 48-2440. 24] You do today. [2440. 24-2441 24] You do tomorrow. [2441. 24-2444. 16] You tell him a whole concept.

[2444. 16-2445. 40] To the whole concept. [2445. 40-2448. 08] You have to start from the greatest source. [2448. 08-2449. 44] The purpose of the enterprise is where. [2449. 44-2450. 40] The enterprise's business mission is what. [2450. 40-2445. 92] What is the business philosophy of the enterprise. [2452. 92-2445. 64]

[2454. 64-2456. 40] The strategy of the enterprise is to export. [2456. 40-2458. 08] The business strategy of the enterprise. [2458. 08-2460. 76] In the export so-called the goal of the year.

[2465. 32-2466. 40] How to do it. [2466. 40-2467. 96] So it is important to talk about it. [2467. 96-2471. 12] We have come along the way to talk about these things. [2471. 12-2473. 32] If this then there will be a book. [2473. 32-2475. 64] This is what Li Jitian said. [2475. 64] The transformation is growing. [64-2477. 48]

[2477. 48-2478. 48] I am in this book. [2478. 48-2481. 64] I want to be in a lot of advanced can refer to this book. [2481. 642482. 56] It is important. [2482. 56-2484. 64] You need to have an overall thinking. [2484. 64-2486. 20] You are at your core. [2486. 20-2489. 60] You are talking about a business philosophy you are pursuing.

[2495. 28-2496. 84] Sustainability potential. [2496. 84-2499. 56] This is the biggest difference between implementation and general company. [2499. 56-2501. 40] The most important thing you should look at.

[2501. 40-2503. 48] This is a traditional organization. [2503. 48-2506. 24] Tradition is in our penetrating. [2506. 24-2509. 20] Everyone wants to maximize the benefit. [2509. 20-2510. 40] Relative. [2510. 40-2512. 76] Its supply chain is Sanmin Forever. [2512. 76-2513. 92] You are useful today.

[2525. 24-2526. 88] Find a partner to break the rack. [2526. 88-2529. 76] That's what we're talking about. [2529. 76-2532. 84] You two are the marathon runners. [2532. 84-2537. 76] You two very strong people and four people. [2537. 76-2539. 28] He's the picker. [2539. 28-2541. 44] You think who wins the last time.
