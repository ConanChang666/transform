We look at the revenue performance of 2024, our revenue is 164 million, this is our revenue in 2024. Although it is not a new high, but it is also our record high, our performance in 2022 is 1814 million, so we will also strive to make this new high not only in 2022. Since the two years after 2022, we have just mentioned that the director's meeting here requires us to take a deep assessment of the order, that is, we hope we can focus some of our capacity resources on the products with relatively high profitability, as far as possible to maximize the effectiveness of our entire group, so even though our performance is not innovative, but we can see on the performance of the example above, we see that in the gross profit margin, we have risen from 5.9% all the way to 2023.

It is not easy to see that the short-term part of the cash, now we see that in 2022 75 days, 2023 here to increase to 82 days, that is also the impact of that rising interest rate, of course, that the client will ask us to long their customers, plus some spare material, etc., but we have also made a lot of efforts in the background, such as we are also going to adjust the high-end bill payment, so that he can be the same with the customer here, that is also on the inventory plan, we have also made a lot of effort, so the whole week short-term, from down to 68 days. **Please note: ** **

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with the text fragments provided by the user and sort them into paragraph-based texts. First of all, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the original text must be kept intact.

For example, the first part is about financial reporting, followed by the sustainability and future plans, and then the social contribution part, which may need to be handled separately. Next, I need to analyze the corresponding sentences for each timestamp, ensuring that they are properly combined into paragraphs without changing the order. For example, the first paragraph may include discussions about the 2022 financial data and dividend policy until the "above is our part of the financial report" is mentioned.

It is important to note that some sentences may have a longer interval after [910. 00-912. 00], which may mean that the speaker is switching from financial reporting to another chairman's report. This time, it is necessary to clearly segment the phrases that may be separated by line or space. In addition, some sentences may belong to the same paragraph in syntax or logic, such as a continuous explanation or an enumeration, should be merged together. For example, the six directions of sustainability can be combined into a paragraph, separated by commas or semicolons in each direction to maintain consistency. At the same time, it is necessary to check whether there are duplicate or redundant content, but according to the user's requirements, no sentences can be deleted, even if there are duplicated and also need to be retained.

Finally, make sure that the entire document is formatted with appropriate punctuation and paragraph separation to make reading smoother. For example, each major part is separated by empty lines, with sentences under the same topic using a period or a junction. During the process, there may be some uncertain places, such as if some sentences belong to the same topic. This time it is necessary to judge based on context and logical relationships, to ensure that the transition between paragraphs is natural, and the content is coherent.

At the same time, confirm that the order of the timestamp is correct and avoid the occurrence of the time error. Finally, generate the final paragraph verbatim to ensure that all the user requirements, including not to delete any content, maintain the order and integrity of the original word, while making the document structure clear and easy to read. </think> Here is a compiled paragraph verbatim (totally retain all the original sentences, only adjust the paragraph format): [Financial Report Section] This year was only mentioned in 2022, and this is actually a new high point that we should give 10 years.

This is where we can see that in the past 10 years we have maintained a minimum inadvertent 0.2 dividend regardless of the status of our transit. So we can see that the proportion of dividend distribution in some cases will be abnormally high this year. Of course, this year we are in the process of abolishing the situation, our dividend will certainly not disappoint investors, so on March 12th, our board of directors have passed the allocation of US stock 0.6, which is also three times.

Next, we asked the Chairman of NIF for a report on our regional development and results. Dear Colleagues, I am NiF, and I am the Chairman of the Jinbao Group, and now I am here to report on the overall development of the Group. The first interest this year will be put down for us for the first time. Last year we were in the environmental part of our Group inspection goal has been completed, and the FBI review has passed.

We have also supported the participation of young people from the Association to help the youth in Tianxiang full-town. We have also joined hands with the country to promote the organic development of culture. The efforts we have made in the past few years have been with that we have also been the first to become a top 100 organic company. The results of these operations have also been recognized by the Group, and the governance of our business has been a double achievement. In the next three years, our Group will continue to promote sustainable development in the six main directions of sustainable sourcing and sustainable design and social mobilization.

We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint by 5% each year, and we expect to be at our Taiwan operations headquarters by 2030. We use more than 10 natural green energy sources globally in renewable energy use in 2025 and this year. This part of our in-house carbon power will increase the carbon intensity per metric tonnes this year compared to last year. This is one of the key aspects of our sustainable business supply chain, so our goal is to establish sustainable procurement processes and improve supplier visibility.

In order for the outside world to understand more about our work in DNA-T, we will continue to publish the coverage that we have given to all of our relationships in the future. Good for us, the influence of social inclusion is at the heart of our community. We will continue to promote the establishment of the industry's tantalizing arts and cultural finance staff participation in the field of agricultural education, in addition to the recently mentioned loan premiums and the expansion of the civic society, and here I also especially want to share with you the report that our company has intermittently migrated the feed platform for the disadvantaged elderly in the past 40 years to this day.

In fact, we have sent more than 20 million food boxes. This year we will continue to do the same. This year we have also cultivated a lot of engineers for our industry. We will also start from our industry to expand the cultural worries and interests of our old stores.

It was a bit late to build it, but it was already mass production, so we were waiting for the time. That was us in Brazil, because our base was in Marrakesh, but we were operating on this base for our customers, and we were going to mass production in April. All of us, whether the camp equipment was produced, or the application for some necessary documents, has already been completed, so we will increase our resources and we will join our operations. And of course, the US production part, you know that our base is in San Diego Asia, we have found a suitable site, about a five-minute drive, so we will have two bases in San Diego Asia, and the other one is the base that is currently in production, the other is the base, we have been processing in August, so we will arrive on April 2nd.

So, we have a lot of companies in our group, and they also want to say that we can work together to create some results, so this is very simple with you to report our whole years of the situation, and say that we are in the product, the whole part of the production, how do we achieve it all to experience the present trend, above reported here, thank you, thank you to the manager, we will go into the question and discussion, then welcome all the students to the media, if there are any schools, welcome to discuss with us, thank you, the host of this period ended, please please please please please please please, if not, thank you today, today will come to the end, thank you.
