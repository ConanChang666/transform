We have also called on a spokesperson, Mr. Wu, to present a briefing for us. Thank you for an invitation to this exchange. This year has been very creative.

"This is the time when all the people will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together, and we will be gathered together."

So let me tell you a few things about this topic. That's it. Of course, the first thing we did last week has a judiciary. So let's just talk about the performance of the whole first quarter.

The second is to talk about our second quarter and a outlook throughout the year. The third is to talk about the long-term outlook of Honghai. I think the first quarter of the good and I think that the income statement is what everyone sees. That revenue is 1.64 trillion. That gross profit and net profit is the absolute amount.

That's a new all-time high this quarter. That's what we see in this tri-green section. The gross profit margin is a bit diluted with the net interest rate. The reason is that as more and more AI servers contribute a lot.

This has a slight impact on the performance of the gross profit margin. But for net profit, it is still a very big help. So let's take a look at this green. Basically, the operating profit margin is with this net interest rate.

It can also be seen. Although this gross profit margin is affected by an AI server. But in the case of a substantial increase in revenues, operating profit margins can basically benefit from this scale. So it can be basically maintained in a stable or growing condition. Net interest rate is of course the same.

As long as this revenue growth. Net operating interest rate is basically stable or flat. Net operating interest rate is of course also followed up. So you can see the part of YOY. From this operating income this business benefit.

There is basically more than 20% growth. The net profit growth is relatively large. This is because there are more expenditures outside of the industry in the same period last year. This year is basically an income outside of the industry. Well, I think this quarter is year-to-year.

We have been given this, and we have seen it, and we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it; we have seen it, we have seen it; we have seen it, we have seen it.

I want to focus more on this change in this product portfolio. That was a year ago. This consumer smart product is about 46%.

Revenue or growth. Our cloud network products have increased from 26%. 8% to 34%. So the two growth scenarios are in this product change in this age. This product change in this age. The proportion of this product is getting closer and closer.

That will be in line with what we mentioned earlier this year. It may be later in the quarter. It is also possible that the revenue ratio of the combination of these two products is very close. It will make us more average in the combination of product customers.

Strong growth is also from the cloud network products in which the AI server is located. The other thing we want to add is this original. Because the original is a relatively high gross product, so the two products are basically constantly rising with our expectations. The year-round part is because the exchange rate of Taiwan dollars has been in the past.

It's about 8 to 9%. So basically. The income part of the US dollar is basically. Expected is. But because the relationship of exchange rate is then converted to Taiwan dollars, there will be some impact on its revenue.

We have a clear understanding of God's plan for us and what He has planned for us, and what He has planned for us, and what He has planned for us, and what He has planned for us, and what He has planned for us.

That's it. The first is of course that we had a judiciary last week. So let's talk about the performance of the first quarter again. That's the second.

Good first quarter. Revenue is 1.64 trillion. That's gross profit. That's what we see.

<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments, sorting them into paragraph verbatim fragments. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so it is necessary to maintain the integrity of the original word. Next, I need to analyze the verbatim fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and content, for example, [738. 14-744. 02]

First of all, I will check by a sentence to see if there are duplicates or places that need to be merged, but according to the user's requirements, no deletions or rewrites can be made, so all sentences must be kept. Then, I will consider how to group these sentences into sections that form a natural one. For example, the parts of the global layout of Hon Hai may need to be merged into a paragraph, while the parts of the AI and electric vehicles have separate paragraphs. It is important to note that some sentences may have overlap or interval in timestamps, but the user does not provide specific context, so they can only be arranged in chronological order.

In addition, some sentences may be logically related to the same topic, such as a merger of locations in Africa, and should be linked together. During the processing process, I will ensure that the order of each sentence is consistent with the original timestamp to avoid disrupting the original narrative logic. At the same time, check if there are missing sentences to ensure that all content is properly transferred. Finally, I will read the entire paragraph-by-word transcript to confirm the smoothness and accuracy of the content to ensure that there is no violation of the user's requirements.

In addition, the user mentions that "do not delete any one sentence" means that even if some sentences do not appear to be connected, it must be retained, which may affect the flow of paragraphs, but must strictly follow the user's instructions. In conclusion, I need to deal with, maintain the original order, reasonable segmentation, to ensure that all contents are fully presented without any modification or deletion.

So there are currently a total of 233 locations and offices in the world. That is, in addition to the increase in the number of locations this year, of course, there is a more special place in Africa that we have all had in fact the first location this year. That is by acquiring a company and then having the African location he owns.

So you may have heard of Honghai selling in the past, not of course, is the speed, quality, manufacturing service, flexibility and cost of this Honghai sale. Remember that Honghai sold these five things, these five are the customers most important. So just mentioned that all these things are related to, such as this flexibility, this speed, etc. This is in line with the needs of customers.

That time, you also saw that we have gradually started to see some progress on the so-called EV track that could make people feel comfortable. So electric vehicles or the automotive industry as a long life cycle and relatively stable industry, this may be also a long-term opportunity for Honghai to provide another more stable force, whether it is in the so-called equilibrium of the product, the balance of the customer, because the automotive industry itself is a relatively stable and long-term industry.

The second step is our AI, and slowly the third step will also appear this EV. Well, the first quarter of the AI saw our server's products, and the part of the AI revenue in the first quarter was more than 50% of the year-over-year growth. We saw the main customer needs continue to grow in the second quarter.

We have seen the whole Yundong network product, the Yundong network product contains two more important areas called the server, and the other one is called the network product. This large product category accounts for 34% of Honghai. In that product category this server may account for 8 to 9 percent, this AI server may or may not have reached nearly 50% this year. Well, yesterday, Liu Dong in this keynote mentioned this factory, so before everyone thought that Honghai is the physical factory, physical factory. In fact, the whole Honghai AI factory now consists of three plants, one is the physical factory, the other is the virtual factory called the digital Tune, and the AI Factory.

So you can imagine that now some people in the future are talking about AI production, or if the robot is a robot production robot, the same concept is that they continue to run the virtual integration of their mechanism, is the future factory, whether the manufacturing or software industry is the same concept, how to strengthen their competitiveness is basically through such a mechanism.

Another thing, of course, is that in addition to the AI mentioned in the future, the robot actually has a lot of things in the past that we may see...

This is the robot's arm. And so on. But the robot's arm was set in parameters. Then the robot just mentioned the robot.

AI is made by AI. So robots are combined with AI. They are constantly improving each other. There is no need to even participate.

And he said unto him, Take, eat: this is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me, and in remembrance of me.

The robot is so attractive. Good to see this. Bloomberg thinks this is it. 1. 3 trillion. The entire AI market. It's about half there.

The blue part. About half of the 6000 billion belongs to this AI server. Or hardware related to a market. So this market is big. What concept. Now the whole ICT combined mobile phone laptop.

One trillion dollars. This is the AI server. It's out of the sky. Less than a few years. It can reach 65 billion. This is the present semiconductor.

"This is the best of the best," he said, "and the best of the best is yet to come, and the best of the best is yet to come.

Just teaching a video inside the CDMO is used on the drug. We are the CDMS. They call the contract. development manufacturing What. Or organization Contract design manufacturing service for. Design manufacturing services.

We did not have a contract manufacturing service before. We did not design but we did design the car. So we went to Honghua if we looked at it. In fact, Honghua's performance is not good because he has a design service. This is his value added.

OK. That's next. Maybe in less than a few minutes we've been talking about the five things that I've been up to, but our advantage is built on Tie to market and Tie to cost. Tie to market and Tie to cost. So far, our EVM. We've launched nine reference prototypes.

And that's what everyone knows too. Last week was a week of worship. One of them was announced together with customers. We will soon adopt ours. One of them was officially sold in the second half of the so-called Oceania market in the second half of next year. It also represents the development of Honghai in electric vehicles.

The second important must-own is the first must-own that we have successfully mass production of commercial vehicles this year. The first half of the year we reached Model C. The second must-own is our traditional international large-scale car. Large-scale customers will adopt this outsource. It was announced two weeks ago.

That last must-own is. These guests are not only made for Honghai. He will use Honghai's car directly, which may soon be realized.

There are a lot of people out there, and I'm going to take a bike to see the U-bike. I'm going to take the high-speed rail to see this.

It's all on Google. It's all on Google. It's a standalone app. We call it Silo. There's no way to integrate it, so what we do now is work on the platform.

It's all about getting together. So you have to do a lot of things later. You have to go to a place where you can see what you're talking about, where you can go and where he can help you.

So, each company can be on top of this infrastructure platform. To develop. These are what they need. Apply. The principles of these three platforms are laid on the ground.

This zero that Hon Hai has created over the past few decades. Components. Modules. The system assembles on top of this IC software. The four very important solutions. Now, of course, it is based on a large round model called FastBrand.

There may be a next chance to see this FastBrand we first showed at GTC. So the three platforms are based on this FastBrand in principle. Below. FastBrand has these four features, including this one in Lama. Meta Lama model, and so on.

It is an open source model. Well, the last one is. Need to develop so much business. Three platforms. The three platforms. Need to have this FastBrand model.

That's what this NVIDIA Jensen announced in Taiwan two days ago. He followed. Jiang and this Honghai with several partners in Taiwan. Together, this one is the largest building in Taiwan.

The center of computing power. So this part of Honghai will play a role. It is a very crucial role, so it may be said by many investors. Well, there are many markets.

The server is very good, many people buy this.

The first few weeks before, everyone was mad at this so-called. The picture is not right. As a result, the company in the United States said.

Do not ask for anything from them, and do not ask for anything from them, and do not ask for anything from them.

Technology products are about 121 people. Some of them are just going to use one image to generate it. You can use the computing power now. One action and you don't do anything. If you do so much, it's still a business to do.

If every company is doing this, of course, it is not enough.

This is why the current market capital market and this so-called entity supply chain in this demand is not a more complete place where there is no way to communicate. In this industry, we believe that computing power is basically a very powerful demand guest can hope that as soon as you have this AI server, you can get the device as quickly as possible, and the company that provides solution as fast as possible. Now because there is not enough computing power, so he can not launch this solution. This is the first of its kind in the world, and the second is the robot. If you look at this product, we will think of at least 56% of the components we have to supply so many consumer electronics, we can do about 56% AI servers, except for GPU chips, which we do not have a lot of problems in the future. If you want to buy a new car, you can buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, you can buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, you can buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, you can buy a new car. If you want to buy a new car, you can buy a new car. In the future, we will be able to see the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. The next booth of the Hon Hai will be the next booth of the Hon Hai. In the future, we will be able to see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. In the future, we will see the next Honghai booth. The next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai, the next time you can see that Honghai.

From 1907 to 1909, we adjusted the construction of a factory, not the construction of a semiconductor factory. We are OSET, even now advanced windmills. Especially after COVID, there is a shortage of semiconductors around the world. In the past, we saw a very active expansion of semiconductor production.

It's like a 12-inch semiconductor in a conventional process, and the factory won't be able to enter the market in about a dozen. This will put a lot of pressure on our capacity. So in a mature process, the semiconductor in its own capacity is enough. What do we want to do? I want to do it.

We even created a joint venture called Silicon Auto for the car and Celantis, a car brand in France. The company specializes in the design of the car IC. The reason we design is because we can work with our advanced windwear.

This is also one of the applications for software. Now we are more focused on the application, not on the wind power itself. No problem, we would like to thank you again for your comments. Thank you, our Honghai company's track record is here. Thank you, Honghai company, and our guests for your visit.
