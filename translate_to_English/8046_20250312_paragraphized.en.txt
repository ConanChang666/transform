The following is a transcript of the rescheduled paragraph: Please go to the South Sky Kurt Jiang Bosen Manager to read to us. Now it's time to hand it over.

Then it will be added to the list. Then it will be added to the list. Then it will be added to the list.

Last year, that's ours. Product sellers. We are such a plastic investment. We are mainly. Last year, about 320% fell in January.

Paris. followed. that was more than 2023. fell again. at that time was still subject to adjustments. followed.

With that. Consumer demand. That is, the market cap as of the end of last year is. 22. 7. The region we are producing is. That is strictly the company.

In 2019, because of that time, the relationship between the upper and lower we will have in Kunshan. PBF production line. That will continue in 2021.

It will continue in Kunshan as well. A new PBF production line has been set up. It has been nearly three years since the financial situation.

For example, 2012 is the year, the year, the recent high, that is, there are some other similar.

Benefit. That's it. That's it. That's it. Electric users have improved. That's when it got to 240. 4D. That's when it started to adjust in 23 years.

So, 23 years compared to 22 years, about 34.6 years down. That 24 years here is the adjustment of our network products. Then.

The same is true of last year's sales of AIMC were slightly lower than expected. So last year's 24-year revenue was 23.6%. Last year's market year looked like this. The first quarter was at the bottom.

In the second quarter, we started mass production. CAPEX's loading room. This year, when 2Q was a bit better. So QQ grew.

14. 4%. That third quarter is. Traditional peak season. That plus 800G exchange. Start here. And cooperate with the purchase of mass production.

So the third quarter accounted for a quarter of the growth. 13.2%. The fourth quarter was traditional electronic. E-moleculars. Charge-free e-moleculars. That, especially in game consoles, demand is relatively low.

That's why. 4Q ratio. 3Q went down 14.4%. That's the one that's been around for nearly three years. Cargo revenue boxes are also speaking. 23 years.

Shipping is significant. 22 years coming. Reduced. Same. Just mentioned. That's the impact of stock adjustment.

Then, coupled with the overall ABF over supply. The competitive pressure on the price is also very serious. So we say from 23 years. The operating interest rate is probably from 36.5% in 22 years.

15% goes down. That was the whole year last year. Sales profit is also because our network product demand is relatively weak. For example, the WIM table shows. It must also affect freight.

So last year we actually lost 3.6% in our industry. Last year we talked every quarter. That is, the first quarter is the loss is more serious. First quarter loss. Profit.

The loss of business is likely. 11.25%. The second quarter is AIP. The memory requirements are better. Therefore, the loss is less.

Operating interest rates are 20% negative. The third quarter is a trilateral combination that benefits from the opening of the 800G switch. AIP is because the volume is relatively large. The overall UDR comes up. Then our operating interest rates are about 10% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is.

Affected by consumer electronics single-stage. That UTR has a partner. So we have a rule in the domestic portion of the four seasons. Business interest rates are negative. Negative 5%. That's us.

In the third year, we can see that we are talking about the same thing as the previous year.

Then we have our online account number. Last year, everyone's network was not in development. In fact, the Lord God, the need for investors, is falling.

Consumer electronics has not been significantly improved in the past year. So the proportion of revenue is flat with 23 years. That part of the car is because the price is competitive. And then the sales of the car last year. So the situation is not very good.

Supply chain. Finally. His part is mostly our AE. HP. This part is relatively stable, so the proportion of revenue is bitten.

The direction of the future of our products is based on three generations of products. ABF will continue to cooperate with customers, whether this is the case.

The AI of the client or the disk side of the AI, we will all, and then we will develop.

AI device. Then there is AIC. There is a CPU of C9. There is a processor of that data center. There is a high-speed traffic plan router. There is also a WiFi network chip.

Then we had a nomi in the car industry. The processor version responded to the car. That's what we said. Let's focus on a high-end picture development here in our SIP. That's what we're going to do this year. We're going to mass production together with our customers.

Then, like this reformer, these SIPs. At the same time, we will fight for the Optoelectronics market to start. Then, we will start mass production of some Optoelectronics chip and 5G.

We also began to have some in the satellite field. Some Exposure. BT here will also have some fast satellites. Run to satellite. Receiver application version. That general circuit is coming.

Then, of course, we continue to receive data to drive HDMI to and from the output, and then we start to mass production.

Accelerated cards for AI servers. Then there are network cards for next-generation servers. SERVER products. That's because these power modules also continue to increase demand. We'll open them. Some high-frequency mass of advanced servers then expand us.

The lack of data center applications. Our portfolio. Our operating community is the same next year. There are four.

<think> Ok, now I need to process the transcription fragments provided by the user to convert them from a verbatim format to paragraphs. First, I want to read the user's requirements carefully to ensure a complete understanding of the task. The user emphasizes that the original text content cannot be deleted, rewritten or condensed, so the integrity of the original text must be maintained. Next, I need to analyze the transcription fragments provided. Each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. For example, [515. 52-518. 60] Total product transformation, career transformation, digital transformation and chain transformation.

These sentences look like the content in a speech or conference, which may involve different aspects of a company's strategic transformation. My task is to merge these separate sentences into a consistent paragraph. First, I need to identify which sentences are logically consecutive and may belong to the same topic or argument. For example, the parts of the transformation may include the total product transformation, the business transformation, etc., and then the emphasis on improving the proportion of high-quality products, then the expansion of applications, the development of new new materials, and then the R&D industry product area, the use of AI digital technology to transform operations, expand green energy use, and finally the circulation and summaries.

In addition, timestamps may help understand the order of sentences, but users are not required to retain timestamps, so the conversion can be ignored. During the merging process, to ensure the natural connection between sentences, you may need to add appropriate links, such as "in addition", "at the same time", but the user requests not to change the content, so you can only use the links in the original sentences, such as "then", "that we will", etc. For example, "the application" in the original sentence may need to be combined with the previous sentence "that we will continue to improve some of the proportions of high-quality products", forming a continuous paragraph.

Also, pay attention to the structure of the sentence. For example, the "texture enough" in "and then make our operations more textured enough" may be an abbreviation of "texture enough" or "texture enough", but the user's request is not rewritten, so it must be kept as it is. Similarly, "simple all" may be repeated in spoken language and needs to be retained.

1. Identify the subject and logical relationship of each sentence. 2. Combine relevant sentences into paragraphs and keep them in the original order. 3. Use the words in the original sentence to ensure consistency. 4. Check for missing or format errors. 5. Make sure nothing is deleted, rewritten or condensed.

We will continue to increase the proportion of high-quality products and then expand the application. We will develop new materials a new technology, then go to the company's industrial area, and then continue to use AI to transform some of our operations, and then make our operations more manageable.
