<think> 好的，我現在需要處理用戶提供的逐字稿，並將其轉換爲段落式格式。首先，我要仔細閱讀用戶的要求，確保完全理解任務。用戶強調不能刪除、改寫或濃縮任何內容，所以必須保持原話的完整性。

首先，我會檢查提供的逐字稿片段，看看是否有時間戳或其他格式需要處理。用戶給出的例子中，每個句子都有時間戳，但轉換時需要去掉這些時間戳，只保留對話內容。接下來，我需要將這些逐句的條目合併成連貫的段落，同時保持原話的順序和內容不變。在處理過程中，我需要特別注意對話的連貫性。例如，當一個人開始說話時，可能需要將他們的連續句子合併成一個段落。同時，要注意不同說話者之間的轉換，可能需要用換行或縮進來區分。

但用戶沒有特別說明如何區分說話者，所以可能需要根據上下文判斷，或者保持段落自然分隔。接下來，我會逐句檢查是否有重複或需要調整的地方。例如，在原文中，關於毛利率的部分有重複的句子，我需要確保這些重複的內容都被保留，因爲用戶要求不刪除任何內容。

此外，要注意標點符號的正確使用，比如在句子末尾添加句號或逗號，以確保段落的可讀性。另外，需要注意一些可能的筆誤或口語化的表達，比如“me point”可能是“midpoint”的誤聽，但用戶要求不改寫內容，所以必須保留原樣。同時，要確保數字和單位的正確呈現，例如“$25.2 billion”和“37 to 40%”等。在處理過程中，我還需要注意時間戳的範圍是否正確對應到對話內容，但用戶已經提供了時間戳，所以轉換時只需去掉時間戳，保留對話內容即可。最後，我會通讀整個轉換後的段落，確保沒有遺漏任何句子，並且段落之間過渡自然，符合口語對話的流暢性。總結來說，我的步驟是：1. 去除時間戳；2. 合併連續的句子爲段落；3. 保持原話不變，不刪除或改寫；4. 檢查標點和格式；5. 確保所有內容完整無誤。

這樣就能生成符合用戶要求的段落式逐字稿了。</think> Hello Tony, I am David from JPMorgan. Welcome to join our JPMorgan CEO and CFO conference call in 2025. Can you start to brief your business outlook and the business situation in the first quarter 2025 and the fourth quarter 2024?Thank you, David. This is Tony Chen, the IR Director at Nomadec. Let me first spend a couple of minutes to summarize our key message from our analyst meeting last week. We actually just had our quarterly earning call last Wednesday. First, in terms of the quarter flow, our quarter flow revenue of $25.2 billion exceeded our guidance of $24 to $25 billion, which was helped by some rush orders or subsidy programs, mainly in China for some mobile phones and TVs, but still down around 10% quarter over quarter due to the low scenario as well as some inventory control found in the supply chains. In terms of gross margin, our gross margin of $39.5 billion, and make our guidance of 37 to 40%, but steady downturn basis point from quarter three, mainly due to the product mix change, such as we had a low weighting on the high margin SOC business, as well as the higher material costs, such as from gold. Looking into the first quarter, our revenue guidance is at $26 to $27.2 billion, me point represented about me point quarter over quarter growth. In terms of the momentum from our three business lines, we expect all of three business lines to grow sequentially, but among three,the left side driver will grow fast, mainly due to the benefit of the subsidy program. In China, particularly for TV on the large size. Then followed by the SOC business, which big portion also is coming from the TV related business, will also benefit. Small media side driver still grow quarter over quarter, but to a lesser degree, mainly due to the slow down from automotive supply chains. Among small media side driver, we still expect the online driver for smartphones, and LCD TDI for tablet, who grow quarter over quarter in the first quarter. Let's move into the growth margin guidance. We expect our growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is similar to what we provided for quarter four. But the main point is that we expect the growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is similar to what we provided for quarter four. But the main point is that we expect the growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is a little bit lower than what we just reported for quarter four. However,we feel comfortable to maintain our growth margin in first quarter. As we see a relatively stable or better product mix moving into the first quarter, along with our sound cost reduction effort in the supply chain. Despite,we will still see some annual price negotiation, particularly at the driver space. So let me stop here and back to David. Thanks,Jason. I have some follow up questions. First of all,can you elaborate more about your OLED TDI product pipeline and the competitive landscape and some potential customers that they will sign for this product?Okay,I think we highlighted a couple of features for OLED TDI. As for smartphones,one,everything is on schedule. I think we will start to run back gradually from late first quarter. We expect the customers model will be available in the market during the second quarter. Two,we will provide more updates on OLED TDI as we might have a much better visibility in terms of the demand shipments as well as the opportunity from other customers. Two,in terms of impact,we do expect OLED TDI to generate higher ASP and margins due to the technology leadership as well as some cost saving for our customers. So we do actually expect to see some good momentum from OLED TDI. We do see we have some leadership. We do expect to see some good momentum from our competitors at OLED TDI. As we are one of the very few company to have all the required technology on OLED,on the TDI,on the touch side. Got it. I think you have mentioned about your upside for first quarter 2025.

以下是重排後的段落式逐字稿：。[338.00-344.00] Maybe about the China subsidy and some momentum benefit from Tariq。[344.00-358.00] Do you expect about the some continued momentum from the Tariq and the China subsidy going to 2022 second half 2025?[358.00-365.00] I think I know other names also mentioned about these factors。[365.00-374.00] But if we take a deeper look, I think if look at one by one, mobile phones, mice, we see a little bit from subsidy program in China, but nothing to do with Tariq。[374.00-380.00] As a major exposure to Chinese customer, focus pretty much non-US business。

[380.00-387.00] I think we see maybe the TV sector might benefit a little bit more from this potential Tariq。[387.00-395.00] But nothing more than that。[395.00-397.00] In terms of the second quarter, we didn't provide any preliminary view for second quarter or rest of this year。[397.00-404.00] But we do also expect to see a lot of company specific opportunity into second quarter, such as I just mentioned about the introduction of OLED TDI。[404.00-415.00] But we also see some new project wins or rembub during the second quarter。[415.00-421.00] So it's a little bit too early to provide a comment for second quarter。

[421.00-426.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[426.00-434.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[434.00-436.00] Okay。[436.00-447.00] Can you talk more about what is the most important growth driver for 2025 across those products?[447.00-460.00] I think overall speaking, given our leading position across driver, I think the number one still need to have a healthy and moderate growth for the industry according to different application。[460.00-463.00] Two, over we still see rising adoption。

[463.00-472.00] We see rising adoption of OLED products across say OLED, but also into other segments such as IT。[472.00-482.00] And three, we also see some recovery on the high end and partially maybe help by the recent subsidy programs。[482.00-489.00] I think across phone, TVs and even maybe finally from the noble PC from the corporate side。[489.00-492.00] Then of course, we also see some opportunities。[492.00-499.00] Still share gain from some relative new business, particularly on the OLED driver side。[499.00-508.00] Then lastly, we also see some emerging opportunity at our SOC or some ASIC opportunities。

[508.00-511.00] So I'll put this all together。[511.00-514.00] Also a little bit lower base in 2024。[514.00-521.00] So that's why we are a little bit cautious, optimistic for our growth outlook into the 2025。[521.00-522.00] Okay。[522.00-523.00] Okay。[523.00-524.00] Okay。

[524.00-525.00] Got it。[525.00-534.00] What is your view about the competition for OLED, DDIC, maybe from China and other suppliers and competitors?[534.00-545.00] If you look at the industry data for the smartphone OLED driver, we ranked about number two or three in terms of unique market share about meetings。[545.00-548.00] This the number one is Samsung LSI。[548.00-551.00] We ranked two or three along with another Korean supplier。[551.00-557.00] But I think three or four or five are all Taiwanese companies such as Ziradian, Elite。

[557.00-563.00] So Chinese competitors still relatively small at this space。[563.00-568.00] I think their combined market share is still at about mid to high single digit。[568.00-573.00] So I think on OLED driver, the competition from China is still at early stage。[573.00-578.00] Then shift the gears, they come out of the competition from other Taiwanese company。[578.00-580.00] I think they did have a lot of competition。[580.00-586.00] I think they did have a good momentum from late 2023 and into 2024。

[586.00-599.00] But recently we have gained some business opportunity back from our wider offerings and the release and even upcoming OLED, DDIC。[599.00-609.00] So that's why I think for the Android OLED driver and the smartphone, we do expect to have solid goals。[609.00-638.00] I think is similar to what we seen in the listener review, [638.00-640.60] 您對您的客戶的既有影響,。[640.60-644.80] 以及您如何解決Nomatech的既有影響?。[646.00-648.20] 這是一個運行過程。

[648.20-652.00] 連在他入行前,。[652.40-657.80] 我們開始看到更多討論在供應銀行上。[658.40-662.20] 所以，從我們的觀點上,。[662.20-668.40] 第一，我們想繼續增加我們的業務混合在中國外。[668.40-670.40] 因此，我們有所進步。[670.40-674.40] 我們提出了我們在韓國的新客人,。

[674.40-675.90] 然後到美國。[675.90-677.90] 我認爲這是一個很好的進步。[677.90-679.90] 在供應銀行上,。[679.90-682.90] 我們更加集中於臺灣。[682.90-686.90] 但是我們也逐漸增長了我們的供應銀行的項目,。[686.90-688.90] 包括發行商和配件。

[688.90-690.90] 我們想要更加平衡,。[690.90-691.90] 以處理可能的問題。[691.90-692.90] 以處理可能的問題。[692.90-693.90] 以處理可能的問題。[693.90-694.90] 以處理可能的問題。[694.90-695.90] 或挑戰。

[695.90-696.90] 以處理政治。[696.90-699.90] 但現在，我們已經有很長時間。[699.90-701.90] 因爲我們仍然有很多動作,。[701.90-702.90] 有很多動作,。[702.90-703.90] 至少有些價格,。[703.90-706.90] 例如他們有些負擔,。

[706.90-709.90] 他們可能會在TSNC上提出一些價格。[709.90-711.90] 但是我們是一個充值供應商,。[711.90-714.90] 我們提供我們的充值供應器,。[714.90-715.90] 例如Panel,。[715.90-717.90] 或甚至我們的公司。[717.90-720.90] 所以我們並沒有直接將我們的產品。

[720.90-721.90] 運送到我們的產品中,。[721.90-723.90] 所以我們將在這些情況下,。

我們需要在下個數月內，更加深入地看待美國政府的進行貿易簽證。我們需要在下個數月內，更加深入地看待美國政府的進行貿易簽證。好的，謝謝你，Tony。我覺得這些問題，我們可以結束了。謝謝Tony，謝謝Tony，謝謝Tony，我們下個時間見。謝謝你，David。

再見，祝你有一個好天。再見。
