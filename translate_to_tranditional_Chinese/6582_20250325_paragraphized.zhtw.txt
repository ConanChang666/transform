也謝謝各位在場以及線上的同事先進。我先做簡單的介紹集訓營整股及第四季的回顧。如果有任何問題請大家提出指教。OK 那我進到簡報的第三頁。我們今天大概分幾個部分。我們會有簡單公式介紹產品銷售。

接著說一下營運概況以及未來的重心。我們公司在1979年的時候成立。目前我們人數大概153個人。是一個中型規模的企業。我們在2017年上市之後。就成為證券交易所在屏東少數幾家上市公司。

我們目前所有的廠以及主要的辦公室。通通都是在台灣。我們目前政府在合理的採買計畫。那我們最主要的產品就是合成乳膠。合成乳化聚合的高分子聚合技術是我們的核心技術。那我們上游大概就是石化產業的原料商。

然後我們下游就是各式各樣的合成乳膠的應用。不管是在醫療業或是電子業或是造紙或是環保產業等等。目前我們是全球第七大的低筋乳膠的製造商。我們主要的產品用在這個部分。第一個是醫療檢驗電子用的一次性手套。

接著是紙頁的部分。我們會用在紙張的圖布以及紙張的棉著。同時它也可以是一個環保建材很好的結合劑。因為我們這個是水性的材質。所以是綠色環保無毒的並且是無價權的。不管是在生產或是在產品上的產品。

我們都會使用或是在長時間的10年20年的衰退後。它都不會有環境破裂的產生。當然我們也是電動車的供應鏈之一。東西用在這個停電裝置以及電池的部分。它也是可以配得上用場。目前我們也打進了幾家國際大廠電動車的認證跟供應鏈使用。

我們主要的產品銷售。我們主要的產品銷售。24%是內銷然後其他部分是外銷。大概有七成都坐落在亞洲。主要就是我們大眾使用在醫療。醫療檢驗食品用的這些手套。

手套這種刺青手套它最早是用天然的橡膠。所以這整個Supply Chain的進度都是在東南亞。尤其是在馬來西亞。我們在馬來西亞也有一個技術服務的辦公室。OK我們來看一下2024年。我們在馬來西亞也有一個技術服務的辦公室。

2024年營收是17億左右。比去年同期增長了52%。我們的營業經歷的話。是6400萬的損失。也比去年進步得非常多。這讓我們業外大概有6700萬左右的業外收益。

我們的業外收益主要是來自於。各項經營商品的利息收益。不是一次性的儲分。所以它是非常穩定的。各位先進可以看我們採訪後面的副作。我們最主要持有的都是。

固定收益類型的。產品並且是以台幣資產為主。台幣資產大概佔了70%左右。所以我們也受到外匯影響的衝擊。也是會相對比較小的。這個業外收益是相對穩定的。

那要特別補充說明的說。有關業外收益的部分。我們並不是。一個會長時間的。進行經營的操作。主要因為。

前幾年賺下來的錢。我們找一個合適的地方來做。資金的parking。那未來我們還是會專注在本業。上下游轉頭以及。

產能發展為主。整個2024年的稅前經歷。大概是大致是。所以我們今年股幣政策是發一塊錢。賠的。賺的部分。

結果全數的來配出。那我們來看一下科技的EPS。以及業績和國力的表現。

首先可以看得到。下游中這個年度的部分。就是我們是。2024年成功的轉輝。在本業部分也已經非常接近水平。大家可以看到在這個。

從2023年第一季到2024年的第四季。可以看得到一個。逐步的進步的狀況。那其中在。第三季的部分大家看說為什麼。它立刻跳成正的。

就是因為這個股幣配發的高峰期。所以這個部分就是正的。但是可以看到在2024年第四季。它已經非常接近水平。我們相信。

未來我們會繼續努力的調整來優化我們的產品注冊。那這個部分應該會越來越好的。未來我們發展方向有幾個部分。合成乳膠甚至乳膠以及這個奈米化的產品。主要就是我們的產品。希望可以走向。

這個。健全產品組合並且這個發展高定級型的產品。那在手套部分最主要就是進行改質。不管是抗腐蝕。抗腐蝕然後抗溶性。高強度高彈性的這些的。

那這個部分最主要就是進行奈米化以及自成和原料的。那我們原料上。我們在客戶的。製程上面。它有非常高的穩定性。而且它在清潔上有與水性的關係。

所以它的成本。跟這個製程的循環會相對的。非常容易清潔。環保材質。環保建材跟環保材質的部分。政府的綠色法規。

不。台灣政府或是這個北美地區。日本地區或中東地區的這個環保法規。那包括這個。石檀石器是不可以使用這個塑料。那所以開始有一些。

橄欖膠啊。除了膠的。那未來我們。我們上次聚焦在這一頁的幾個產品。大家可以看到綠色。就是我們現在的。

那這些東西。事實上。它都是可以使用。合成乳膠的方式來進行。OK那總結一下。2024年。
