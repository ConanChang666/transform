<think> 好的，我现在需要处理用户提供的逐字稿，并将其转换为段落式格式。首先，我要仔细阅读用户的要求，确保完全理解任务。用户强调不能删除、改写或浓缩任何内容，所以必须保持原话的完整性。

首先，我会检查提供的逐字稿片段，看看是否有时间戳或其他格式需要处理。用户给出的例子中，每个句子都有时间戳，但转换时需要去掉这些时间戳，只保留对话内容。接下来，我需要将这些逐句的条目合并成连贯的段落，同时保持原话的顺序和内容不变。在处理过程中，我需要特别注意对话的连贯性。例如，当一个人开始说话时，可能需要将他们的连续句子合并成一个段落。同时，要注意不同说话者之间的转换，可能需要用换行或缩进来区分。

但用户没有特别说明如何区分说话者，所以可能需要根据上下文判断，或者保持段落自然分隔。接下来，我会逐句检查是否有重复或需要调整的地方。例如，在原文中，关于毛利率的部分有重复的句子，我需要确保这些重复的内容都被保留，因为用户要求不删除任何内容。

此外，要注意标点符号的正确使用，比如在句子末尾添加句号或逗号，以确保段落的可读性。另外，需要注意一些可能的笔误或口语化的表达，比如“me point”可能是“midpoint”的误听，但用户要求不改写内容，所以必须保留原样。同时，要确保数字和单位的正确呈现，例如“$25.2 billion”和“37 to 40%”等。在处理过程中，我还需要注意时间戳的范围是否正确对应到对话内容，但用户已经提供了时间戳，所以转换时只需去掉时间戳，保留对话内容即可。最后，我会通读整个转换后的段落，确保没有遗漏任何句子，并且段落之间过渡自然，符合口语对话的流畅性。总结来说，我的步骤是：1. 去除时间戳；2. 合并连续的句子为段落；3. 保持原话不变，不删除或改写；4. 检查标点和格式；5. 确保所有内容完整无误。

这样就能生成符合用户要求的段落式逐字稿了。</think> Hello Tony, I am David from JPMorgan. Welcome to join our JPMorgan CEO and CFO conference call in 2025. Can you start to brief your business outlook and the business situation in the first quarter 2025 and the fourth quarter 2024?Thank you, David. This is Tony Chen, the IR Director at Nomadec. Let me first spend a couple of minutes to summarize our key message from our analyst meeting last week. We actually just had our quarterly earning call last Wednesday. First, in terms of the quarter flow, our quarter flow revenue of $25.2 billion exceeded our guidance of $24 to $25 billion, which was helped by some rush orders or subsidy programs, mainly in China for some mobile phones and TVs, but still down around 10% quarter over quarter due to the low scenario as well as some inventory control found in the supply chains. In terms of gross margin, our gross margin of $39.5 billion, and make our guidance of 37 to 40%, but steady downturn basis point from quarter three, mainly due to the product mix change, such as we had a low weighting on the high margin SOC business, as well as the higher material costs, such as from gold. Looking into the first quarter, our revenue guidance is at $26 to $27.2 billion, me point represented about me point quarter over quarter growth. In terms of the momentum from our three business lines, we expect all of three business lines to grow sequentially, but among three,the left side driver will grow fast, mainly due to the benefit of the subsidy program. In China, particularly for TV on the large size. Then followed by the SOC business, which big portion also is coming from the TV related business, will also benefit. Small media side driver still grow quarter over quarter, but to a lesser degree, mainly due to the slow down from automotive supply chains. Among small media side driver, we still expect the online driver for smartphones, and LCD TDI for tablet, who grow quarter over quarter in the first quarter. Let's move into the growth margin guidance. We expect our growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is similar to what we provided for quarter four. But the main point is that we expect the growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is similar to what we provided for quarter four. But the main point is that we expect the growth margin to be at the range of 37 to 40%, which is a little bit lower than what we just reported for quarter four. However,we feel comfortable to maintain our growth margin in first quarter. As we see a relatively stable or better product mix moving into the first quarter, along with our sound cost reduction effort in the supply chain. Despite,we will still see some annual price negotiation, particularly at the driver space. So let me stop here and back to David. Thanks,Jason. I have some follow up questions. First of all,can you elaborate more about your OLED TDI product pipeline and the competitive landscape and some potential customers that they will sign for this product?Okay,I think we highlighted a couple of features for OLED TDI. As for smartphones,one,everything is on schedule. I think we will start to run back gradually from late first quarter. We expect the customers model will be available in the market during the second quarter. Two,we will provide more updates on OLED TDI as we might have a much better visibility in terms of the demand shipments as well as the opportunity from other customers. Two,in terms of impact,we do expect OLED TDI to generate higher ASP and margins due to the technology leadership as well as some cost saving for our customers. So we do actually expect to see some good momentum from OLED TDI. We do see we have some leadership. We do expect to see some good momentum from our competitors at OLED TDI. As we are one of the very few company to have all the required technology on OLED,on the TDI,on the touch side. Got it. I think you have mentioned about your upside for first quarter 2025.

以下是重排後的段落式逐字稿：。[338.00-344.00] Maybe about the China subsidy and some momentum benefit from Tariq。[344.00-358.00] Do you expect about the some continued momentum from the Tariq and the China subsidy going to 2022 second half 2025?[358.00-365.00] I think I know other names also mentioned about these factors。[365.00-374.00] But if we take a deeper look, I think if look at one by one, mobile phones, mice, we see a little bit from subsidy program in China, but nothing to do with Tariq。[374.00-380.00] As a major exposure to Chinese customer, focus pretty much non-US business。

[380.00-387.00] I think we see maybe the TV sector might benefit a little bit more from this potential Tariq。[387.00-395.00] But nothing more than that。[395.00-397.00] In terms of the second quarter, we didn't provide any preliminary view for second quarter or rest of this year。[397.00-404.00] But we do also expect to see a lot of company specific opportunity into second quarter, such as I just mentioned about the introduction of OLED TDI。[404.00-415.00] But we also see some new project wins or rembub during the second quarter。[415.00-421.00] So it's a little bit too early to provide a comment for second quarter。

[421.00-426.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[426.00-434.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[434.00-436.00] Okay。[436.00-447.00] Can you talk more about what is the most important growth driver for 2025 across those products?[447.00-460.00] I think overall speaking, given our leading position across driver, I think the number one still need to have a healthy and moderate growth for the industry according to different application。[460.00-463.00] Two, over we still see rising adoption。

[463.00-472.00] We see rising adoption of OLED products across say OLED, but also into other segments such as IT。[472.00-482.00] And three, we also see some recovery on the high end and partially maybe help by the recent subsidy programs。[482.00-489.00] I think across phone, TVs and even maybe finally from the noble PC from the corporate side。[489.00-492.00] Then of course, we also see some opportunities。[492.00-499.00] Still share gain from some relative new business, particularly on the OLED driver side。[499.00-508.00] Then lastly, we also see some emerging opportunity at our SOC or some ASIC opportunities。

[508.00-511.00] So I'll put this all together。[511.00-514.00] Also a little bit lower base in 2024。[514.00-521.00] So that's why we are a little bit cautious, optimistic for our growth outlook into the 2025。[521.00-522.00] Okay。[522.00-523.00] Okay。[523.00-524.00] Okay。

[524.00-525.00] Got it。[525.00-534.00] What is your view about the competition for OLED, DDIC, maybe from China and other suppliers and competitors?[534.00-545.00] If you look at the industry data for the smartphone OLED driver, we ranked about number two or three in terms of unique market share about meetings。[545.00-548.00] This the number one is Samsung LSI。[548.00-551.00] We ranked two or three along with another Korean supplier。[551.00-557.00] But I think three or four or five are all Taiwanese companies such as Ziradian, Elite。

[557.00-563.00] So Chinese competitors still relatively small at this space。[563.00-568.00] I think their combined market share is still at about mid to high single digit。[568.00-573.00] So I think on OLED driver, the competition from China is still at early stage。[573.00-578.00] Then shift the gears, they come out of the competition from other Taiwanese company。[578.00-580.00] I think they did have a lot of competition。[580.00-586.00] I think they did have a good momentum from late 2023 and into 2024。

[586.00-599.00] But recently we have gained some business opportunity back from our wider offerings and the release and even upcoming OLED, DDIC。[599.00-609.00] So that's why I think for the Android OLED driver and the smartphone, we do expect to have solid goals。[609.00-638.00] I think is similar to what we seen in the listener review, [638.00-640.60] 您对您的客户的既有影响,。[640.60-644.80] 以及您如何解决Nomatech的既有影响?。[646.00-648.20] 这是一个运行过程。

[648.20-652.00] 连在他入行前,。[652.40-657.80] 我们开始看到更多讨论在供应银行上。[658.40-662.20] 所以，从我们的观点上,。[662.20-668.40] 第一，我们想继续增加我们的业务混合在中国外。[668.40-670.40] 因此，我们有所进步。[670.40-674.40] 我们提出了我们在韩国的新客人,。

[674.40-675.90] 然后到美国。[675.90-677.90] 我认为这是一个很好的进步。[677.90-679.90] 在供应银行上,。[679.90-682.90] 我们更加集中于台湾。[682.90-686.90] 但是我们也逐渐增长了我们的供应银行的项目,。[686.90-688.90] 包括发行商和配件。

[688.90-690.90] 我们想要更加平衡,。[690.90-691.90] 以处理可能的问题。[691.90-692.90] 以处理可能的问题。[692.90-693.90] 以处理可能的问题。[693.90-694.90] 以处理可能的问题。[694.90-695.90] 或挑战。

[695.90-696.90] 以处理政治。[696.90-699.90] 但现在，我们已经有很长时间。[699.90-701.90] 因为我们仍然有很多动作,。[701.90-702.90] 有很多动作,。[702.90-703.90] 至少有些价格,。[703.90-706.90] 例如他们有些负担,。

[706.90-709.90] 他们可能会在TSNC上提出一些价格。[709.90-711.90] 但是我们是一个充值供应商,。[711.90-714.90] 我们提供我们的充值供应器,。[714.90-715.90] 例如Panel,。[715.90-717.90] 或甚至我们的公司。[717.90-720.90] 所以我们并没有直接将我们的产品。

[720.90-721.90] 运送到我们的产品中,。[721.90-723.90] 所以我们将在这些情况下,。

我们需要在下个数月内，更加深入地看待美国政府的进行贸易签证。我们需要在下个数月内，更加深入地看待美国政府的进行贸易签证。好的，谢谢你，Tony。我觉得这些问题，我们可以结束了。谢谢Tony，谢谢Tony，谢谢Tony，我们下个时间见。谢谢你，David。

再见，祝你有一个好天。再见。
