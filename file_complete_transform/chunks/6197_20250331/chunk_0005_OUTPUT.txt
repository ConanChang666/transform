所以我們也很期待接下來既有的產品線的同時，這幾年我們耕耘的幾個ORV3的技術高速 整個這樣整合起來，我相信嗯 不管是在越南的工廠跟美國的工廠，我們也都做了很好的準備了，所以不管川普2.0 3.0 我相信JPG都在這一塊的產品布局，我們都有做了一個很不錯很扎實的準備，然後可以迎合 或配合不同客戶的需求，所以大家也可以 等一下Q&A的時間 可以直接針對於 你們有興趣的問題來做一個提問，那今天的產品幾個主要的重點的亮點 就大概是這樣 那最後一頁呢希望你們給我們支持一下 雖然5月有電腦展 AI很重頭戲 但4月我們還是有一個車用啦 車用的電子展 也是我們結合台大的 對科技的 ESG的科技大學 不管是產品啊客戶等等 我們今年也會在4月23號 在南港有展覽 歡迎大家可以多多來力頂指教 那當然重頭戲的5月 就是我們的電腦展 那大概以上是這個部分跟大家分享一下 謝謝 謝謝安子 那我們接下來是進入機會的時間 歡迎大家提問 謝謝 把它回到第一頁有沒有 說第二頁 看到 End TI 我露這個 我想我来补充一下吧 有关于我们怎样市场跟客户 有关于这个图 有关于像server storage 然后再来AI GPU 再来switch POR 再来变它center的cabling 你會看到吗 server本来应该是我们最大的战场 就是做的是0到6的这个机柜里面的 内建产品高速产品 AI GPU也是高速产品内建产品 可是它整个的设计是有别于 之前的这个server到400G之前 反正就从MTX到GB200到300 后面这个AI整个GPU的server的做法 是很不一样的 目前这个部分是比较 大家非常非常瞩目的这一块 当然也是由NVIDIA在主导 那剩下这两块就是POR 就是Top of the rack到data center的cabling 其实这个我们原本在台湾的客户们 都没有办法做这一部分的生意 因为他们没有建造完整的rack 没有做到L11 12以上 那这些大部分都是在SI那里 或者在美国当地在Build 那整个data center的cabling 就包括现在就是说 就是几百柜几千柜挂托档 然后他们的这个便利 怎么做arrange 到他们整个怎么跟switch 整个叫做cluster 整个data center的整个cluster 这个部分以前在JPC在台湾 是比较难于把手伸到很长 伸到国外或是欧洲到美国的客户的做SI的那个 那因为我们最近两年来 我们已经有美国的团队有JPC PT 我们原本那个PT就把它改成为JPC PT 所以这个团队现在就主力就在做这个TOR 到这个data center的cabling 所以在那里我们才有一些外接线光纤 到更多的这个叫做power大power的连接在一起 所以这个的整个公司的营运的走向是这样子的 所以前面的123大概就在台湾做 交给台湾的做ODM 你知道台湾的ODM就是鸿海光大 音乐大 维银的这些公司 那其实如果是到了TOR这些公司的话 就可能是完全不一样的名字 各位可能会谷歌有自己的SI 我們現在在台灣做了一個 我們現在在台灣做了一個 我們現在在台灣做了一個 這個谷歌的SI已經有好幾家在世界各地 大概十家以上 然後當然有另外還有同稱為SI的 在美國Build的應該也是 那个什么Super Michael也算一個 他們也算本水指的 他們也會需求這些大的power 我們就是因為兩年前看到我們美國這個公司 團隊已經具备 然後客戶的需求跟整個 成長的方向 所以我們才去做 大電流 然後再去做這個所謂的 散熱相關產品 然後再來就是光相對的 一些產品 那美國公司也會加大 MTI 為服務就地的客人 我們現在來看看我們現在有什麼樣的 問題 嗯 問題 有法人朋友問一個問題 2024年EPS8.69 相較前一年度YY成長約67% 請問今年是不是有機會達到類似 雙位數YY成長的幅度 雙位數吧 但是因為數據 我們因為不能做這麼仔細的推估 那抱歉 跟這位法人講一下我們沒有辦法 推估或是很精確的 這個有違反我們的 規定 好那下一個問題 有法人朋友詢問 請問公司新開發的High Power Products 跟水冷接頭預計什麼時候會開始出貨 大Power已經開始出貨 而且出貨的狀況已經還不錯了。``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
