<think> 好的，我现在需要处理用户提供的逐字稿片段，将其从逐句切开的格式转换为段落式逐字稿。首先，我要仔细阅读用户的要求，确保完全理解任务。用户强调不能删除、改写或浓缩任何一句原文内容，所以必须保持原话的完整性和顺序。

首先，我会检查提供的逐字稿片段，看看是否有任何时间戳或编号需要处理。看起来每个句子都有时间戳，但用户希望将它们合并成自然的段落。我需要确保在转换过程中不遗漏任何句子，并且保持原有的时间顺序。接下来，我需要逐句分析，看看哪些句子可以合并成连贯的段落。例如，开头的几个句子都是关于设施维护的，应该合并成一个段落。然后关于FDA的要求和新生产线的讨论可以组成另一个段落。

关于新药物的发布部分，用户提到了多个产品，这些应该分段落处理，每个产品单独成句，但保持整体的连贯性。需要注意的是，用户提到的“不删减任何一句话”，所以必须确保所有内容都被保留，包括重复或看似冗余的部分。例如，关于“this year”的重复出现，必须保留在转换后的段落中，不能合并或省略。

另外，要注意句子之间的连接是否自然。例如，时间戳中的间隔可能表示说话者的停顿或换人，但用户没有特别说明如何处理这些情况，所以可能需要保持原样，仅将连续的句子合并成段落，而不同说话者的内容可能需要分段处理。但根据提供的材料，似乎都是同一说话者，因此可以合并成连贯的段落。在处理过程中，我还需要检查是否有任何格式错误或遗漏。例如，最后的感谢部分需要正确分段，确保所有结束语都被包含在内。同时，注意时间戳中的空格或格式问题，如[2237.14-2238.04]和[2238.04-2238.98]之间的连接是否正确。

最后，完成转换后，我会通读整个段落式逐字稿，确保没有遗漏任何句子，所有内容都按照原顺序排列，并且段落之间的过渡自然流畅。同时，检查是否有任何拼写或语法错误，确保转换后的文本准确无误。</think> on the maintenance side of the facilities they are very very new facilities and very well kept facilities when we acquired them we continue to maintain them and make the correct investments on the maintenance of these facilities there are no lines that are getting too old for production but I will say as the flex pro line goes up on the injectable facility we are setting down an older RAB production line which was very small and outdated and as the FDA wants us to improve and have better lines higher quality lines isolator lines in the fill and finish we continue to invest in new isolator lines that not only increase our quality and our adherence for regulatory but also increase our gross margins and our throughput we have the last question also from Yandak could you give us more colors on the new generic drugs to be launched?we have a really interesting pilot with some partners I will give you some ones that we definitely are excited about the one I mentioned before but also we have a GLP-1 product with a partner that we're launching this year cyclosporin we're launching this year and cladribidine which is an exciting product we're launching this year so we look forward to four main products that we're going to launch this year that are much much much higher on the margin and should also increase our total product profile as well on the generic side I will mention I don't know if we mentioned this before but as we continue to rationalize products we as a company we focus on what's most important for our shareholders and what drives more value for our shareholders as we mentioned before we will be rationalizing a lot of products does that mean that there might be a slight slow down on the top line with some of our revenue as we maneuver and into these larger high margin products there theoretically could be so I want to make sure that the investor committee and our shareholders are aware of that and understand that this is planned for us as we expand and become a stronger company with better margins in 2025 thank you Bobby and this includes today's conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect
