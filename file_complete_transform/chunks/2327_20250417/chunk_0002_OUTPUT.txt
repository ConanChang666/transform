We even had a chance to meet up in person with Shibaura management team. In the beginning of April, which we thought was great meeting that allowed us to meet up to the management team and express our sincere intention to collaborate with the company. But I think the latest news has that the Shibaura and data Studies have a very interesting collaboration. го club as the loyal provider toutoloan bekannt。hat a farming community of a¿yadoングb arch.h entering to interest in JOHN some tools in como всёательно想到能够在其中找到产生生殆一种技术外人لantsambit and has gutal exposure to fire시,so trying to describe the impact for the undefined这些事实让我们都非常感到参与而 vill reactive other related to the individual.。The present Elrode kafon大概有一段话说 Ukrainian companies aircrafts flight after early history turn in to support another potential buyer for the company and we're sorry that we didn't really have adequate engagement with Shiba Ura enough to present a better proposal to Shiba Ura so right now I think we will continue to contrive to engage and try to get more color on this proposal transaction.。We do think that there is a significant synergy that could be generated through the collaboration with YAGEO as we have a very very strong global business presence and we do think that our portfolio can be a great match as well so we will continue to pursue this transaction and in fact in today's board meeting we have resolved that we will raise our tender offer price to from 4300 to 5400 yen per share with the May 7th commencement of tender offer date remained in the current state so that's how we would approach this transaction next. Rail, I'll leave it to David for the guidance for the next quarter Thank you, Eddie. And before I guide you the our quarter two outlook I'd like to give you a couple of highlights of our quarter one performance so again if you see our key financial indicators such as top line, bottom line, cash flow, financial leverage all are with very steady growth and improvement and they also they met our Q1 guidance. I think we have communicated with our investor for a long time in the past couple of years YAGEO tried very very hard try to transform ourselves from the standard product focused company to premium product focused company we also try to look for well balanced of the business among the other regions and other product portfolio so we believe that the recent quarter's performance and the improvement are the strong evidence of this transformation. Now the Q2 guidance so if we see the net sales our outlook is the low single digit growth quarter on quarter and we expect that the growth margin percentage and the operating margin percentage will have a slightly increased quarter on quarter and business side we still see the the book to view ratio is above one so solid booking in the backlog to support this Q2 net sales and especially from the AI related by computing high power server and China EV momentum are remaining very very strong so in the next year we hope I think everyone knows that the recent tariff issue and certainly this is very dynamic it can be changed and every day or every week for the tariff increase this is not the first time we have experience to deal with this in the past so inside the company we do have this mechanism to deal with this so we for the time being we believe that. 因此, 这就是我将为您提供的Q2指导。谢谢，哈沃尔。谢谢，谢谢Eddie和David对您的非常理解的评论。
