這兩年客人對這個用保單來做這個傳承啊，做這個安養結合信託的這個趨勢在我們的課程裡面是特別明顯。所以這兩年中保單所以長天期的保單的比重也比較大，那跟兩三年前這種多數性的保單的mix就不太一樣了，所以這方面的這個free income比較高，所以相對的對我們的這個財管所做的這個fund比較大，就在這個結構上面分配到這個長年期的保單的比重比較高，那Mig就放也是在這個基金類型的東西，基金類型的東西因為在這個投資環境底下，因為它種類比較多不管是平衡型的不管是債券型的股票型，所以對我們的課程來講這方面的階層度越來越高，在我們這樣的分中經營的情況底下，基金這幾年的銷售是對我們的客人來講是很受歡迎的一個投資工具。那當然對於下半年來講整個投資市場也比較重大比較不明，可能投資市場的這個不管是債券類或者是這種equal link的這種結構型的商品可能接受度可能比較低，不過對於這個基金的需求還是覺得這個動能應該還會在。那另外，好像是這兩個地方，至關銀行，對您有問到這個我們財管客人有沒有受這個這個labelage的這種financing那這個目前還不是我們的主要業務，就透過金融資產來做槓桿的這種業務，那這樣的outstanding versus我們的整個個人受信的portfolio 0.5%都不到，只有幾十億而已，經過這四五月那個波動以後其實也沒有客人遭受損失，也都這個彈包這個補這個單本的彈包品的情況也都很順利，所以都沒有什麼樣子credit loss的情況，好 OK，那接下來請那個人壽這個就這個精算以及這個商品方面做個回答，那我先來回答跟value有關的問題，其中有一個問題就是提到就是說在這個VIF跟VNB的假設變動裡面，為什麼VIF的經濟假設是一個負的影響，VNB是一個正的影響，VNB是正的影響我們剛剛有提到就是這邊的外幣保單的占比有比較明顯的提升，那因為外幣保單我們主要就是美元商品，那美元商品的投資報酬率假設是比較高，2024年非投資型商品的美元保單的占比是將近51%，2023年37%，所以VNB裡面的經濟假設變動是一個正的input，那但是在VIF的部分這邊經濟假設是一個負的input，主要是因為我們去年有調升部分利變商品的這個宣告利率，所以投資利差會有下調的影響，這個是關於經濟假設的部分，那另外也有投資先進提到就是說我們在這個VIF的變動裡面，為什麼在保單資料變更跟這個精算假設變更裡面都有關於較高脫退的一個影響，那在保單資料變更保單資料差異這邊的部分，主要是2023年年底我們在估有效契約價值的時候，是基於2023年年底的有效保單，那如果這些保單到了24年的時候，可能有一些保單已經它的脫退跟我們當時預估這個脫退的狀況不一樣，所以這個保單資料差異是根據實際的一個data，在精算假設的變更則是當我們已經站在2024年年底往未來的角度去看，那我們認為如果要反映這一段期間的這個較高的脫退的實際經驗，我們也把未來的這個脫退率假設也有做一些下調，讓這個脫退率稍微提高一點，所以這邊精算假設的變更會有負的影響，以上，對不起我中間打個岔，就是剛剛有一個那個同業也有問到這個，沒有，就是問說我們對於這個放款，銀行對於這個放款信用成本還有這個手續費的這個預估，目前都跟第一季沒有改變，那當然如剛剛國總所提的，這一季然後後面當然還有整個這個美國的關稅政策對整個經濟的這個影響，還是有變數的，但是以目前來說以目前的動能來說，我們並沒有這個對於這個guidance有改變的地方，這個一併先做說明，董事副抱歉，好沒問題，有先進在問那個分紅保單市場月區競爭下的策略因應，這個部分，這個保險市場台灣保險市場一直都是很競爭的，今年度因為有更多的保險公司進入分紅保單的市場，所以越來越競爭是在疫情當中，但是我們看我們的那個整個業績好像並沒有受到太大的影響，而且我們公司的策略基本上我們是希望提供給客戶最適當的保單，所以我們並不是說只專注在分紅保單，我們加上其實利便潮汐型商品也都有，所以如果我們覺得有必要因應的時候我們會做一些適當的調整，另外的話關於RBC，我們目前RBC是well above 350%，所以6月底在300%以上應該是沒有問題的，然後還有新紀人提到，負受RBC ratio加到海外發行自債的動機為何，我們主要的動機是希望能夠強化我們的資本，因為未來台灣遲早要跟ICS接軌，如果我們及早因應的話其實是給我們在經營上比較多的彈性，另外的話就是第一季CSM，我們的目標是500億，那我們看第一季的成果其實是on track，所以今年應該有很大的信心可以達成，另外是關於保險利差異，在目前我們的財報上我們沒有揭露這兩個數字，也許以後Avd 17的時候會揭露，我們就投管相關的問題，我一起會總說好了，從一開始大概有先問到說股債的投資的方向是什麼，從股債來說我們先講股票好了，在股市來說，因為第二季以來關稅的影響對於金融市場的影響已經有相當程度的反應，所以股市現在的發展已經逐步的回歸基本面，所以股價就已經浮現了，所以我們還是會持續看好AI的相關類股還有一個各個產業的龍頭股，近來講我們也看到資金有回股市當然也就會有利於這個台股的表現，我們對後市是神聖樂觀，適時的逢低回補股票並持續的一個做區間操作跟實現資本利益的動作，在市來講，我們美國的表現還是穩健，而且在關稅的不確定性還有預算財政還有協商的因素的影響，我們預期長率還是會維持高檔增長，我們後續還是會看機會來配置長天期的債券，目前New Money有大概5.5%到5.7%，這部分是有關於股債的看法，另外就是說，因應第二季以來的匯率波動，我們4月底的NIKI Position已經快速降到19%。**Please note:** The provided text appears to be a transcript of a financial report or presentation, possibly a Q&A
