另外當然就是一些附加價值的一些鍵盤，一些周邊非鍵盤類的，像一些之前跟各位投資先報告了，這些周邊的，像一些觸控還有一些其他的模組類的東西。那這部分其實在去年表現還不錯，相對的毛利也拉得不錯，所以我們去年在這些非鍵盤這些周邊的部分表現還算可以。那今年來講因為這些東西其實都是standalone，我們這些東西將來會布局在東南亞如果直接去生產這些東西，那還有投資先去問到這個整個海外布局的狀況，那這個，在update就是說其實我們的泰國廠跟這個越南廠在去年都陸續進入量產，越南廠更早在前年都陸續進入量產，那布局上面來講應該也都差不多了，包含一些機器設備，那人員的這個，監視，那目前看來今年的產能應該會比去年的產能會提升不少，也就像越南的這個，我們的廠房逐漸利用率會再提高，那泰國也是一樣啊泰國雖然是跟生產這個進入量產時間比較晚，可是目前需求來講的話這個速度看來其實都還蠻快的所以整個越南跟泰國應該今年的應該第一季第二季應該比較，整下半年度不過整個看來成長的態勢是底定的那在整個中國大陸部分應該有一部分的產能還是會移出來，那這個是有關這個IT的狀況，那有投資先問到那個e-bike跟bike的這個Q1方塊跟Q1訂單的能見度，還有它的庫存，這是一個綜合性的問題，那我想我們去年Q4的狀況還是在做一些庫存上的調整不論是在component或者我們整車的，整車的出貨，那目前看到這個調整還是在持續不是只有我們這邊喔那市場上一些大的一些品牌基本上這些去往庫存的狀況都還是在持續的進行中，那預計調整到什麼時候會不會成長的所謂上半年度我們看到一些，一些sign就是說component端其實慢慢開始恢復，庫存所謂，這些落後指標在這個組裝廠啦或者在通路這邊還是有塞到一些貨，那如果在組裝廠這邊的這個庫存回到正常的狀況的話，那如果在組裝廠這邊的這個庫存回到正常的狀況的話，那如果在組裝廠這邊的這個庫存回到正常的狀況的話，我相信那就是一個大概，一個指標，可是目前可以看到一些component的一些，組裝的component的一些supplier，包含我們的一些我們在這些車架當然他的庫存是慢慢就降價了這個，也可以看從，從我們的財務上這些inventory所謂扣除掉那個Globa加進來的其實我們的庫存水是一直在下降，那預期到我們當然期待到今年的下半年度回復到一個比較正常的庫存水位，這個是針對這個，E-bike的部分，那Q1產品線的營收跟展望，Q1其實今年Q1應該還是成長的一個季度啦當然因為加入了Globa這邊，我們預計去年的Q1我們的營收度了51億那今年來講就是這個季度的一個季度啦當然因為加入了Globa這邊，我們預計去年的Q1我們的營收度了51億那今年來講就是這個季度啦當然因為加入了Globa這邊，應該Q1應該營收不低啦不過我覺得還比較大問題挑戰還是在於這個體制的改善，因為去年我們的營收雖然下降但是我們的毛利調整還得益，那今年的挑戰AOT這個部分成長，綠能的這個庫存的區塊還是一個比較大的挑戰，那預期今年的比例上來看各位投資先進剛才我們在財務長那邊的報告，整個綠能跟AOT大概會是一個73比的狀況在2024年，那今年我們來看的話這個綠能隨著，庫存的區塊還有一些自然的成長再加上Globa加進來，應該這個比例會再提高應該是往三成，有機會再往上，整個綠能整個集團裡面最好的時候大概也佔到47%那我們希望今年能夠從去年的三成，落底之後能夠繼續往上，今年應該是在落在三成到四成中間，所以這個大概是今年的一個，整個綠能跟AOT的一個盤勢，那大概有一些投資先進所預提的一些問題我想我就針對這些問題回答到這邊，那不知道線上各位投資先進針對我剛才回答的這些預先提問的問題之外，還有沒有哪些要。```python
