<think> 好的，我现在需要处理用户提供的逐字稿片段，将其整理成段落式逐字稿。首先，我要仔细阅读用户的要求，确保完全理解任务。用户强调不能删除、改写或浓缩任何一句原文内容，所以必须保持原话的完整性。接下来，我会逐句分析提供的逐字稿。注意到每个句子都有时间戳，这可能帮助我理解上下文和结构。例如，开头提到“低成本的這個低價產品的這個競爭”，后面接着销售起伏较大的描述，然后转向第一季的业绩报告。

看起来这部分内容可能涉及不同地区的业务表现，比如亚洲、欧洲和美洲的情况。我需要将这些分散的句子按照逻辑顺序组织起来，可能需要根据时间顺序或主题进行分组。例如，关于SIS的业绩、不同地区的收入情况、ISRP和Alarm Taishan的业务表现等。同时，要注意中英文混合的部分，确保不遗漏任何信息。在处理过程中，我会检查是否有重复或需要合并的句子，但根据用户的要求，不能进行任何删减或改写。因此，必须保持每个句子的独立性，同时通过适当的标点和段落分隔来增强可读性。

例如，当提到亚洲市场时，可以将相关句子集中在一起，形成一个段落，再处理欧洲和美洲的部分。另外，需要注意时间戳的连贯性，确保每个句子的位置正确，不会因为重新排列而改变原意。例如，关于第一季度的业绩和去年第四季度的比较，需要保持时间顺序的正确性。最后，我会通读整理后的段落式逐字稿，确认所有内容都已正确保留，没有遗漏或错误，并且符合用户的所有要求。这包括检查是否有任何句子被意外删除或合并，以及段落之间的过渡是否自然流畅。</think> 【段落式逐字稿】：。

這個低成本的這個低價產品的這個競爭，它的銷售跟起伏比較大。那事實上在今年，剛才我前面在第一季的報告中，其實在今年第一季SIS的業績相對是不錯，但是我們在去年第四季它就是相對表現的是比較差的。So，As you can see among the three major regions, Asia ranked top in terms of revenue and revenue share. This is mainly due to our strong sensitive Arabic business. Meanwhile we also see AMD's Asia business Grew slightly compared to the other two regions. For Europe, Both revenue and share so slightly declined. We just suggest first the EU, The Europe automotive industry is facing challenge from Asia's peer. And second overall European Regions economy was not Was not recover shown as the other two regions. And for American, In recent years SIS is facing strong competition from Low cost Asian product. So our American business Further With TSM SIS revenue. In addition, This first quarter was also affected by the Delay pickup from our SPS pre-buy customers. So we have to be careful about this.
