合成橡胶事业部主要的表现，那在我们先进材料事业部整体来讲必须说仍然充满了挑战，那尤其是我们的美国子公司的这个营运喔。那如果以产品线别来讲，SBS SEBS还有这个Primeturial就是餐配料的这个业务，它的这个获利呢都较去年同期略微衰退，那主要的原因市场竞争、产品组合的关系，还有客户新的产品延迟导入跟客户延迟提货，大概是这几个原因造成的。那相对的在去年表现比较差的SIS今年表现的是比较好，那主要是因为它的这个产品的利差扩大，那单位的边际利润增加，那第一季今年第一季的这个获利状况比去年同期或者上个季度都伟佳，那主要我想是我们的这个原料采购成本大概略低于市价，那加上我们致力于提高平均销售单价，所以造成单价产品的利差扩大。So we support a strong volume. First quarter revenue hit a 10 year high at 10 billion .4 NT dollars and EPS came at 40 cents. The strong result are mainly driven by strong SRD performance, especially benefits for higher ESPR volume. So we probably, well you know almost, we start our Shenhua relocation two years ago. So after two years construction, Shenhua's new ESPR plan successfully commenced commercial production in the first quarter this year. So meanwhile the original all plan will be still operated in parallel for a period of time of this year, which led to the higher ESPR volume. In addition, the healthy nature rubber and butadiene price gap in the first quarter also bolster synthetic rubber price. The other highlight for first quarter is SSBR. So far we only have a lot of SSBR in the first quarter. We have one SSBR production site, which is in Kaohsiung, and its output was totally sold out. So as the EV sales is growing very fast, especially in China, so most of our brand customer pushing us to expand our SSBR capacity as soon as possible. Actually we are planning to expand our SSBR capacity as soon as possible in the existing Shenhua site very soon. For AMD, I would say generally speaking the business overall is a main challenge, especially our US entity TSM. Overall speaking the contribution from SPS SEBS and prime material decline on year on year basis, except SEBS so sound Q on Q improvement in terms of gross profit. The main reason for the decline were mainly due to the market competition, unfavorable product mix, delayed introduction of new product, and the SEBS customer delay is pre-buy orders. But in contrast, SIS performance was slightly better than some period last year or previous quarter. That's due to the widening product spread, and also the Q1 gross profit was benefit from lower grow material cost. So we quickly looked at the financial information of the first quarter. I also briefly commented the main product lines. Next we look at the distribution of the area. From this table it can still be seen that in San Francisco and Asia the revenue or its revenue ratio is still the largest。Of course this reaction is SRD強勁的這個業務。那事實上我們看到這個先進材料AMD的這個營收當中其實亞洲的這個佔比也略幅的增加，這說明了亞洲的這個不論從營收或它佔比增加的一個主要原因。

那歐洲是這裡面在上面灰色的部分是比較明顯的下降，那主要是歐洲的這個因為我們的產品ACBS有一部分很大部分用在汽車，歐洲的這個汽車行業其實面臨來自亞洲的這個同行的這個挑戰，其實這個競爭是蠻辛苦的。當然歐洲地區的這個經濟的疲軟也是部分的原因。那美洲地區的收入因為我們美洲的業務主要是來自我們在美國的子公司地產商貼身，那主要受到這個SIS跟SES我們叫pre-buy預購的這個影響。那我想大家都知道SIS的業務在美國的美洲的業務這幾年受到來自亞洲低價。
