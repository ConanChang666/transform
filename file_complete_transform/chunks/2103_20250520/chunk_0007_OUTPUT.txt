對於商業發展，以及碳排氣減少的挑戰，將會更加困難，但我們努力去遵守這些挑戰，並且承諾達成我們的碳排氣減少目標，在2024年，我們獲得了一些ESG項目，包括TSM項目，是我們美國的銀行，銀行獎，為TSRC烏北聯合投資，在南通，而今年，在我們，TSM，是美國的銀行，獲得ISCC項目，和台灣銀行交易，銀行管理的，我們繼續維持6-20%的成，成長能陳，以他的與，以及小時的項目，維持，時synergy 超過，在產業援軍的挑戰下，台向雲運績效仍然較前一年提升，面對著這些充滿挑戰和不確定的市場前景，台向將會以實際的行動，來強化我們的雲運韌性，同時我們也會加速我們執行重大專案及綠色創新，以維持我們企業勇氣成长的動力，最後讓我描述幾個關鍵點，在2024年，我們展示了我們能夠每年都能够達到業務改善，雖然市場情況非常困難，但市場仍然是一個，不愧是NEGRO，雖然 rere：但是我們仍然蘇值其時，蘇值時間，555，狀態是名語，時，仍然是，縫隙，色，grievance，p s，Orsini，還說滿地，如果租高，umer，以後的行動，我向您的感謝，然後讓我們轉發給我們的，報告人，給他們的評論和回答，謝謝，就完整的說明與總結，在接下來的十五分鐘，我們將進行問答，請與會的來賓，在Zoom網上界面，以文字形式提出問題，我現場復述，並由我們的執行長親自，或指派財務長回答，提醒您可於問題中留下您所代表的機構及聯繫方式，以便我們能針對未能來及回答的問題，於會後與您聯繫說明，現在我們開始問，我們將透過您的聯繫資料，回答今天我們沒有時間提到的問題，首先我先將在會議前收到幾位法人投資人所詢問的問題，全球關稅貿易戰，對公司生產及銷售布局上，目前衝擊是什麼，以及公司有什麼對策，請問，好，首先我先將在會議前收到幾位法人投資人所詢問的問題，全球關稅貿易戰這個議題是大家都關心的，那讓我先做一个比較高層的說明，然後我們請我們的財務長，針對可能比較小的細節給分析，那短期內，我覺得這整個關稅的政策，還是存在很多不確定性，所以一個不確定性狀況下，大部分客戶都抱着一個比較彎彎的狀態，那采购的策略也比較保守，我們會面臨到的，已經看到的，是一些直接跟間接影響，那目前我只能說，總體來說，對台向的影響，其實是比較有限的，因為我們直接出口到美國，其實從亞洲來說，特別從中國大陸出口到美國，是非常局限的，非常少的，然後間接影響，那因為存在不確定性，很難現在到等評估，以目前的狀況，也是沒有太大的變化，那我现在請財務長，針對這個問題再說明一下，謝謝Jill，我想各位投資人，如果注意到，我剛才的報告的事項第三頁，區域別的營收占比，你就可以發現到，美洲地區，當然主要是美國，當然也包含部分加拿大跟南美，美洲地區占台向公司整體營收，大概12個百分比，但每個年度有點不一樣，大概12個百分比到可能14個百分之間，而且這裡面絕大多數的銷售，都來自我們美國的子公司，所以如同執行長剛才說的，我們直接影響，非常少，但並不排除我們有部分，間接影響，也就是說我們，比如說我們的SEBS的客戶，他間接就是我們銷往美國，這部分會有影響，或者我們上海compounding的。**Please note:** The provided text appears to be a transcript of a speech or presentation, possibly a financial report, and contains a lot of repetition and potential errors.
