我想要其實中國大陸的車用要出來。我們也有一些engage，所以其實我們還是有機會，因為他在出來的情況，他們要到國際市場去。所以我相信這個東西我們也是有一點點機會。那大概還在談，那等以後有比較明確的時候，以後再跟大家報告。那另外因為在整個AI伺服器，目前來講像超風有些產品持續成長，那AIP換金槽，我相信這個都是對超風來講都是一個正面發展的一個方向，因為我們產品也有在做，那只是目前來講因為川普的效應，其實剛上任嘛，那未來會變化會多大影響，其實有時候我們還是很難確定。那如果排除這個部分來講，其實我們整體看來講，我們應該在2025年來講，我們的整個營運來講，我相信我們還是有機會成長。

我想，這個是我今天跟各位媒體朋友先進的一個報告，謝謝。不曉得這樣可不可以，謝謝。由於時間的關係，我們再為線上朋友提一個問題。請問立誠，2025年營運的展望如何？2024年第四季有哪些產品需求延後？然後還有關於2025年資本支出的變化又是怎麼樣呢？

我想2025年的展望，還有這個部分我來回答，待會我們資本支出部分由我們總經理他來負責回答，所以我們把這個問題分成兩個部分，那2025剛剛事實上大概有提到了，我想還是把它切開來看，第一個是屬於DRAM，DRAM的話剛剛景氣它本身就上上下下，我們是Q1的時候確實是比較差，但是呢DRAM我們有一個主要的客戶，它在Q2它有要求還蠻大車的產能，當然我們在立正方面我們可以支援，我們也預期在下半年有不同的封裝方式，這個部分因為都牽涉到客戶，還有一些技術的保密，我們都不能在這邊力氣去，事實上它本身的DRAM，可能就不是傳統的封裝方式，但是它的Bandwidth的話可能會，因為不同的封裝方式，它的Bandwidth可能就會比較寬一點，會比起我們的手機，但是還是比那個HBM稍微少一點，但是這種就是所謂應用所謂Cloud Computing，那也有所謂Edge Computing的應用，那NAND來講的話剛剛有講過，Q1的話是比較Slow的，我們也預期這個NAND的話在Q2能夠慢慢起來，未來的所謂Edge Computing也好，或是Cloud Computing也好，對整個NAND的長遠需求還是屬於正面，至於在先進製程上面，剛剛我們董事長有講過，就是說我們在HBM的話，我們這邊的開發事實上在比較就是在2跟2E的部分，我們是Ready的，當然跟客戶，因為這個是所謂的，現在的幾個我們的美國的客戶也好，韓國的供應商也好，他們都是用Lattice version的HBM，就是所謂的3E，甚至明年到4，4E這樣子的Trend，但是它在2跟2E還是非常多的需求，但是這個供應商，它變成它會是屬於比較小型的D-RAM的Maker，這個部分的話，有時候我們Ready，我們客戶還不一定Ready，整個部分的話，我覺得HBM的話，在歷程深耕應該是不是問題，至於跟我們所謂的，那那個原廠，就是美國的公司或韓國公司，跟他們合作的機會，就是所謂我們扮演歐賽的角色，現在這個時候的話，可能還沒有這個機會，但是終究一定會有，當它到HBM4的時候，它可能HBM3，它可能就沒有產能了，那這部分它就必須要Rely on OZ，所以這個是需要時間的，我常常在講就是說，不要，就是說我們應該還是要Ready，就是說機會是給準備完善的人，我想我們歷程就是這方面的，那邏輯方面的話，剛剛講說車用產品在Q1市場不好，那未來的話，我覺得我們還是有很多的機會，所以整個EQ營收的話，我認為市場EQ來講，我們就整個Summer以下，就是Q1的話，我們會比較少，慢慢的希望有更好的機會，其它的Advanced Packaging的話，我們也照我們的計畫在走，朝著成長的方向在前進，這個部分是我們的2025的營運的展望，在接下來我們的那個，我們的那個KBAS部分，我找我們總經理JS來負責回答，謝謝，謝謝經營團隊的分享，以上將完成今日的法人說明會，投資人可透過立成網頁觀看今日法說會的簡報，及影音重播，謝謝大家的參與，敬祝各位身體健康投資順利，謝謝大家。``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
