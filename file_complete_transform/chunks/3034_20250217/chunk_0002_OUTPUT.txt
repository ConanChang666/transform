以下是重排後的段落式逐字稿：。[338.00-344.00] Maybe about the China subsidy and some momentum benefit from Tariq。[344.00-358.00] Do you expect about the some continued momentum from the Tariq and the China subsidy going to 2022 second half 2025?[358.00-365.00] I think I know other names also mentioned about these factors。[365.00-374.00] But if we take a deeper look, I think if look at one by one, mobile phones, mice, we see a little bit from subsidy program in China, but nothing to do with Tariq。[374.00-380.00] As a major exposure to Chinese customer, focus pretty much non-US business。

[380.00-387.00] I think we see maybe the TV sector might benefit a little bit more from this potential Tariq。[387.00-395.00] But nothing more than that。[395.00-397.00] In terms of the second quarter, we didn't provide any preliminary view for second quarter or rest of this year。[397.00-404.00] But we do also expect to see a lot of company specific opportunity into second quarter, such as I just mentioned about the introduction of OLED TDI。[404.00-415.00] But we also see some new project wins or rembub during the second quarter。[415.00-421.00] So it's a little bit too early to provide a comment for second quarter。

[421.00-426.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[426.00-434.00] But I think for 2025, we remain cautious, optimistic and expect to see some revenue growth in 2025。[434.00-436.00] Okay。[436.00-447.00] Can you talk more about what is the most important growth driver for 2025 across those products?[447.00-460.00] I think overall speaking, given our leading position across driver, I think the number one still need to have a healthy and moderate growth for the industry according to different application。[460.00-463.00] Two, over we still see rising adoption。

[463.00-472.00] We see rising adoption of OLED products across say OLED, but also into other segments such as IT。[472.00-482.00] And three, we also see some recovery on the high end and partially maybe help by the recent subsidy programs。[482.00-489.00] I think across phone, TVs and even maybe finally from the noble PC from the corporate side。[489.00-492.00] Then of course, we also see some opportunities。[492.00-499.00] Still share gain from some relative new business, particularly on the OLED driver side。[499.00-508.00] Then lastly, we also see some emerging opportunity at our SOC or some ASIC opportunities。

[508.00-511.00] So I'll put this all together。[511.00-514.00] Also a little bit lower base in 2024。[514.00-521.00] So that's why we are a little bit cautious, optimistic for our growth outlook into the 2025。[521.00-522.00] Okay。[522.00-523.00] Okay。[523.00-524.00] Okay。

[524.00-525.00] Got it。[525.00-534.00] What is your view about the competition for OLED, DDIC, maybe from China and other suppliers and competitors?[534.00-545.00] If you look at the industry data for the smartphone OLED driver, we ranked about number two or three in terms of unique market share about meetings。[545.00-548.00] This the number one is Samsung LSI。[548.00-551.00] We ranked two or three along with another Korean supplier。[551.00-557.00] But I think three or four or five are all Taiwanese companies such as Ziradian, Elite。

[557.00-563.00] So Chinese competitors still relatively small at this space。[563.00-568.00] I think their combined market share is still at about mid to high single digit。[568.00-573.00] So I think on OLED driver, the competition from China is still at early stage。[573.00-578.00] Then shift the gears, they come out of the competition from other Taiwanese company。[578.00-580.00] I think they did have a lot of competition。[580.00-586.00] I think they did have a good momentum from late 2023 and into 2024。

[586.00-599.00] But recently we have gained some business opportunity back from our wider offerings and the release and even upcoming OLED, DDIC。[599.00-609.00] So that's why I think for the Android OLED driver and the smartphone, we do expect to have solid goals。[609.00-638.00] I think is similar to what we seen in the listener review, [638.00-640.60] 您对您的客户的既有影响,。[640.60-644.80] 以及您如何解决Nomatech的既有影响?。[646.00-648.20] 这是一个运行过程。

[648.20-652.00] 连在他入行前,。[652.40-657.80] 我们开始看到更多讨论在供应银行上。[658.40-662.20] 所以，从我们的观点上,。[662.20-668.40] 第一，我们想继续增加我们的业务混合在中国外。[668.40-670.40] 因此，我们有所进步。[670.40-674.40] 我们提出了我们在韩国的新客人,。

[674.40-675.90] 然后到美国。[675.90-677.90] 我认为这是一个很好的进步。[677.90-679.90] 在供应银行上,。[679.90-682.90] 我们更加集中于台湾。[682.90-686.90] 但是我们也逐渐增长了我们的供应银行的项目,。[686.90-688.90] 包括发行商和配件。

[688.90-690.90] 我们想要更加平衡,。[690.90-691.90] 以处理可能的问题。[691.90-692.90] 以处理可能的问题。[692.90-693.90] 以处理可能的问题。[693.90-694.90] 以处理可能的问题。[694.90-695.90] 或挑战。

[695.90-696.90] 以处理政治。[696.90-699.90] 但现在，我们已经有很长时间。[699.90-701.90] 因为我们仍然有很多动作,。[701.90-702.90] 有很多动作,。[702.90-703.90] 至少有些价格,。[703.90-706.90] 例如他们有些负担,。

[706.90-709.90] 他们可能会在TSNC上提出一些价格。[709.90-711.90] 但是我们是一个充值供应商,。[711.90-714.90] 我们提供我们的充值供应器,。[714.90-715.90] 例如Panel,。[715.90-717.90] 或甚至我们的公司。[717.90-720.90] 所以我们并没有直接将我们的产品。

[720.90-721.90] 运送到我们的产品中,。[721.90-723.90] 所以我们将在这些情况下,。
