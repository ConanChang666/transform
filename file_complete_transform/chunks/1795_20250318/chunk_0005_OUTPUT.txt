and that financing cost decreased about eleven percent from five hundred and twenty six million in twenty twenty three to four hundred and sixty nine million in twenty four, primarily due to higher interest income from a significantly larger cash position. So other gains increased about eleven percent driven by investment income as well as favorable foreign exchange movements between the US dollars and the Hellene's dollars. And the company's effective tax rate remains stable at around twenty percent. So overall, that earnings grew twenty three percent to approximately five billion dollars, translating to an EPS of nineteen point thirty five. And the board has recommended a cash dividend of five point seventy three per share, up from the four point sixty six per share last year. Representing a year year increase of twenty three percent on cash dividend. And the total dividend payout is estimated to be approximately one point five billion dollars, or about thirty percent of last year's net profit. And the remainder will be retained to fund future positions, expanding our global footprints, investing facilities and R and D, and of course, reserved for the future. So that's the those that is all aligned with our consistent dividend policy of the past few years. And the average yield of the proposed dividend is one point. Sorry, two point one two percent comparing with one point sixty five percent last year. We'll be on to the next slide. So now let's take a closer look. At our revenue and twenty twenty four. So in Asia, our business grew by about five percent overhaul. Korea added about one hundred and sixty four million in revenue, reflecting approximately three percent growth. Key brands in Korean marketplace show very strong momentum, and with QC mere growing almost thirty seven percent year over year, and mercy loan up forty two percent and a VC growth of forty two percent. So we're looking at a three percent growth. And a Vista, which is also process friends rising about twenty five percent. However, this was partially offset by lower revenue for commodity generics, as well as income from the royalties and licensing. So as well, the depreciation of Korean won against Taiwan dollars had the fact of muting the growth in terms of reported currency, which is Taiwanese dollars. So, in Taiwan, our domestic business grew about four percent, reaching approximately two point five billion in twenty twenty four. About sixty eight percent of Taiwan's revenue now came from brand products such as CLS, Cluster, Linta and so on, while the generics made about the remaining one third of for the revenue. Our brand portfolio grow approximately zero point three percent, and the main reason was the price. Erosion on Linta offsetting growth in other segments, including the growth in a cluster of process and the Zip, Zelka, which is the new generation of new chemical entity in a small cell lung cancer. And our Southeast Asian cluster delivered approximately one billion in revenue in twenty twenty four, increased from only two hundred and seventy nine percent. And the total revenue of our cluster was approximately two point two billion in twenty twenty four, supported by contributions from our future brand and the full year of combined high operations. So, we are now looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. So,our export businesses grow by about fifteen percent, with the US adding nearly a billion of revenue, and the rest of the world outside of the US contributing additional two hundred and forty five million in revenue.
