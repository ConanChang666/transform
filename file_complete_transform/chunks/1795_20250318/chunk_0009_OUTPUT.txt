we do have a very significant amount of inventory just outside the US border in a lot this is a bonded warehouse make sure we have any solid lead you know these products can be cleared in the US custom in the matter of a week andso we see in the near term tariff or no we don't see any you know particular concern andof course in the longer term we can react to any real threat I mean I emphasis on real threat by moving the manufacturing to the US for example just as we created the backup manufacturing site in Europe and this amount this amount of manufacturing is very high and we're very concerned about it I mean we're very concerned about it and this amount this amount of manufacturing is very high and we're very concerned about it this option is among many options that we are evaluating andyou know depending on� económicamente umed chips computer chips so i mean it is not a unique situation for lotus but you know as i mentioned we are evaluating a number of potential solutions depending on how the threat will come and you know one of them should be enough to get us ahead Pedro do you have anything to add to that no not really ok so next is about our southeast asia strategy and our goal for the southeast asia market and also why we select southeast asia specifically but not china market especially china market has very is a land market for it's merits so i'll take this question i mean why we select the southeast asia obviously uh it's a highest growth cluster of markets in asia if you see i mean if you compare with china if you compare with also with korea taiwan southeast asia is definitely the growth champion i refer to markets like especially vietnam thailand philippines malaysia so that's why we are focused there also we what we have is that there is a the companies are the business is quite fragmented there is a lot of local companies which are lacking capability when it comes to developing product manufacturing obviously with some deficiency on quality lacking network to in license products what we are doing for example from u s companies because they don't have again they're not they're not in the market they're not in the market again network they don't have reputation so it takes a lot of time to to bring this so i think this creates always the opportunity for us what we are planning to do i think we discussed this on one of our previous meetings is that we want to have southeast asia similar to the level of korean Taiwan combined and we have done already important milestones we have achieved important milestones in two thousand twenty four what we promise they were alpha choice and there is more to come so i think we are on a very good track there so of course the strategy there will be more on the product acquisition portfolio positions in licensing of course also and i'm not also excluding m&a yeah as a more parallel to know m&a rather than just buying a local company why didn't we say like china i mean obviously there's a i mean first of all china's market is i think in my opinion more about big pharma local industry so i don't see any successful international company among our peers with success in china
