In the light of my revenue grew almost two billion, almost sixty percent year and year. While generic suboxone declined by one billion Taiwanese dollars, or about thirty percent, due to intensified competition. Outside the US, growth was driven by demand of our lead amyloid in Europe and in Latin America, and very strong performance of binarbin soft gel, and as well as a launch in early markets of the generic, and as well as a launch in early markets of the generic, which is a prostate cancer treatment. So, next slide. You can see our revenue sources remain very diverse and balanced. In twenty twenty four, forty eight percent of our revenue came from export outside of Asia, while fifty two percent came from our Asian home markets. The US continues to be our largest single market, contributing about forty two percent of our growth. Our growth revenue, and followed by Korea and Taiwan. Oncology remain our cornerstone, and accounting for nearly half of our total revenue. While CNS, Premium Care, Lifestyle each contributed about twenty percent. Now, I think it's time to give an update on the performance of our obesity market in Korea, which is a very important obesity market globally after the US. Our flagship product, Qsymia, maintains its very strong market position, despite the launch of Novo Nordic's next generation obesity treatment, WeGovie, that was launched in Q3 last year. As we expected, WeGovie largely, we are the largest, we cannibalize the sales of Novo Nordic's early product, which is also a GLP-1 treatment called Succenda, while the prescriptions for Qsymia remain relatively stable. The significant lower cost compared to GLP-1 therapies has been a key differentiator, particularly for a treatment like obesity, which requires continue monthly dosing. And this trend in Korea also mirrors our partners' experience in the US, where Qsymia has successfully competed with the larger and broader range of GLP-1 options. And now, finally, let's talk a little bit about cash and debt. In 2024, the company generated a total of $1.5 billion in cash. The company's net cash from operations before paying taxes and interests. The net cash from operations after the payments of tax and interest came to approximately $6.2 billion, which is a $4.5 billion increase from prior year. And we closed the year with a robust cash position of almost $6 billion. The company's net cash from operations after the payments of tax and interest came to approximately $7.4 billion, which is very much consistent with that of 2023. With the EBITDA growing over 20% from the $6.4 billion the last 12 months, versus the 2024 12 months of $7.8 billion, our leverage ratio improved from 1.49 times in 2023 to 0.94 times in 2024. So, our business also showed a very high EBITDA margin of 42%, underscoring our very strong profitability and the position of Lotus as one of the most profitable companies in the industry today. So, with that, I'm going to turn back the floor to Petar to talk over the outlook of 2025 and beyond. Okay, thank you, Bertur. So, talking about the future, I mean, we have a significant number of launches, which is coming up in the next six, seven years. You can see here, more than 80 products are scheduled to be launched from 2025 to 2032. The year of launches will be 2026, where we have 17 products overall, combination of BD and R&D and 2018 products. The outer years, the numbers are less.
