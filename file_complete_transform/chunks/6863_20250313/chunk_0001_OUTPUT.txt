It's great pleasure to meet everyone here. We want to report our result of 2024 and also share about our view of the coming year. So in 2024 was a very important year to Ryzen RFID. We achieved the many targets we set up a couple of years ago. First, those cases we have been looking for many years already has the feedback and at the same time we explore our capability in both Yangzhou facility and Taipei facility. We purchased the new land in Hanoi in Vietnam and the construction is in process now and also we enlarge our warehouse in Los Angeles of United States. At the last, we try to improve our manufacturing process the new equipment and the new material and this project is very well done so far and it's all affected to our financial statement. 2024年對永道是相當重要的一年，我們在多年前設定的一些主要的專案，在去年都開始逐漸的開花結果，那也直接反映在我們的財報表現之上。比方說像從2020年之後所開啟的一些新的專案，那在去年也開始有訂單實際的出現。我們在去年呢也進一步的增長了揚州廠跟台北廠的產能，那因為產能的擴張，也能夠及時的補上我們訂單的增長。我們在越南的河內，去年也展開了新廠的計畫，那目前希望在今年Q2的時候，整個的construction能夠完成。

在美國大倉的部分，在去年我們也進一步的擴大我們在美國倉儲的體系。有關於新材料新設備，以及新的生產製程的更新，對我們在去年的經營成績，我們可以。好，抱歉喔。所以如果說在2024年跟2023年比較，我們在sales revenue的部分達到了46億新台幣，那增長了71%。在Gross Margin的部分呢，我們達到了32%，增長了2.7個百分點。在Next Income的部分達到了8.5億新台幣，那這部分跟2023年相形之下，增長了將近90%。

So if you compare the sales revenue between 2024 to 2023, we achieved 4.6 billion Taiwanese dollars that increases more than 70%. And the Gross Margin part, we achieved 32% that increased almost 3%. And in the Next Income, we achieved 850 million Taiwanese dollars compared to 2023 that increased almost 90%. If you just focus on Q4 over 2020, in 2024 the sales revenue we achieved 4 billion that increased 60%. The Gross Margin, because we increased the Taipei facilities manufacture process, so the Gross Margin is around 28% that decreased almost 3%. But the Next Income, we achieved 260 million compared to 2023 that increased almost double. We are very great to see the result. If we can look at the time as a longer distance, we compare the past five years. When I keep our Gross Margin between 29% to 32%, and about net profit rate we controlled it between 16% to 80%. We will try our best to keep a strategy and hope they will be delivered in the coming years. 去年達到新台幣11.36元，那相信2023年的6.17元之下呢，我們成長了80%。在美股淨值的部分呢我們達到了美股84元，那比較在2023年的70元呢，大概增長了20%。在股利的部分，我們在上個星期的董事會通過決議，在今年會派發美股5.5新台幣的現金股率。那在ROE的部分呢，去年達到了14.7，相較於2023年的9.7，大概70%。然後在ROA的部分從8.4增長到11.6，也只有30%左右。So if we can look at the more detail, we can compare the EPS. We increase this from $6 to more than 11%. This increase more than 80%. And you compare the book value, we increase it from 70% to 84%. It's increased more than 50%. And about the cash divided, this year we will deliver per share $5.5. And about the ROE we increased from 97% to 14.7%. And about the ROA we increased from 84% to
