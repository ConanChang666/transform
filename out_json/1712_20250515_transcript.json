    "毛利率同期比增加了2.77個。你可以看我有簡單的提到。它就是產品組合的關係。加上職保事業的毛利提升。營業利益率跟稅後淨利率。跟去年同期比看起來都是差不多的。",
    "接下來負債比的部分。Q1的負債是49.2%。Q1因爲有宣告股利分配的關係。所以它通常Q1的負債比。都會比年底的負債略爲提高。但是如果一樣都看第一季的同期比的話。",
    "其實今年的負債比還是有比去年同期減少了2.1個%。接下來股利分配的部分。新農公司一直以來都是以。維持穩定的獲利。穩定的股利政策爲目標。2024年的EPA。",
    "也是2.5%。董事會的決議也是分配2.5%。發放比例是100%。殖利率是5.9%。也已經在4月16號發放。以上是股利分配的情形。",
    "以上說明。非常感謝經營團隊精彩的簡報。接着是意見交流環節。如果各位先進針對以上的內容。有任何問題。歡迎透過聊天室的功能。",
    "將您的問題寫在聊天室。我會將您的問題轉述一遍。在這之前我們有收集到幾個提問。我這邊作代爲提出。",
    "首先想要請教經營團隊。新農今年各個季度的展望。以及毛利跟費用是如何。能否分享。謝謝。謝謝各位先進的提問。",
    "首先說明。新農公司並沒有公告財務預測。所以對未來的展望。依照交易所的規定。不會有明確的說明。我們來看1到4月的營收。",
    "剛剛提到的。包括整個新農公司一直以來。所發展的營業項目。還有營收。還有在全球各地的比例。都是相當的分佈均勻。",
    "然後整個營收也是很穩定。我們有內銷有外銷。看今年1到4月。營收跟去年是相當。如果細分到比較細的部門。有增有減。",
    "用這個趨勢來看的話。對未來的展望。我們還是依據這樣子一個穩定。穩定的趨勢來發展。至於在毛利方面費用方面。剛剛提到過。",
    "在第一季。整個費用除了獨立實驗支出比較增加。事實上獨立實驗支出。算是一種研發。之前在法國會上。我們有跟各位分享過。",
    "植物保護這個產業需要持續在。全球各地。註冊。有了註冊纔有藥證。有藥證纔有營收。有營收纔有利益。",
    "所以我們一直持續在做。藥證登記的工作。藥證登記的工作。在前面有很大塊。是做獨立實驗。獨立實驗用白話講就是證明。",
    "這支藥對土壤。對空氣。對人是沒有影響的。這個藥才能夠上市。所以我們花很多的預算。來做各項藥證的準備。",
    "所以今天第一季的費用有增加。也是算這種藥證的登記。防疫來講那類似一個研發費用。所以整個展望未來。各季的發展。從過去我們所有財務報表來看。",
    "對未來我們還是一個穩定的發展趨勢。謝謝。謝謝發言人的解答。如果聊天室有。如果各位先進有任何問題。那就歡迎透過聊天室的功能留言提問。",
    "謝謝。感謝先進提問。現在全球最。投資人最想了解的課題。應該就是關稅跟匯率這兩個議題。",
    "首先來講關稅。我們有全球分佈的情形來看。我們全球分佈很均勻。針對美國的客戶。純粹的客戶。剛剛看到是北美洲是。",
    "剛剛的簡報內容裏面。整個美洲是佔15%。但事實上是。如果因爲南美有我們自己的子公司在這裏。所以說再把它拆開的話。事實上我們在純粹在美國的營收。",
    "佔集團的合併營收比例。首先說明並不高。第二個。因爲他的交易條件很多種。簡單來講。假設關稅有所影響的話。",
    "都。所以關於關稅這個議題。目前從4月8日以來到現在。評估對整個公司財務上。無重大影響。好。",
    "這個匯率的問題。剛剛的簡報內容有提到。臺灣佔53%。中國佔13%。這兩個佔比66%。這些都跟美元沒有相關。",
    "在中主要是人民幣在交易。在臺灣當然。所以扣除66之後。當然有34%很多美元。因爲這些美元。所以我們對外銷售是美元報價。",
    "但是我們的進貨也是用美元計價。所以我們收美元付美元。所以以上說明了這些。所以以上說明。所以以上說明。謝謝。",
    "謝謝。如果各位先進。沒有進一步的提問的話。那我們本場就到這邊告一個段落。",
    "那今天非常感謝信榮股份有限公司的經營團隊，那也感謝各位先進的參與，那慶祝各位投資順利身體健康謝謝好的謝謝羣一姐你認證， 也謝謝各位投資先進；信榮公司謝謝大家。謝謝大家。"

    "First of all, I would like to ask the management team. The outlook for each quarter of this year, and how the gross profit and expenses can be shared. Thank you for your advance questions.",
    "First things first. New agricultural companies do not announce financial forecasts. So the outlook for the future. According to the rules of the exchange. There is no clear explanation. We look at revenues from 1 to April.",
    "Just mentioned. Including the whole new farm company has been around for a long time. Business projects that have been developed. There are also revenues. There are also proportions of the world. All are fairly distributed.",
    "Then the whole revenue is also very stable. We have domestic sales. Look at this year from January to April. Revenue is quite the same as last year. If you split into smaller divisions, there is a decrease.",
    "This is what we see in this verse: \"And it shall come to pass, that in the end we shall see the glory of God, and the glory of his name, and the glory of his power, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might, and of his might.\"",
    "In the first quarter, the entire cost was increased in addition to the cost of independent experimentation. In fact, the cost of independent experimentation was a kind of research and development. We had shared it with you before in France.",
    "Plant protection is needed for this industry. Around the world. Registration. With registration, there is a drug certificate. There is a drug certificate to have revenue. There is a profit.",
    "So we have been doing it all the time. Drug registration work. Drug registration work. There is a lot of block in front. It is an independent experiment. Independent experiment in spoken words is proof.",
    "This drug is on the soil. It has no effect on the air. It can only be marketed, so we spend a lot of budget.",
    "So the cost of the first quarter of today has increased. It is also counted as the registration of this drug certificate. In terms of epidemic prevention, it is similar to a research and development fee. So the whole outlook for the future.",
    "We have a stable development trend in the future. Thank you for the speaker's reply. If there are any problems in the chat room, please feel free to leave a message through the chat room function.",
    "Thank you. Thank you for asking the most important question in the world right now. Investors need to know the most important topic. It should be tariffs and exchange rates.",
    "Let's start with tariffs. We have a global distribution. Our global distribution is very uniform. For U.S. customers. Pure customers. Just see that it is North America.",
    "Just inside the briefing. The whole Americas is 15%. But the fact is, if South America has our own subsidiary here. So let's break it apart. In fact, we are purely in the US revenue.",
    "The first is not very high. The second is because it has a variety of trading conditions. In short, if the tariffs are affected.",
    "All. So about tariffs on this topic. Since April 8th to the present. Evaluation of the entire company financially. No significant impact. Good.",
    "This is a problem with the exchange rate. Just mentioned in the presentation. Taiwan accounts for 53%. China accounts for 13%. These two accounts for 66%. These are not related to the US dollar.",
    "Most of them are renminbi in trading. In Taiwan, of course. So after deducting 66. Of course, there are 34% of the US dollars. Because of these US dollars, we sell out of the US dollars.",
    "However, our incoming goods are also priced in US dollars, so we have to pay in US dollars, so this is explained above. So, please explain above. Thank you.",
    "Thank you, if you're moving forward, there's no further question, we're here to tell you a paragraph.",
    "Thank you very much to the management team of Shun Rong Co., Ltd., and thank you for your participation. Thank you for your certification."
