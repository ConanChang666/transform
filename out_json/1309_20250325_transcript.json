    "<think> 嗯，用户给了一个任务，让我帮忙把逐字稿整理成段落式的逐字稿。首先，我得仔细看看用户的要求。用户强调不能删减、改写或濃縮任何内容，只能调整标点和换行，合并同主题的句子，必要时加一些连接符号，比如逗号、句号，但不能添加新的内容。然后，我注意到用户提供的逐字稿片段都是重复的同一句話，總共有大約2070秒，每秒都在呼籲點讚、訂閱、轉發、打賞，支持明鏡與點點欄目。這看起來像是一段很長的結尾畫面，可能在視頻結束時不斷顯示這個信息。接下來，我需要按照規則來處理。",
    "首先，檢查是否有說話者，但這裡好像沒有，只是一句話不斷重復。所以，我只需要把這些句子合併成段落，每段3–6句，用空行分隔。但因為內容完全相同，合併的方式可能需要將多句合並成一段，或者根據主題切換來分段。但在這裡，主題是一致的，所以可能只需要將所有句子合並成一個段落，或者分成幾個段落，每段包含多句。不過，根據規則，同一段落內不得逐句換行，所以我需要把這些句子連接起來，可能用逗號或句號分隔，但因為每句都是同一句話，可能需要用句號分隔，然後用空行分隔段落。但仔細想想，可能更好的方式是把這些句子合並成一個段落，因為內容完全相同，重複多次。",
    "所以，我可以把它整理成一個段落，裡面包含多次這句話，用句號分隔，然後用空行分隔開。或者，根據規則，每段建議3–6句，所以我可以把每3–6句合並成一段，用空行分隔。例如，前三句合並成第一段，接下來三句合並成第二段，依此類推。但因為句子完全相同，可能更合理的做法是把它整理成一個段落，裡面包含多次這句話，用句號分隔，然後用空行分隔開。或者，直接把所有句子連接在一起，用句號分隔，形成一個長段落。但根據規則，同一段落內不得逐句換行，所以我需要把這些句子連接在一起，可能用句號分隔，形成一個段落。",

    "請不吝點讚、訂閱、轉發、打賞支持明鏡與點點欄目。依此類推，直到所有句子都被整理完畢。但這樣做可能會有很多段落，因為總共有大約2070秒，每秒一句話，可能需要分成多個段落，每段3–6句。這樣會更符合規則，避免段落過長。",
    "另外，需要注意使用中文全形標點，句末要補齊適當的標點。因為每句都是獨立的句子，所以應該用句號結尾。總結一下，我需要把這些重復的句子整理成多個段落，每段包含3–6句，用空行分隔，句末用句號結尾。</think> 請不吝點讚、訂閱、轉發、打賞支持明鏡與點點欄目。請不吝點讚、訂閱、轉發、打賞支持明鏡與點點欄目。請不吝點讚、訂閱、轉發、打賞支持明鏡與點點欄目。",

    "<think> Well, the user gave me a task to help me organize the transcription into paragraph transcription. First, I have to look at the user's requirements carefully. The user emphasizes that it can not be deleted, modified or condensed any content, can only adjust the point and line, combined with the theme of the sentence, if necessary add some connection symbols, such as commas, sentences, but can not add new content.",
    "First, check if there is a speaker, but here it is not like, just a sentence repeating. So, I just need to consolidate these sentences into paragraphs, each paragraph 3–6 sentences, separated by an empty line. But because the content is exactly the same, the merging method may need to consolidate multiple sentences into one paragraph, or to split into several paragraphs, each containing multiple sentences. However, according to the rules, there is no need to concatenate sentences in the same paragraph, so I need to concatenate them with a comma or a comma, but since each sentence is the same sentence, it may need to be separated by a period, and then an empty line.",
    "So, I can sort it into a paragraph, which contains multiple sentences, separated by a period, and then separated by an empty line. Or, according to the rules, 3–6 sentences per paragraph, so I can combine every 3–6 sentences into a paragraph, separated by an empty line. For example, the first three sentences are combined into the first paragraph, and the next three sentences are combined into the second paragraph, and so on.",

    "For example: Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots. Please like, subscribe, forward, reward support mirrors and dots.",
    "Please like, subscribe, forward, and appreciate the support of mirrors and dots. This is done until all sentences are finished. There may be many paragraphs to do so, as a total of about 2070 seconds each sentence may need to be divided into multiple paragraphs, each paragraph 3–6. This will be more consistent with the rules and avoid paragraphs being too long.",
    "In addition, it is important to use the Chinese all-in-one punctuation point to fill the appropriate punctuation point at the end of the sentence. Because each sentence is a separate sentence, it should end with a sentence. To sum up, I need to organize these repeated sentences into multiple paragraphs, each paragraph contains 3–6 sentences, separated by empty lines, and ends with a sentence.",
