    "<think> 好的，我現在需要處理用戶提供的逐字稿片段，將其轉換爲段落式逐字稿。首先，我要仔細閱讀用戶的要求，確保完全理解任務。用戶強調不能刪除、改寫或濃縮任何一句原文內容，所以必須逐句保留，同時將它們組織成連貫的段落。",
    "首先，我會檢查提供的逐字稿內容，注意到每個條目都有時間戳和對應的句子。我的任務是將這些句子按邏輯順序排列，形成自然流暢的段落，同時保持原句的順序和完整性。例如，用戶提到公司成立時間、上市情況、員工數量等信息，這些可能需要分組在一起。接下來，我需要識別哪些句子屬於同一主題或邏輯單元。例如，關於公司成立和上市的信息應該放在一起，而關於產品認證和開發的部分應單獨成段。同時，注意時間線的連貫性，比如從2022年到2024年的項目進展。",
    "在處理過程中，可能會遇到一些重複或需要調整順序的句子。例如，用戶提到“MD7貨品證據是202420246”出現了兩次，需要確認是否爲重複或需要合併。此外，有些句子可能時間戳有誤，比如“[48.80-52.18] 公司成立在97年的12月20號”，這裏的時間戳可能與前一句有間隔，需要檢查是否屬於同一段落。",
    "另外，用戶提到“品質系統”部分，涉及多個國家的認證，這些信息應集中在一起，按國家或認證類型分類。產品項目部分，如快篩試劑、血糖檢測等，需要按功能或客戶反饋分組，確保邏輯清晰。在轉換過程中，要特別注意時間戳的正確性，確保每個句子的位置符合其時間順序。例如，關於流感快篩試劑的開發，從2022年到2024年的進展應按時間順序排列，避免混淆。最後，完成初稿後，我會通讀整個段落式逐字稿，檢查是否所有原句都被正確保留，沒有遺漏或錯誤，同時確保段落之間的過渡自然，符合邏輯。如果有不確定的地方，可能需要進一步確認，但根據用戶的要求，不能進行任何改寫或刪除，因此必須嚴格按照原句處理。",
    "</think> 以下是整理後的段落式逐字稿：。[0.00-6.06] 謝謝各位來參與。其實今年就是每年的初會一年要做兩次，所以通常都是在第一季的季報結束之後，這個強勢度出來了，就會讓我覺得接下來我們在第三季或第四季都會再辦第二次。[24.88-28.40] 其實今年，你們看這個簡報，以前的簡報都看過，就這麼簡單。公司在新浮浮學院區，然後我們朝鮮有一個廠，然後在蘇州跟美國都是貿易公司。公司成立在97年的12月20號，然後在2000年的6月13號上市上購，然後之後有一年就再上市，那目前的持收值總額是10億，那總市長兼總經理是省縣市博士，截至今年的4月底，公司的員工是661人。",
    "[77.76-79.40] 接下來是公司的嚴格，這中間就不用多說了。那我想就是講2022到2024，2022就是我們有成立一個免疫風險科，主要就是在做快篩試劑，這個科目是設在這個討論場，然後開始我們在12月，2020的12月底，我們已經取得這個討論服務的QMS認證公佈，我的產品這裏找到，聽說是這個月底纔會拿到，所以上個星期，所以我們聽了實在是覺得很忌妒。[123.74-126.26] 接下來就是20232024，我們就積極在申請這個MD7，叫五國的認證，就是美國加拿大巴西，還有日本跟澳洲，我們分兩年兩次把這個MD7五國法會認證取得了。那接下來是這個，有一個我們跟意大利的客人合作這個ICU用的CGM，我們現在臺灣的GMBA也取證了，然後歐盟QMS也都過了，他現在也是隻差一個產品證還沒拿到，快拿到了，他取的是MDR，就是醫療院所用的，那這個MD7是我們的MD7貨品證據是202420246，他現在就是在等產品證，在這個過程當中，他也在找他的客戶，帶領客戶找。[183.06-187.48] 那再來是我剛剛講的流感快篩試劑，我們是先做了AV流，A流跟B流的感冒的快篩試劑，他現在因爲AVC，現在C又進來了，所以本來我們也要做AVC，那現在這樣子看起來，AVC還是要做，就是AV流再加快這個COVID，這個就應該要趕快做出來，因爲現在做出來，其實可能是以取證的時間，應該是要到明年纔會拿到這裏。[220.52-223.18] 那再來是這個，這個MCS適合一個多功能分析，分析以獲得那個2020年的臺灣健評獎，在今年的年初的時候取得這個健評獎。",
    "那接下來是公司的品質系統，品質系統呢就是有臺灣的TFDA，歐盟CE，美國的MDA，中國的NMPA，這個他們新的一個DEM代稱，再來是巴西跟加拿大跟日本，那這五國就是所謂的MVCET，以後我們就一次認證，五國都會通過這樣子。[270.06-274.06] 再來是這個公司的產品項目，其實沒什麼變化，有一些單品，就所謂的單品，這個專業快篩檢測，除了這個是已經開始賣一陣子，我們還有幾個單品在做，那這些做出來以後當然，那個是主要是應應客戶的要求，所以我們在看它，所以我們不會，我們也在考慮做出來以後，到底要不要放進來，那還是就是依客戶的需求，給客戶用這樣，能力的量，真的還是沒有血糖的量多，主要都是比較屬於專業用的，醫療月手用的，那這個就是多功能的，發泄水的自由品牌的東西，就是這個多功能的解決，那這個就是我剛剛講的，我講的就是，我說一個多功能分析理念，它主要就是有，最重要是它有這個糖化血色素，它這個糖化血色素，在我們來講算是第二代，我們之前有一個糖化血色素是第一代，那現在目前開發這個是比較新的第二代。[345.06-348.06] 然後再來就是這個，Mipro-Argumin,Pretinamide 跟那個Azure，這個主要就是給這個腎功能，對通常糖尿病早期都要去篩選你的腎功能有沒有什麼問題，所以那我們就會做，把這幾個結合起來，所以在一些診所，它不用大力的儀器，它只要用這臺機器，就可以深度瞭解糖尿病人他到底腎功能這邊的病變開始了沒有，這邊就可以提早去注意它的一些，除了血糖以外，還有腎功能的檢測，可以預防它再變嚴重這樣子，那這個這兩個產品也是，也賣了一陣子，也是醫院專用的，就是這個是血酮，然後是我們賣歐洲螺絲種代理，那這個下面這個是血糖血酮，是我們自己在內消醫院，六大醫院都有在推廣，所以就是主要就是測血糖再加血酮，那現在羅士金說他血糖也有點興趣想要加進去，因爲我們就是這樣子很慢的在推廣，因爲走醫院專用的產品，其實要推很慢，所以要客戶他們覺得可以做，那我們就願意配合他們做，然後他們也看到我們國內這邊產品做的蠻穩定的，所以他們才持續就想說可以再繼續往下去開發，然後他們也有在增加一些吸取項在這裏面，所以到時候產品就會越來越多這樣子，不是隻有血糖。[463.06-468.06] 那這個是這個血紅素，這個是血紅素，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是血紅素，下面這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這個是乳酸，這兩個產品，除了就是表示它是專業用的，那血紅素其實捐血中心也會用，還有醫院的產品也會用，醫院的產品也會用，那股酸也會用得到，就是急診或是急性的病變的時候都需要測到這個乳酸，就是急診或是急性的病變的時候都需要測到這個乳酸，就是急診或是急性的病變的時候都需要測到這個乳酸，就是急診或是急性的病變的時候都需要測到這個乳酸，好 再來就是前面我們這麼多的品項。",
    "[521.06-523.06] 我們全部把它加起來。[523.06-525.06] 放在一臺機器上面。[525.06-527.06] 我們自己內部。[527.06-529.06] 我們自己內部甚至叫發肥育。[529.06-531.06] 很多的單獨的品項。[531.06-533.06] 都可以放到這個機器裏面來測。",
    "[533.06-535.06] 都可以放到這個機器裏面來測。[535.06-537.06] 可是呢其實客戶不見得會發現。[537.06-539.06] 全部放在裏面。[539.06-541.06] 因爲不是。[541.06-543.06] 每一個區域。[543.06-545.06] 它還有。",
    "[545.06-547.06] 醫療的。[547.06-549.06] 醫療的。[549.06-551.06] 醫療病症。[551.06-553.06] 其實不見得每個國家都一模一樣。[553.06-555.06] 那有的可能會比較偏好省。[555.06-557.06] 有血糖。",
    "[557.06-559.06] 像日本血糖的量。[559.06-561.06] 糖尿病人並沒有那麼多。[561.06-563.06] 那主要他們。[563.06-565.06] 喫的比較。[565.06-567.06] 簡單一點。[567.06-569.06] 那可是像印尼聽說。",
    "[569.06-571.06] 他們喫的很甜。[571.06-573.06] 所以他們糖尿病人其實是蠻多的。[573.06-575.06] 還有肥胖。[575.06-577.06] 這些都可能會造成血糖。[577.06-579.06] 還有肥胖。[579.06-581.06] 一些。",
    "[581.06-583.06] 像那個三酸一酸油脂。[583.06-585.06] 一酸一酸這邊都會有一點。[585.06-587.06] 影響到這樣的。[587.06-589.06] 所以這個就會看我們。[589.06-591.06] 我們的各國的代理商。[591.06-593.06] 他覺得他需要的肥胖是什麼。",
    "[593.06-595.06] 我們就會去幫他做組合。[595.06-597.06] 是不一定一方而已。[597.06-599.06] 可能會五合一或。[599.06-601.06] 或幾分幾這樣的。[601.06-603.06] 可是我的機器就是可能是一臺這樣子。[603.06-605.06] 可是我的機器就是可能是一臺這樣子。",
    "[605.06-607.06] 你就不要開發太多臺。[609.06-611.06] 那這個就是快三世紀。[611.06-613.06] 那快三世紀。[613.06-615.06] 之前我們就是有這個。[615.06-617.06] 之前我們有開發那個新冠。[617.06-619.06] 就是新冠。",
    "[619.06-621.06] 抗原快速檢測。[621.06-623.06] 那時候申請的證是。[623.06-625.06] 就是有那個。[625.06-627.06] 臨時的證用的。[627.06-629.06] 所以像今年。[629.06-631.06] 爲什麼大家會反彈。",
    "[631.06-633.06] 就是說有人三天就取診了。[633.06-635.06] 因爲那裏面還要做很多的臨牀實驗。[635.06-637.06] 還有那個。[637.06-639.06] 你的病毒菌是不是已經有取的。[639.06-641.06] 而且做過那些病毒檢測。[641.06-643.06] 這些。",
    "[643.06-645.06] 所以我們都覺得不可思議怎麼可能三天。[645.06-647.06] 所以還有臨牀實驗。[647.06-649.06] 你要有免費就要達到一個量。[649.06-651.06] 你才能可能得到一個結果。[651.06-653.06] 那這個我們現在。[653.06-655.06] 因爲我們也在開發ABC。",
    "[655.06-657.06] 那現在如果說。[657.06-659.06] 將來這個會持續發生的話。[659.06-661.06] 將來這個會持續發生的話。[661.06-663.06] 我們可能ABC就是接下來。[663.06-665.06] 我們在流感之後。[665.06-667.06] 我們就會再把快三再加進去。",
    "[667.06-669.06] 我們就會再把快三再加進去。[669.06-671.06] 就變成一個比較完整的產品。[671.06-673.06] ABC這樣子。[673.06-675.06] 那我們另外這個有一個肺炎感染證。[675.06-677.06] 那我們另外這個有一個肺炎感染證。[677.06-679.06] 就是幫客戶開發的。",
    "[679.06-681.06] 就是客戶他要做。[681.06-683.06] 也做出來他也取證了。[683.06-685.06] 可是那現在就是看他銷售的情況。[685.06-687.06] 可是那現在就是看他銷售的情況。[687.06-689.06] 有開始小量出貨啦。[689.06-691.06] 那量還不是很大。",
    "[691.06-693.06] 那再來是下面這些。[693.06-695.06] 可能就是病媒紋。[695.06-697.06] 傳染性疾病啊。[697.06-699.06] 還有動物這個像。[699.06-701.06] 叫青豬啊。[701.06-703.06] 就測那個豬的厭孕。",
    "[703.06-705.06] 羊的厭孕。[705.06-707.06] 那再來是毒品的檢測。[707.06-709.06] 那這個都是會用同樣一種。[709.06-711.06] 這個技術平臺。[711.06-713.06] 就快三的這個技術平臺。[713.06-715.06] 只是裏面的抗原抗體也是不一樣。",
    "[715.06-717.06] 那下來就是。[717.06-719.06] 其實大家比較care。[719.06-721.06] 是我們家用的CGM。[721.06-723.06] 比較在確認我們家用CGM是怎麼做出來。[723.06-725.06] 那我們現在。[725.06-727.06] 可能時間上還是會到。",
    "[727.06-729.06] 年底。[729.06-731.06] 今年年底看能不能比較明確。[731.06-733.06] 然後可以不可以送臨牀。[733.06-735.06] 那這些確定了。[735.06-737.06] 當然就是明年後年。[737.06-739.06] 看出來的時間。",
    "[739.06-741.06] 然後認證的時間。[741.06-743.06] 都可以開始出口。[745.06-747.06] 那這個。[747.06-749.06] 客字化的專案。[749.06-751.06] 這個就是。[751.06-753.06] 對我們公司從前面講到現在。",
    "[753.06-755.06] 就是我們在技術。[755.06-757.06] 我們現有的技術平臺就是。[757.06-759.06] 這個電話學光學。[759.06-761.06] 跟測流免疫分析。[761.06-763.06] 那當然後面還會有更多。[763.06-765.06] 其實還有一些其他的技術啊。",
    "[765.06-767.06] 我們可能沒寫出來。[767.06-769.06] 因爲我們的產品的開發還沒有完全出來。[769.06-771.06] 不明顯。[771.06-773.06] 那這個就是我們的技術平臺。[773.06-775.06] 那它會衍生出一些新產品。[775.06-777.06] 那當然我們就。",
    "[777.06-779.06] 持續去優化更多的產品出來。[779.06-781.06] 然後看客戶的需求。[781.06-783.06] 然後。[783.06-785.06] 再來做法規。[785.06-787.06] 像昨天前三天。[787.06-789.06] 我們就在做Ivdr的。",
    "[789.06-791.06] 臺灣的認證。[791.06-793.06] 那這個所謂的ivdr。[793.06-795.06] 對以前的ivdd完全。[795.06-797.06] 這個他們的法規內容。[797.06-799.06] 差異蠻大的。[799.06-801.06] 所以這邊我們就要去。",
    "[801.06-803.06] 適應這些法規的需求。[803.06-805.06] 然後。[805.06-807.06] 再來現在所有的產品。[807.06-809.06] 基本上所有的產品都。[809.06-811.06] 醫材或藥品。[811.06-813.06] 都要學的藥品也一定要做臨牀。",
    "[813.06-815.06] 以前ivdd都。[815.06-817.06] 不見得要做臨牀。[817.06-819.06] 現在基本上都需要。[819.06-821.06] 那再來就是。[821.06-823.06] 像這個4G 5G 8G。[823.06-825.06] 這種廣通的界面。",
    "[825.06-827.06] 現在。[827.06-829.06] 在歐盟來講。[829.06-831.06] 他們這個叫。[831.06-833.06] 它也有定出一些新法規的出來。[833.06-835.06] 所以我們現在說。[835.06-837.06] 這個。",
    "[837.06-839.06] 網通的產品。[839.06-841.06] 或界面。[841.06-843.06] 這個都要符合這個法規的需求。[843.06-845.06] 所以這個的要求。[845.06-847.06] 會越來越嚴謹。[847.06-849.06] 所以。",
    "[849.06-851.06] 這個也是要。[851.06-853.06] 然後也要做我們自己的app。[853.06-855.06] 上個禮拜他們也app出來。[855.06-857.06] 我們自己的app還不錯。[857.06-859.06] 那這個就是可以。[859.06-861.06] 方便我的客戶去使用。",
    "[861.06-863.06] 因爲我們本來想說。[863.06-865.06] 可以去結合別人的app。[865.06-867.06] 後來我們的客戶反應給我們是說。[867.06-869.06] 他不希望跟。[869.06-871.06] 其他的app。[871.06-873.06] 因爲有些app太fancy。",
    "[873.06-875.06] 那對他們來講太複雜。[875.06-877.06] 他們使用操作上面。[877.06-879.06] 其實沒有那麼多的必要性跟需要。[879.06-881.06] 所以後來我們現在。[881.06-883.06] 發展出來我們自己的app的時候。[883.06-885.06] 比較簡單。",
    "[885.06-887.06] 機器操作完了他自動就可以傳到我們手上。[887.06-889.06] 連我們自己的app。[889.06-891.06] 他自己就會有進入出來。[891.06-893.06] 所以這個。[893.06-895.06] 現在就是看後面的推廣。[895.06-897.06] 那我們是iOS跟Android的版本都有的。",
    "[897.06-899.06] 所以這邊就看。[899.06-901.06] 後續上架以後的。[901.06-903.06] 推廣的。[903.06-905.06] 情況。[905.06-907.06] 那。[907.06-909.06] 那再來就是。",
    "[909.06-911.06] 這個剛講的。[911.06-913.06] ICU的CGM。[913.06-915.06] 那現在就是真正都拿到。[915.06-917.06] 現在就是在等。[917.06-919.06] 這個取證。[919.06-921.06] 然後再來就是。",
    "這個有文章。剛剛有講過。那就是市場的銷售。部門的情況這個比重。今年EQ。美國看起來有比較高。",
    "歐盟比較少。亞洲也少。那亞洲就是。我要有一半。來自於大陸這邊的銷售。有下降那就是。",
    "跟大陸的經濟。經濟的狀況。是有關聯性的。那美國比較。成長是因爲。我們爲了關稅的問題。",
    "我們多進一點貨。客戶也有多進一點貨。主要是想。不知道關稅的最後的結果。會是什麼。所以大家都背了一些貨。",
    "那歐盟的話。其實歐洲比較少。主要是什麼。好像是我們那個。意大利的客戶的量。有點稍微。",
    "它有點停滯。反而是我奧地利的客戶的單子。應該增加了。所以這邊看起來是有稍微的少一點。那這是EQ。去年的整個。",
    "財務數字。其實。我發現。EQ表現算還可以。",
    "毛利。也有點低。比我想象中要29。那其實以機器跟飾片。這個比重。我後來自己去除出來。",
    "我感覺以這個產品。這個產量這個飾片跟機器的產出。其實今年EQ比重。是有點拉高一點。像24年就稍微低一點。也比23年。",
    "再高一點點。所以。其實今年到2Q。我感覺我們。我們的財務數字應該都會。來得錯。",
    "所以今年目標看能不能到。下半年再說。下半年再說。那這個就是。產品佔比。那這個可能要跟各位。",
    "說回一下。電極測試片。電極測試片。就是這個橘色這個6%。20266% 2025年的EQ。只有2%爲什麼呢。",
    "因爲它之前是。我們出一個。就是一大板給他們。然後他們自己去分裝。然後包裝完出貨。那現在它是。",
    "要我們幫它整個包裝。包裝成品出貨。其實對我們也是好事。因爲包裝成品代價比較高。可是一些。所以這個量。",
    "就像。這個量。就是這個量。這個量。從6%。就變成2%。",
    "反過來我這個雪囊這個比重。會增加。那非雪囊的。測試套腿。有點下滑。表現的不如。",
    "不如預期。可是現在看。我們美國的。有一些證拿到。看是非雪囊這邊的證。拿到以後。",
    "出貨量會不會再上來一點。那這個就看下半年的表現。這樣子。好。那這就是。第11屆的公司治理評鑑結果。",
    "這個上個月纔出來的。那我們表現還不錯。就是總分有上來。因爲去年是78分。那今年是88.4分。那排。",
    "集聚是。21到35%。可是如果說一層列表。那是一層列表。那市值會達50幣。會達50幣的公司來排。",
    "我們還更高。是2%到10%這個比重。我們非常努力在做EVSG。還有那個。資訊透明度那邊。表現。",
    "好。這就是我們的簡報。就那樣。接下來就直接去文維了。所以這個資訊。跟之前都差不多了。",
    "只是財務數字稍微做一些變化。那我也承認我們。我們有一些。產品客戶發展。那邊稍微慢了一點。關稅。",
    "我感覺目前看到的就是。10% 我們之前有出到美國去。那。美國子公司那邊說。關稅就是10%。就是現在最高就是10%。",
    "不然就是他整個關稅撤掉。0% 因爲這兩個。上個禮拜也是在扯。他說要撤銷他這個。對的關稅嘛。那就是回到0%。",
    "因爲之前我們的關稅都是0。那現在就是最高。現在是10%。不可能回到32%。30%都不太可能。所以還在看。",
    "那如果被撤銷對我們來講是比較好。其實他最後也是傷害了他自己美國。他美國。對我們來講。競爭。還是持續存在。",
    "關稅。就是最後有時候客戶會把。關稅推給我們。說要我們負擔。那我們就會跟他們。現在還是。",
    "談判。照理說。應該你們要。負一半還是你全付這些。那我們。付那個關稅纔對。",
    "不是我們自然。不然我降價降那麼多。你還要我再負擔。關稅。根本就賺不到錢了。``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```

    "First of all, I will check the transcription content provided and notice that each entry has timestamps and corresponding sentences. My task is to arrange these sentences in logical order to form naturally smooth paragraphs while maintaining the order and integrity of the original sentence. For example, users mention information such as time of establishment, listing situation, number of employees, etc., which may need to be grouped together. Next, I need to identify which sentences belong to the same topic or logical unit.",

For example, the user mentions that \"MD7 goods evidence is 20420246\" appeared twice, and needs to confirm whether it is repeated or required to merge. In addition, some sentences may have wrong timestamps, such as \"[48. 80-52. 18] was founded on December 20, 97,\" where the timestamp may have an interval between the previous sentence and need to check whether it belongs to the same paragraph.",

Product items, such as rapid screening reagents, blood glucose testing, etc., need to be grouped by function or customer feedback to ensure logical clarity. During the conversion process, pay special attention to the correctness of the timestamp and ensure that each sentence's position conforms to its time order. For example, the development of the flu rapid screening reagent should be arranged in chronological order from 2022 to 2024 to avoid confusion.",
