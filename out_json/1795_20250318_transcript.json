    "OK Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the Lotus Pharmaceuticals 2024 Ernst Co. This is Yoling from Corporate Communication of Lotus and thank you for joining us today. So on today's call, we are pleased to have our CEO Petah and our group CFO Beata here with us. They will provide insight into a strong result we have achieved in 2024 and share updates on the progress of our team initiatives. So we encourage you to submit any questions you may have through the online platform and anytime you read the code, then I will read your questions to management during the Q&A session. So now I'd like to turn the code over to Petah who will begin with an overview of the 2024. Petah, please. Thank you and good afternoon also from me. Good afternoon to all shareholders attending the meetings as well as everyone else interested in Lotus Pharmaceuticals. And special thanks to our hosts from Uanta for organizing the event. Agenda for today we have three sections in our presentation. I'll start first with the business highlights for last year obviously. And then we will go through the business highlights for the next year. And then we will continue with more in depth information on the financials for 2024. And then I will finish presentation with the business outlook for 2025. And this will be followed by Q&A section. So starting with the business highlights for 2024. I'm very happy to have the opportunity to report today that Lotus has delivered amazing in case. Amazing results for 2024. 2024 has been so far the best year in our history. So for the six consecutive year we have delivered double digit growth both on the top line as well as on the earnings. Last year in 2024 we reached out revenue of 18.6 billion US dollars which is representing 10% in real growth. And we have also achieved a lot of growth in the last year. And EPS of 19.35 which is representing 23% year on year growth. We have also finished year with significant amount of cash. 6 billion NT dollars and also a similar amount in committed borrowing capacity. The company is average less than 1.5 billion US dollars. And with a bit of margin of 40%-42% which is on the higher side for the industry compared to industry peers. This everything provides very strong foundation for future growth which I would like to highlight here will come not only organically through growing existing business as well as launching internally developed product but inorganically. And then in the next two years we will also be able to expand our business. So I would like to say thank you very much to all of you for your hard work. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. We have also achieved a lot of growth in the last eight years. Judging from the Sciences and Water Resources analysis, we achieved huge growth in both management and products. With a lot of entries into banking applications, vitamins and Kindle, d estrements, paddy synthesis, meters, the health connections, 戶面,。ugg, wokin, climates, compatibility, consumption statement, emeetry change, neurom筆,。我們的生意在2024年。亞洲生意成功。對不起。所以在2024年。",
    "我們的生意在亞洲成功。5%的年齡增長。年齡增長的最大貢獻者。是時間市場。當然是由於Taba的購買。我們在2024年中。",
    "成立了生意購買。我們從1月1日開始。成立了生意購買。我們從1月1日開始。成立了生意購買。我們從5月份成立了Taba。",
    "這是一個領域成功的生意。我們目前看到的。從我們從事生意購買到。是超過我們的期望。也超過了生意購買。我們已經承諾了。",
    "這件事。是由Lotus的管理人員執行。執行的。在韓國我們也看到了。非常好的成果。特別是從我們的主要品牌。",
    "比如Cusimia。Mercellon Vivista 這些都增加了我們的期望。這些都增加了我們的期望。臺灣我們也看到了。非常好的成果。從主要品牌的產品。",
    "也有很強的出口。從臺灣的品牌的原子設施。也有很強的出口。所以整體上。臺灣的生意進步非常好。我們在臺灣的整體上。",
    "開發了66個SQ。這當然是爲了。未來的增長。在全球市場上。",
    "韓國、臺灣以及南亞的 export business 是我們的最強增長輪廓，在2024年成爲了15%的年年增長，主要的貢獻者當然是在美國。當然是在美國，是Lanardomide，Lanardomide的下降是Buprenorphine和Naroxone，我們在前面的會議中通過了這些消息，我們沒有預期Buprenorphine和Naroxone的下降，尤其是在德爾明斯，因爲它是一個相當高價品，所以Lanardomide有很大的銷售和增長的銷售，當然是在高價的Buprenorphine和Naroxone的下降。在2024年在 export markets，我們在2021年總共發佈了21個SQ，當然是在美國市場外，也在增長的預期上有所增長，所以我們在2024年從2024年到2020年都看到了在2024年我們看到了增長，我們在2024年到2028年都看到了增長，所以我們在2028年進行了，2028年我們進行了，我們將在2028年進行了，我們將在2028年進行了，。アズセディノーロン 和パールズ・ żyćlyp  變成了二年，2014年，我想再度出色 puville系列的一個產品，我們所發行的幾項的進步，我們已經通過了一份研究，這是一款545bit的產品，目標市場是美國和全球，我將在下方的視頻中更多介紹，除此之外，我們還將終於發佈了Vocalsporin，這是一種有可能的第一次發佈機會，這是一款某個產品，這款產品在2月2025年發佈，除此之外，我們已經發布了10個新項目，大多數是在護理學上，但我們還發布了3個新項目，一種是在醫療科學上，繼續來看我們的項目，我們在2024年完成的重要的項目是，在印度發佈了印度協會的新政策，除了臺灣，爲什麼印度？這是一個很明顯的答案，印度是世界上最好的醫藥業，特別是在醫療發展和醫療發展上，我們需要的就是以印度的更多的集中注重，以我們的興趣進入更多的細節產品，在豐富發展、醫療發展、醫療發展、醫療發展、挑戰IP的方面，我們確實發現我們需要更多的技能，更多的資源的資源，因此我們決定了在印度發展中開發這個設計中心，它位於海德爾巴特，這個位置被認爲是印度的最佳設計中心，它是在某個地方，在18個國家中，有超過200家公司的家庭，有些是國際的，例如，有多國的，例如，有多國的，例如，有多國的，我們的設計中心有約20,00平米，在15個地區的地區中心，完全融合在一起，在科技業業業中，有些最可靠的名字，所以我確實相信以這一步進行的，我們將獲得更好的效率，更成功的設計，將獲得更好的效率，因爲我們將復興豪運，因爲我們將獲得豪運，因爲我們將復興歷史上的貢獻，因爲我們將獲得貢獻，因此，我們將資源在印度，因此，我們將資源在印度，因此，我們將資源在印度，因此，我們將資源在印度，再次預示下條 Κ，那麼在公司的進程期間，我們已經完成了20個合作，再次，我們的商業是在南部的臺灣，也有轉移到臺灣，還有，我們在亞洲的AlphaTro獲得了貨物，我們之前也談過，AlphaTro是我們最受認可的商品，我們在亞洲的商品公司中，也有成功獲得了Sanofi的商品，您所知，我們在去年簽署了商業，我們在今年早上結束了商業，所以，從Lotus的角度來說，我們的商品已經開始推出了，這就是一項變化的商業，對於南部和整個南東亞洲的商業，除此之外，我想提出三個我們成功簽署的商業，我們是在2023年成功簽署的商業，這三個商業是一系列的，是一個專業傳播的，LP797是第一個專業傳播的，它是一系列的，它是一系列的，是一個專業傳播的，LP797是第一個專業傳播的，它是一系列的，它是一系列的，是一個專業傳播的，。LP786，這是一種以ER-2- 肺癌的護理治療，類似於前一期的產品，有可能發生第一次發動，有機會發動，還有NC-1發動，預測指數的銷售率，預測指數的銷售率，預測指數的銷售率，將達到全球1.6億美元，第三個產品是，從豐富的方式來說，是IGA的第一種護理治療，是IGA的第一種護理治療，是IGA的第一種護理治療，非常具有特別的發展技術，非常具有特別的發展技術，以及辨認的公式，也有非常強大的可能性，不僅於美國，也在其他市場中，例如在亞洲，美國的大型護理品，預測是將達到800億美元，我認爲這種構圖的注重，非常重要，我們的目的就是與公司合作，有了不同的技術和機會，或機會使用智能的方式，例如發展非侵蝕性氧化碳水化合成物，這些方法讓我們能夠獲得機會，並且不限制我們的排行圖選擇，只能夠進行在家的產品選擇，我確實確定，未來會有更多這樣的產品進行進行進行進行。",
    "那麼，我們現在進行的更新，包括設定和設定的設定，以及設定，以及設定，我們將在歐洲的PALBOTC-CLIP 和ASCIDIN-ORAL，以及PALBOTC-CLIP 都會進行設定，所以，這些設定是非常重要的。**注意：**

    "<think> 好的，我現在需要處理用戶提供的逐字稿片段，將其轉換爲段落式逐字稿。首先，我要仔細閱讀用戶的要求，確保完全理解任務。用戶強調不能刪除、改寫或濃縮任何一句原文內容，所以必須保持原話的完整性。接下來，我會逐句分析提供的逐字稿。注意到每個句子都有時間戳，例如[898.82-901.82]，這可能表示該句在錄音中的起止時間。用戶希望將這些按時間順序排列的句子重新組織成自然的段落，但必須保留所有內容，不進行任何刪減或修改。",
    "首先，我需要識別哪些句子在邏輯上屬於同一段落。例如，關於歐洲和美國的設定部分可能屬於同一段落，接着是關於批准的部分，然後是關於維持業務的關係等。需要確保每個段落內的句子連貫，同時保持原句的順序和內容。在處理過程中，可能會遇到重複或冗餘的句子，例如“在美國、新西蘭、墨西哥、新西蘭和澳大利亞進行設定。”和“以及在澳大利亞進行設定。”這裏需要確認是否屬於同一段落，可能需要合併或調整結構，但必須保留所有內容。",
    "另外，注意一些可能的拼寫或語法錯誤，例如“氧化銀酸膠膠膠”可能重複了“膠”字，但用戶要求不進行修改，所以必須保留原樣。同樣，“聯合聯合公司”這樣的重複也需要保留。在組織段落時，需要確保每個段落有明確的主題，例如批准情況、業務關係、聯合公司合作、貨幣執行等。每個主題下的句子應按邏輯順序排列，可能需要根據時間戳或上下文進行調整，但必須保持原句的順序。還需要注意時間戳的連續性，確保段落內的句子按時間順序排列，但用戶可能更關注內容的連貫性而非時間戳。因此，可能需要根據內容邏輯來分段，而不是嚴格按時間戳。",
    "最後，檢查是否有遺漏的句子，確保所有提供的句子都被正確歸類到相應的段落中。完成初稿後，再通讀一遍，確認沒有遺漏或錯誤，所有內容都準確無誤地保留，並且段落之間過渡自然。</think> 以下是整理後的段落式逐字稿（完整保留所有原句，僅調整標點與段落結構）：。--- 我們還將在歐洲的Bozutinib, Aphatinib 和Quadribil 進行設定, 以及Ninternib 和Sovgel 在美國、新西蘭、墨西哥、新西蘭和澳大利亞進行設定。以及在澳大利亞進行設定。所以，這些設定非常重要, 並且實際上是我們的承諾, 將高品質的產品帶給免費的醫生。",
    "我們現在也有接受英國的氧化銀酸膠膠膠批准批准的批准, 也有在美國和美國的幾個美國國家。我們也有批准了在英國、新西蘭、以色列和歐洲市場的氧化銀酸膠膠膠批准, 這些批准在2025年根據Python的批准下, 當然是在歐洲市場上的批准上的推廣。另外，我們的主要產品, 在在5年內的Ninternib上進行了5年的批准, 我們在加拿大、英國、基本上所有歐洲的氧化銀酸膠膠批准中, 也在美國和美國的氧化銀酸膠批准中, 也在美國和歐洲市場中進行了批准。我繼續進行更多的更新。關於維持維持業務的關係, 我們已經舉行了許多重要的聘請和維持業務的公司。我認爲這當然是在我們的增長策略上的一面, 我們所目前所獲得的, 我們將來獲得的, 但我們仍然沒有實現我們的維持業務的目的。",
    "因此，我們已經舉行了維持業務的公司, 爲了在亞洲進行我們的業務行動。我認爲, 以我們的聘請和聘請人的意義來說, 我們對亞洲市場的行動有非常強大的控制, 而且我們也認爲我們的聘請人是有很大的機會, 也有機會將現有的產品使用成長, 以及將新產品的生產量提高。同樣的, 我們也決定了聘請聯合聯合公司的聯合聯合公司, 爲了幫助聯合公司在產品市場的發展、質量和購買性的發展, 並且幫助聯合公司的購買性。這些都是在任何藥物公司的價值鏈上的重要聯合公司的聯合公司的重要聯合公司。就像我們的聯合公司的聯合公司的聯合公司, 我們也領導了一個非常強大的聯合公司的聯合公司, 他背後有很強大的聯合公司的聯合公司的細節記錄。我確實確定, 這將幫助我們不僅是在提高聯合公司的聯合公司的貨幣, 也提高我們的聯合公司的聯合公司的貨幣。",
    "最後, 我們也領導了聯合公司的總理。這是一個重要的聯合公司的聯合公司的重要聯合公司。我們相信, 在很多方面, 這就是我們對聯合公司的成長和成長的一部分。尤其是現在, 我們正在進行的聯合公司的貨幣。因此, 我們希望在聯合公司的聯合公司的貨幣上, 我們將有更多的信心, 我們將有更多的信心, 我們將有更多的信心, 能夠在聯合公司的貨幣上決定對自己的決定, 不僅是在聯合公司的貨幣上, 也在BD上。我們在聯合公司的貨幣上投入了百多億, 所以我想確保我們在決定對自己的決定中再次提高聯合公司的投資。",
    "在貨幣上, 我們的貨幣執行實在是很好的一年。我們有很多聯合公司的貨幣檢查, GMP檢查, 很多的生產商, 以及我們在印度的CRO, 這些檢查結果是很好的。包括美國FDA, 還有韓國公司, 臺灣公司, 阿爾維薩公司, 這些都是巴西公司。我們的貨幣執行實在是很好的一年。我們的能力和質量都很高。這些都是我們的重要的成功因素。",
    "我還想提醒大家, 我們在前一段時間完成了Cialis的設計。我們本來是在短時間內轉賬到臺灣的Cialis公司。我們也在發佈更多的經濟API。我們在做這些, 我們成功了大規模的增長, 並且我們的生產成本也增長了。最後, 我們也成功了5.2億美元的成本, 並且我們的貨幣成本也超過了24億美元。我們也做了很大的進步在生產性方面, 我們的MCCI ACG率是從B3B到A3, 這實際上是我們的執行執行計劃。",
    "關於業務認識, 我們是最好的公司3年之後的HRH爲我們的業務認識。我們也被獎勵爲WinkedIn的多元傳媒冠軍, 以及爲臺灣的2024年傳媒冠軍的傳媒冠軍的和安茲烏特曼的水晶膠。這些獎勵的顯示我們的...。--- （注：原文最後\"這些獎勵的顯示我們的...\"爲不完整句子，已按原文保留）",
    "and that financing cost decreased about eleven percent from five hundred and twenty six million in twenty twenty three to four hundred and sixty nine million in twenty four, primarily due to higher interest income from a significantly larger cash position. So other gains increased about eleven percent driven by investment income as well as favorable foreign exchange movements between the US dollars and the Hellene's dollars. And the company's effective tax rate remains stable at around twenty percent. So overall, that earnings grew twenty three percent to approximately five billion dollars, translating to an EPS of nineteen point thirty five. And the board has recommended a cash dividend of five point seventy three per share, up from the four point sixty six per share last year. Representing a year year increase of twenty three percent on cash dividend. And the total dividend payout is estimated to be approximately one point five billion dollars, or about thirty percent of last year's net profit. And the remainder will be retained to fund future positions, expanding our global footprints, investing facilities and R and D, and of course, reserved for the future. So that's the those that is all aligned with our consistent dividend policy of the past few years. And the average yield of the proposed dividend is one point. Sorry, two point one two percent comparing with one point sixty five percent last year. We'll be on to the next slide. So now let's take a closer look. At our revenue and twenty twenty four. So in Asia, our business grew by about five percent overhaul. Korea added about one hundred and sixty four million in revenue, reflecting approximately three percent growth. Key brands in Korean marketplace show very strong momentum, and with QC mere growing almost thirty seven percent year over year, and mercy loan up forty two percent and a VC growth of forty two percent. So we're looking at a three percent growth. And a Vista, which is also process friends rising about twenty five percent. However, this was partially offset by lower revenue for commodity generics, as well as income from the royalties and licensing. So as well, the depreciation of Korean won against Taiwan dollars had the fact of muting the growth in terms of reported currency, which is Taiwanese dollars. So, in Taiwan, our domestic business grew about four percent, reaching approximately two point five billion in twenty twenty four. About sixty eight percent of Taiwan's revenue now came from brand products such as CLS, Cluster, Linta and so on, while the generics made about the remaining one third of for the revenue. Our brand portfolio grow approximately zero point three percent, and the main reason was the price. Erosion on Linta offsetting growth in other segments, including the growth in a cluster of process and the Zip, Zelka, which is the new generation of new chemical entity in a small cell lung cancer. And our Southeast Asian cluster delivered approximately one billion in revenue in twenty twenty four, increased from only two hundred and seventy nine percent. And the total revenue of our cluster was approximately two point two billion in twenty twenty four, supported by contributions from our future brand and the full year of combined high operations. So, we are now looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. We are also looking at the growth of our cluster. So,our export businesses grow by about fifteen percent, with the US adding nearly a billion of revenue, and the rest of the world outside of the US contributing additional two hundred and forty five million in revenue.",
    "In the light of my revenue grew almost two billion, almost sixty percent year and year. While generic suboxone declined by one billion Taiwanese dollars, or about thirty percent, due to intensified competition. Outside the US, growth was driven by demand of our lead amyloid in Europe and in Latin America, and very strong performance of binarbin soft gel, and as well as a launch in early markets of the generic, and as well as a launch in early markets of the generic, which is a prostate cancer treatment. So, next slide. You can see our revenue sources remain very diverse and balanced. In twenty twenty four, forty eight percent of our revenue came from export outside of Asia, while fifty two percent came from our Asian home markets. The US continues to be our largest single market, contributing about forty two percent of our growth. Our growth revenue, and followed by Korea and Taiwan. Oncology remain our cornerstone, and accounting for nearly half of our total revenue. While CNS, Premium Care, Lifestyle each contributed about twenty percent. Now, I think it's time to give an update on the performance of our obesity market in Korea, which is a very important obesity market globally after the US. Our flagship product, Qsymia, maintains its very strong market position, despite the launch of Novo Nordic's next generation obesity treatment, WeGovie, that was launched in Q3 last year. As we expected, WeGovie largely, we are the largest, we cannibalize the sales of Novo Nordic's early product, which is also a GLP-1 treatment called Succenda, while the prescriptions for Qsymia remain relatively stable. The significant lower cost compared to GLP-1 therapies has been a key differentiator, particularly for a treatment like obesity, which requires continue monthly dosing. And this trend in Korea also mirrors our partners' experience in the US, where Qsymia has successfully competed with the larger and broader range of GLP-1 options. And now, finally, let's talk a little bit about cash and debt. In 2024, the company generated a total of $1.5 billion in cash. The company's net cash from operations before paying taxes and interests. The net cash from operations after the payments of tax and interest came to approximately $6.2 billion, which is a $4.5 billion increase from prior year. And we closed the year with a robust cash position of almost $6 billion. The company's net cash from operations after the payments of tax and interest came to approximately $7.4 billion, which is very much consistent with that of 2023.

I think we think we're talking about this on one of our previous meetings is that we want to have a southeast asia similar to the level of the Korean Taiwan together and we have done it already milestones we have achieved a significant milestones in two thousand twenty four what we promise they are alpha choice and there is more to come that we think we are on a very good track there is so course that there will be more on the creation portfolio positions in licensing of course and i'm not saying that there is no way to know M&a more parallel to know M&a rather than buying just a local company why we say we say we're saying I'm saying I'm speaking about China",
    "<think> Ok, now I need to deal with user-provided verbatim fragments and convert them to paragraph verbatim. First, I want to read the user's request carefully to ensure that the task is fully understood. The user emphasizes that the original text cannot be deleted, rewritten, or condensed, so it must be kept as it is, just adjust the format. Next, I need to check the verbatim content provided. There seems to be a lot of timestamps and corresponding sentences, some are English, some are Chinese, and some may be garbledging due to technical issues such as \"disrupt so by the\" and \"we interf mal\" sections.",
    "First of all, I will look at the sentences corresponding to each timestamp and then group them according to the context to form a coherent paragraph. It should be noted that some sentences may fall into the same paragraph, such as a continuous English sentence may belong to the same person's speaking, while the Chinese part may fall into another part. At the same time, the duplicated \"a lot of\" may need to remain the same, even if it looks duplicated and cannot be deleted. During processing, I will encounter some challenges, such as whether the interval between timestamps means that the person is speaking or whether it is just a pause of the same person. For example, from \"so there's nobody effectively\" to \"so we tried in the last few years with several products on\", because they are all about the company's discussion.",
    "In addition, you need to pay attention to the garbled in the Chinese section, such as \"disrupt so by the\" and \"we interf mal\", which may need to be kept as it is, but users may want to keep the original format, so you can copy it directly. At the same time, the duplicated \"a lot of\" appears multiple times, and may need to check whether it belongs to the same person's stress, but all duplicates must be kept. During the processing process, I will ensure that each sentence is arranged in chronological order and that the line breaks apart between paragraphs, but sentences within the same paragraph remain consistent. For example, the English section may be divided into several paragraphs, discussing market strategies, growth goals and payment solutions, while the Chinese section may involve different topics such as M&A projects and payment plans.",
