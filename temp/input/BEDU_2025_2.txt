Robert Niu : Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are pleased to report that Bright Scholar delivered solid Q2 quarterly results, demonstrating our resilience in an evolving external environment. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress executing our dual-engine growth strategy. Under this plan's dedicated initiative, we expanded our Schools business and advanced our global recruitment efforts for international students. As a result, our Schools business remained consistent with the total enrollment holding steady year-over-year at 2,699 students as of March 31, 2025. Moreover, we also received strong 14.2% year-over-year improvement in revenue per enrollment at our U.S. schools in this fiscal quarter. Meanwhile, our global recruitment initiatives maintained strong momentum across existing markets, building a sustainable pipeline for expansion. As a leader in premier international education, we remain committed to delivering exceptional learning experience while enhancing operational efficiency and growing our global footprint to drive sustainable long-term value. Importantly, we've made significant strides in optimizing operations, achieving year-over-year reductions in SG&A expenses. With our established global network and the ecosystem, we are well-positioned to accelerate revenue growth and create lasting value for both customers and shareholders over the long-term. The Schools business remained our primary revenue source this quarter, accounting for around 61% of our total revenue. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, including the impact of VAT policies in the UK, stable student enrollment year-over-year demonstrates the resilience of our diversified portfolio by optimizing operational efficiency and maintaining rigorous academic standards with mitigated external pressures while continuing to deliver high quality education. During the quarter, our U.S. schools set new benchmarks for excellence by delivering outstanding results across both academic and extracurricular domains. On the academic front, our CATS Academy Boston students have already secured over 100 acceptance from top tier universities around -- across the U.S, Canada, and the UK, with more expected as the admission cycle continues through May 2025. This early success underscores the strength of our college prep programs beyond academics. We are equally proud of our students' remarkable achievements in athletics. I'm also delighted to share our own CATS Boston student athlete, Jaylen Harrell, was named as the Gatorade, Massachusetts Boys Basketball Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. This honor has previously been awarded to legends like LeBron James and Jason Tatum, and recognize Jaylen's unparalleled talents, academic dedication and community leadership. Back-to-back wins are exceptionally rare to maintain CATS Boston as a hub for nurturing future champions. Furthermore, our CATS Boston Academy has been ranked number five nationally in the 2024 to 2025 prep programs ranking by NEPrepBasketball.net, further validating our leadership in combining elite athletic programs with world class education. Together, these achievements underscore the significant progress we've made in our U.S. Schools business this quarter and how we are fulfilling our mission to develop well-rounded global citizens. In the UK, our schools have delivered exceptional university placement results that solidify Bright Scholar's reputation as a premier pathway to global higher education. Across our UK boarding schools, students have received offers from 8 of the top 10 UK universities according to QS 2025 ranking. Including prestigious institutions like Cambridge, UCL, and Imperial College London, a significant cohort of our students has also earned offers from top 100 global universities with applications extending across Europe, Asia, and the United States. What makes these results particularly remarkable are the perfect records we have achieved at specific schools. At the Michaels, we maintained a flawless 100% Cambridge acceptance rate this year with all tree interviewed students securing admission invitation. Similarly, CATS Cambridge has now achieved 100% Russell Group University offers for its A-level students for two consecutive years, marking an exceptional -- marking an extraordinary accomplishment that puts our students in the company of the UK's academic elite. These outstanding outcomes not only demonstrate our consistent ability to prepare students for the world's most competitive universities, but also validates our position as a truly global education provider capable of opening doors to top institutions across continents. In addition, our global recruitment efforts gained further traction across key markets, enhancing our pipeline for future growth. Early indicators show strong demand for our programs, particularly in markets valuing our Western curricula and university pathways. We're also leveraging our partnership with local institutions to amplify our presence, ensuring sustainable growth in new geographies. Looking ahead, Bright Scholar remains focused on executing our dual-engine growth strategy to drive excellence in our Schools business while expanding our global footprint in recruitment to serve more students planning to study abroad. Our strong academic results, coupled with operational resilience, position us to capitalize on the growing demand for premier international education. We are confident in our ability to deliver stronger value -- stronger long-term value to students, families and shareholders alike. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Ms. Cindy Zhang, who will discuss our key financial results. Please go ahead, Cindy.
