[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Jonathan Nieves, the private investor.

Jonathan, your line is live.Unidenified Analyst: Good morning, everybody.My question is why did research development increase by 64% in the 2025 first quarter, will R&D remain at this high level for the 2025 year?Or will it vary?Qizhou Wu: [interpreted] In the first quarter, we did increase our R&D effort and hence, the R&D expenses also went up, mainly in the area of our research and development of our EPS product.For this product, we have been staffing to help us to further advance the technologies.

We also increased some of the equipment design modules.So all that contributed to higher R&D expenses in Q1.On a full year basis, looking forward, we were seeing about 5% of our total revenue, give or take around $34 million on R&D.So this also -- please be mindful, we are -- we are maintaining 5% of revenue in R&D.That will help us to qualify high-tech status in China.And then we will also, in turn, receive tax benefit.

Operator: And our next question is coming from Gary Nash from NASH Consulting.Gary, your line is live.Gary Nash: Thank you.

First, good day to everyone.Two-part question.Could you please comment on the almost $1 million increase in inventories in the first quarter of 2025.And then if you could also comment on what is the outlook for inventory levels and the rest of 2025?Qizhou Wu: Okay.Thank you. [interpreted] So Gary, to answer your question.

The inventory increase -- it's actually partly related to the trade war and as U.S. administration has been putting a lot of pressure on the tariff.So in response to the potential pressure, we have made some advanced shipments to the U.S. a month ahead.So we -- so our customers will not experience any disruption in the production for that consideration.So -- we -- our inventory in the U.S. has given us up to September in case any kind of productivity policy wise.So this is -- it's sort of out of ordinary practice, but we have to do something to address such potential risk.That's why our inventory increased.

But in terms of percentage inventory increased about 10% for overall revenue, we have increased in 19.9%.So it's not completely outsized increase.And on a full year basis, we believe we will maintain a healthy level.We will now have an oversized -- the oversized inventory.Operator: Okay.So that answer your question, Gary?

Gary Nash: Yes, it does.Qizhou Wu: Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Michael Fiedler, Private Investor, your line is live.Unidenified Analyst: Good morning.My question is the gross margin was 17.1% for the first quarter of 2025.What is the outlook for the gross margin for the rest of 2025?

Jie Li: [interpreted] Okay.Yes, Q1, our margin at higher than 17%.That's the Q1 gross margin it's very simpler to comparable corresponding quarter to 2024 as well as a full year average gross margin.And we are -- we are fully aware this level of gross margin is typically, it's lower than our typical margin in the past prior to 2024, but this is our -- part of our strategy to proactively seeking more market share by the strategy, our pricing strategy.Clearly, this strategy has bear fruit -- this strategy has bear fruit.So we are growing revenue, gaining market share.

On a full year basis, 2025 full year basis, we believe we will maintain a similar gross margin level and with a slight improvement. strategy has bear Operator: Okay.We appear to have no further questions in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Okay.I'll hand back over Kevin then for further comments.Kevin Theiss: Well, we have some additional questions that were e-mailed to us.So I'll go ahead and ask those.So the first one is, what is the impact of the U.S. proposed tariffs under your new order flow.

And are -- is it impact in any areas beyond North America?Qizhou Wu: [interpreted] Okay.So in terms of tariffs, we mentioned earlier in the beginning of the year, we had anticipated there will be some pressure coming from the administration.So we -- made a decision to make some advanced shipment to our U.S. facility.And to -- those inventories have points to carry us to foreseeable challenges in the coming quarters, which cannot be useful.And also, as yesterday, in China, U.S. announced the choice on the trading on the tariff, which is a very positive development, and we have immediately got in touch with our customer in North America, and we come to a very good conversation and position and they have agreed to bear increased part of the cost related with the tariff.

So to answer your question, overall, the tariff has very minimum impact to our business and the order flow.The new order continues to develop the product towards our customers.And outside the U.S., we still see some opportunities as we reported today, we have a pretty healthy strong growth in Brazil.So we are also making some strategic planning now on global expansion.And that will also, at some point, when we announce it will help us to further whether different kind of months in the marketplace.Kevin Theiss: Okay.

Thank you.I have another question that was e-mailed in.Please provide an update on the manufacturing of the REPS steering product for NeginkoLeco?And have other automotive OEMs also ordered the REPS product.Qizhou Wu: [interpreted] Yes.REPS is a growth area.

We have already begun our RETS production.In addition to that, the other OEMs also placing orders on our new products.They are including Cherry Auto, Guangzhou, Guangxi Auto, Yitong Bus, and Qingdao.And for this new RETS product, we have also built a brand new facility dedicated to the production and install new production lines.And so we are pretty excited about this new opportunity presented to us.Kevin Theiss: Thank you.

And the last question is, can you provide an update on the Sentient operation as far as the automatic driving systems?Qizhou Wu: [interpreted] Yes.Okay.Thank you.Yes.We have quite a bit of development on Sentient AB, our subsidiary for developing autonomous driving technologies.

Our Sentient's main customer now is Volvo Truck for the EPS product.We are shipping 3,500 units.And this month, on a four-year basis, we are targeting 40,000 units for 2025.On the revenue side, Sentient, for this particular customer, we're poking EUR 30 million for 2035.Other than this particular customer, we have one contract with BYB, their new model, Model Song, S-O-N-G.We are expecting mass production for this particular model autonomous driving technology for 2025.

So the mass production will start in 2025.And also, we have entered into Volvo passenger vehicle with our fly-by-wire technology.And there's another automaker, Renault.So we are making very good progress with all different customers on both passenger and commercial side.So we are expecting a very meaningful contribution from our subsidiary, Sentient.Thank you.

Operator: Just before we wrap up the call, I'm going to check to see if there are any further questions from the audience. [Operator Instructions] Okay.We have no one else in the queue at the moment.I'll now hand back over to Kevin for any closing remarks.Kevin Theiss: Well, we want to thank everyone for your participation in today's conference call.Please be safe.And we look forward to speaking with you in the future.
