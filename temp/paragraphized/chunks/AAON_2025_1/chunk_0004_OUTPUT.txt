Matt Tobolski: Thank you, Rebecca.Starting on Slide 10.Gary and Rebecca covered this pretty well, but here, you will see how AAON‑branded sales performed relative to BASX‑branded sales.Total revenue growth of 22.9% was fully driven by BASX‑branded equipment sales growing 374.8%.This is driven by data center demand for both airside cooling equipment manufactured at the BASX segment and liquid cooling equipment manufactured in the newly expanded space at the AAON Coil Products segment.BASX segment sales were up 138.9% and AAON Coil Products sales were up 287.8%.

This helped drive an expansion in segment gross margin of 350 basis points to 24% at BASX and 100 basis points to 34.6% at AAON Coil Products.At both segments, we also began to benefit from the initiatives we're taking to improve operational efficiencies, particularly at the BASX segment where we're rightsizing capacity at the Oregon facility and focusing more on productivity of the facility.We expect to see more improvement at the BASX segment throughout the year, especially in the second half of the year.AAON‑branded sales were down 19.1%, driven by rooftop production volumes being down at the AAON Oklahoma segment.AAON Oklahoma segment sales were down 23%.This was largely reflective of the weak bookings we realized throughout most of the fourth quarter.

Supply chain issues with components associated with the new refrigerant also contributed to lower production volumes.This was a temporary issue related to refrigerant transition that is a challenging to manage occurrence and difficult to anticipate.As the market transitioned to production of the new refrigerant equipment, component manufacturers were challenged with keeping up with demand.In hindsight, we would have increased inventory levels for some of these components, but it was tough to predict at the time.As a result, the lack of access to certain parts caused us to maintain lower production levels despite a large backlog of bookings.The positive is, that we're beginning to see improvement in the supply chain, which is allowing us to increase production rates in the second quarter.

Given the size of the backlog, we anticipate production will continue to increase over the next several months.Now, please turn to Slide 11.Total backlog at the end of the first quarter finished at a record level of $1 billion and up year‑over‑year 83.9%, and up quarter‑over‑quarter 18.4%.Backlog of AAON‑branded equipment was $404 million, up year‑over‑year 44.9% and up quarter‑over‑quarter 23.4%.This backlog was the highest level since the first quarter of 2023.Since the beginning of the year, bookings at this side of the business have been strong.

We received a lot of positive commentary from our sales channel, and we believe our competitiveness with the new refrigerant equipment has never been better.We're still trying to get an idea on exactly where our price premium lies, but it seems that we have narrowed a little.Also helping drive the backlog, we continue to realize strong demand of our heat pump configured rooftop units, otherwise known as Alpha Class.In April, we started to introduce our next generation of the Alpha Class series, which is operable down to negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit.By the end of this year, our entire product portfolio of rooftop units will be configurable with this low‑temperature configurability, meeting the DOE's commercial heat pump challenge two years in advance of the set 2027 goal.The strong backlog on this side of the business positions us well entering the second quarter.

Our goal is to drive a lot more volume through the Tulsa facility.And as we do this, you'll see margins at the AAON Oklahoma segment begin to recover.With the supply chain issues abating and given the size of the backlog, we should begin to see production and profitability improve in the second quarter and continue through the third quarter.The fourth quarter will depend on the bookings we receive over the next few months.The macroeconomic environment remains in pretty poor shape, which is creating a lot of uncertainty on the back half of the year.For now, though, we are taking market share.

Despite the macro uncertainties, the sentiment across our sales channel is relatively upbeat.We are making headway with our national account strategy and are optimistic we will see meaningful impact, especially with our industry‑leading Alpha Class air source heat pumps.These national accounts are large in volume and are multiyear replacement programs. And if we're successful, it will be material to growth.Backlog for BASX‑branded equipment was $623 million, up year‑over‑year 122.7%, and up quarter‑over‑quarter 15.4%.Bookings of both airside and liquid cooling equipment for data centers have been strong year‑to‑date.This puts us in a great position for the rest of the year and provide much more visibility and certainty of sustainable growth into 2026.

With such a large backlog in hand, we can manage production more efficiently, which you will see in the margins of the AAON Coil products and BASX segments.We continue to anticipate margin improvement, most notably in the BASX segment as we progress throughout the year, particularly in the second half.Our capacity expansion plans continue to progress well.

Production of our liquid cooling data center equipment at the AAON Coil Products segment has been ramping well.In the new space, we currently have three production lines in place with plans to increase that to five later this year.At BASX, we are making great progress with rightsizing capacity.We've already begun to see these operational improvements in the margin, and you should expect to see more improvement in the second half of the year.The expansion in Memphis is also progressing.We've started to assemble equipment there at a small scale.

Now, it won't be as efficient as our other facilities until we get the vertically integrated production set up, but it is helping us achieve our on‑time delivery commitments and goals.We expect meaningful production to begin in the fourth quarter of this year with a sharper ramp‑up of volumes throughout 2026.Until we get this production in place, we continue to expect the facility will incur about $5 million to $7 million of costs with minimal revenue to offset.In the first quarter, these costs amounted to approximately $2.8 million.

In addition, we realized a $2.7 million fee associated with various incentives relating to Memphis.Now, please turn to Slide 12.We maintain our full year outlook.We anticipate full year sales growth to be in the mid‑ to high‑teens at a gross margin similar to what we realized in 2024.SG&A as a percent of sales will realize a decline of 25 to 50 basis points, and CapEx will be approximately $220 million.For the second quarter, we look for sales and earnings to be up modestly from the first quarter.

Note that the tax rate was unusually low in Q1, and that our interest expense in Q2 will be up with the higher debt balance.The implication is that operating income will be up quarter‑over‑quarter more than just modestly as indicated in the earnings guide.Finally, inclusive of the updated annual outlook is our tariff mitigation surcharge of 6%, which recently went into effect.The outlook assumes this surcharge will be in effect throughout the remainder of the year.Of course, trade policy is very fluid.At any moment, depending on how policy evolves, we could increase or decrease the surcharge.

We anticipate the surcharge will fully neutralize the impact of tariffs on our costs and margin.Lastly, I would like to highlight that we are hosting an Investor Day on June 10 in New York City.Please find additional information on our corporate website under the Investors section.I hope to see some of you there.Now with that, I will hand the call back to Gary for closing remarks.
