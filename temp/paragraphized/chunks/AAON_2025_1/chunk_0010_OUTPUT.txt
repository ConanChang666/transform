下列是已經處理的「段落式逐字稿」：。Brent Thielman: Really helpful, Matt. And then maybe as a follow-on, sort of beyond the issues associated with the refrigerant change and those associated components, can you talk about maybe broader exposure just now with the implementation of tariffs and what that might do to the kind of broader supply chain?How you think AAON is positioned around that, where you feel like you're well positioned or not, just for the things that we can't potentially see coming in terms of broader impacts to the supply chain?Matt Tobolski: Yeah, certainly. I mean tariffs definitely – we had a bet going Brent, how long it was going to take for a tariff question to come. So, it came a little later than we expected on the overall Q&A. But when we think about the impact of tariffs within the AAON segment, I'll say one thing that we feel good about is we have a tremendous amount of vertical integration in our manufacturing process. And we also rely heavily and proudly rely heavily on a lot of our U.S. partners. So, the exposure to tariffs that we see from an AAON perspective are certainly less than what we see in some of our competition. So, to start off, we say that certainly, we see ourselves being better positioned in a tariff-ridden environment. Now, we'd be naive to not say they're going to impact us somehow. I mean supply chain, even for U.S. manufactured components that we might buy, a lot of components that go into those components might be sourced internationally. And so there's definitely some tariff impact. And obviously, that's reflected in our surcharge. But the general supply chain environment that we have, there'll be some noise that we think will come out of the tariffs. But by and large, the focus on U.S. manufacturing, the focus on vertical integration and really a pretty strong U.S.-based supply chain that we rely on for the vast majority of our components puts us in a position where we think those are going to be a smaller impact to AAON, especially relative to a lot of our competition. Brent Thielman: Okay. Just last one, just on the basics branded products. Maybe more of a clarification, Matt, I think I heard you say, a lot of growth certainly aligned with one of the customers out there. Could you just talk about diversification of customers within that product line?Do you expect more diversity in the coming year, especially as you're bringing on new capacity?Just trying to get a sense around how much is aligned with a single customer versus a lot of different customers that are out there. Matt Tobolski: Yeah. No, it's a great question, Brent. And I'll say that the math certainly is never in our favor when you get a $200 million order in terms of its impact on some concentration, at least in the near term. But what I would say is while that is a great win, and that's certainly something that is helping fuel a lot of the growth, it's also very front of mind for us to continue getting diversified customer base. And so, if you look at the activity that we have in terms of both bidding activity, in terms of some new orders that we have, large-scale orders, not small orders, there is a continuing diversification in that customer base. There's also an acceleration of new customer interactions. With the win of that liquid cooling product, we've got a tremendous amount of inertia in the industry regarding the solutions we can provide. And so, our sales and engineering teams are actively engaged with a large spread of new customers supporting both liquid cooling and traditional colocation data center projects. And that definitely, as we look forward, is going to be a continued focus to continue diversifying, continue building upon the great wins we have to be very intentional about continuing to build great wins with new customers as well. And so, going forward, I think you'll see our backlog continue diversifying in a customer base perspective and really not having us to over leverage on one single customer. Brent Thielman: Very good. Thank you. Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead. Tim Wojs: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Just wanted to echo the same sentiments to Gary. It's been great working with you. Gary Fields: Thank you. Tim Wojs: Maybe just — I just have a couple of follow-ups. So, I guess, on the Oklahoma business, has there been any change to how you're thinking about the full year revenue guidance?

I think previously, you had kind of said maybe the full year would be flat to down a little bit. Has that changed at all?Is it just kind of more back half weighted?And then, how do you think about kind of layering that surcharge part into that?
