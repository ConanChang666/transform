Gary Fields: Starting on Slide 3.Prior to jumping into the results, I want to start off by reminding you of our core strategic pillars.These pillars consist of leading in innovation and custom solutions, driving sustainable organic growth and being a best-in-class operator.These three pillars help guide our long-term strategic planning and remind us of what we are trying to accomplish when forming tactical strategies.All of these pillars did not always exist at AAON.Since our founding, leading in innovation has always been core to who AAON is.

Over the past several years, our strategy has built upon this with a focus on developing ways to drive sustainable long-term organic growth and being a best-in-class operator.All of the tactical initiatives that we've taken, such as transitioning to a leadership team, putting in place succession planning, formally constructing and documenting long-term strategy planning, adopting a One AAON principle, and I could go on and on.All of this was to better leverage our core to drive sustainable and efficient long-term growth.This company has never had a better long-term strategy with a better leadership team to execute it.What we're doing with the development of heat pumps on the AAON side of the business, and custom airside and liquid cooling data center solutions on the basics side is very exciting.The strategies we're taking regarding the other two pillars ensures that we will fully leverage these innovations, along with the already premier solutions we provide to drive market share gains at highly profitable levels.

Now turning to Slide 4.The first quarter was a solid quarter for AAON.Net sales, margin and earnings per share notably improved from the fourth quarter and backlog grew to a record level.Total net sales grew year-over-year 22.9%.Sales of BASX-branded equipment were up 374.8%.Both airside and liquid cooling solutions for data centers were driving factors.

Partially offsetting this strength, sales of AAON-branded equipment were down 19.1%.Production of our rooftop units was impacted by the weak bookings we received throughout most of the fourth quarter.Additionally, supply chain issues with certain components associated with the new R454B refrigerant were also a factor.On a positive note, bookings of this equipment year-to-date have been strong.We also have begun to see these supply chain issues abate early in the second quarter.Total gross margin contracted 840 basis points versus the comparable quarter a year ago.

This reflected weak production volume of AAON-branded rooftop units and the resulting operating deleverage effect.Gross margin at the AAON Oklahoma segment was down 1,380 basis points.Strong sales of BASX-branded equipment, along with operational efficiency improvements drove solid gross margin expansion at the AAON Coil Products and BASX segments.

Gross margin at these two segments were up year-over-year 100 and 350 basis points, respectively.Total backlog finished the quarter at a record level of $1 billion, up year-over-year 83.9%, and up quarter-over-quarter 18.4%.First quarter bookings of both AAON-branded and BASX-branded equipment were robust.Backlog of AAON-branded equipment was up quarter-over-quarter 23.4%, and this was the highest level since the first quarter of 2023.Bookings of rooftop units were very strong and strengthened throughout the quarter.Backlog of BASX-branded equipment was up quarter-over-quarter 15.4%, driven by bookings of both airside and liquid cooling data center equipment.

Given the backlog on both sides of the business, we're positioned well entering the second quarter.I will now hand it off to Rebecca Thompson, who will walk through the quarterly financials in more depth.
