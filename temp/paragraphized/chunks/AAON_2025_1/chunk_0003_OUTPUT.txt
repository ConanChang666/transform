Rebecca Thompson: Thank you, Gary.Please turn to Slide 5.Net sales for the quarter increased 22.9% to $322.1 million, up from $262.1 million in the first quarter of 2024.The year-over-year growth was driven by a 374.8% increase in BASX-branded equipment sales.This was reflected in the results of the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments.Net sales at these two segments were up 138.9% and 287.8%, respectively.

Sales of AAON-branded equipment declined year-over-year 19.1%.This was largely reflected by the AAON Oklahoma segment, which realized a decline in net sales of 23%.Production of rooftop units were impacted by weak bookings throughout most of the fourth quarter.This was related to a temporary lull in demand as the market shifted from the legacy R-410A refrigerant to the new R454B refrigerant equipment.Bookings have since rebounded in a strong manner, suggesting that we're becoming more competitive with the new refrigerant equipment.Also impacting the first quarter was a tight supply of certain components associated with the new refrigerants, which temporarily constricted our production rates.

Supply of these new components have recently begun to improve and will enable us to increase production rates significantly in the second quarter.Moving to Slide 6.Gross profit decreased 6.4% to $86.4 million from $92.2 million.As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 26.8% compared to 35.2% in the first quarter of 2024.Challenges from the industry regulated refrigerant transition and non-residential construction activity significantly affected our largest segment, AAON Oklahoma, resulting in decreased volumes and lower overhead absorption.

Gross margins at this segment were down year-over-year 1,380 basis points to 23.5%.As we begin to see production volumes increase in the second quarter, we fully expect gross margins to recover.Production volumes of BASX-branded equipment acted as a partial offset.This allowed gross margin at the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments to expand.Operational efficiency improvements at both our Oregon and Texas facilities also contributed to improved segment margins.Please turn to Slide 7.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.3% to $51.3 million from $45.3 million in the first quarter of 2024.As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 15.9% from 17.3%.Depreciation and amortization was up $3 million due to our increased investments in back-office technology, offset by a decrease in professional fees of $3.1 million due to various professional, regulatory and legal corporate requirements in 2024.SG&A expenses also included a $2.7 million fee due to our real estate broker associated with the December 2024 acquisition of our Memphis, Tennessee plant for a percentage of the incentives awarded to us by various entities.Moving to Slide 8.Diluted earnings per share was $0.35, down 23.9% from a year ago.

Excluding the net impact of the $2.7 million real estate broker fee, adjusted earnings were $0.37, down 20% from a year ago.The decline in earnings fully reflects the lower production volumes and profits of AAON-branded equipment.Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 9.8%.The company's estimated annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 25%.Turning to Slide 9.Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances totaled $2.4 million on March 31, 2025, and debt at the end of the quarter was $252.4 million.

Our leverage ratio was 0.95.Year-to-date, cash flow used in operations was $9.2 million compared to cash flows provided by operations of $92.4 million in the comparable period a year ago.Year-to-date, cash flow from operations largely reflected increased investments in working capital.Capital expenditures through the first quarter of the year, including expenditures related to software development, increased 30.2% to $50.4 million.We drew down $97.5 million on our revolving line of credit over this period, largely to finance the investments in working capital, capital expenditures and $30 million of open market stock buybacks.Overall, our financial position remains strong.

This gives us flexibility and allows us to continue to fully focus on investments that will drive growth and generate attractive returns.For 2025, we continue to anticipate capital expenditures will be $220 million.I will now turn the call over to Matt, who will walk through operations in more detail and update you on our outlook.
