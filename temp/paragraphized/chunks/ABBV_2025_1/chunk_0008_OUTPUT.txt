<think> Alright, I need to process this query carefully. The user wants me to convert a line-by-line transcript into paragraph form without cutting or summarizing anything. First, I'll read through the entire transcript to get a sense of the structure. The text includes multiple speakers: Jeff Stewart, Operator, Courtney Breen, Rob Michael, Jeff Stewart again, Operator again, and Mohit Bansal. Each speaker's statements are separated by line breaks. My task is to group these into coherent paragraphs, maintaining the exact content. I have to make sure that the transitions between speakers are clear and that the sentences flow naturally within each speaker's contribution. For example, when Jeff Stewart talks about BoNT/E, his paragraph should include all his lines in sequence. I should look for places where a new speaker starts and insert the speaker's name before grouping their consecutive lines. Also, I need to preserve any formatting like names and titles (e.g., "Operator", "Courtney Breen from Bernstein") correctly. I'll start by identifying the speakers and their respective lines. For instance, Jeff Stewart has two parts: one where he discusses BoNT/E and another where he talks about pricing. The Operator introduces different participants like Courtney Breen and Mohit Bansal. I need to ensure each speaker's lines are grouped properly and that names are placed correctly at the start of each paragraph. Another point is to maintain the exact wording from the original transcript without any alterations. Even if the sentences might be grammatically correct when grouped, my focus is on preserving the original content's integrity. I'll check for any markdown and remove it as per instructions. Let me proceed step by step. First, handle Jeff Stewart's initial input about BoNT/E. Then, move to the Operator's introduction of Courtney Breen. Courtney's question has two parts, so I'll group those sentences under her name. Rob Michael's response follows next. Jeff Stewart addresses the pricing strategy, and so on. The last speaker is Mohit Bansal with his question about Gubra. I'll reconstruct each speaker's section into a paragraph, ensuring smooth transitions and correct speaker attribution. After assembling the paragraphs, I'll review the entire text to ensure that no lines are missed or misplaced. Lastly, I'll check for any punctuation issues that might have arisen during the process, such as missing periods or incorrect capitalization. </think> 以下是依照您的要求處理的段落式逐字稿：。Jeff Stewart: Let me give a quick update on the BoNT/E and the combination approach in terms of how we're starting to think about it. Obviously, we're super pleased with the recent filing on BoNT/E. And as we've highlighted before, the short acting toxin will operate on two different levels for us. First, it will stimulate the funnel. It will basically be a market stimulator because we know there's lots of considerors in the marketplace that are just worried about going to a full strength toxin because it lasts for three to four months. So the approachability of a short acting toxin that works in about 8.5 hours and is gone in 2.5 weeks makes the market much more approachable for the people in the consideration phase. So we think it's going to work on the market and our share, because obviously we've done studies with BOTOX after BoNT/E. Now in the combination use, Carter, it's very interesting. This is more of a pure sort of share play. When we talk to the consumers, many of the consumers are using a lot of BOTOX and you start saying, can you imagine a BOTOX that works almost immediately, so an immediate acting BOTOX. That gives us the potential and we'll have to see how those trials and those studies play out to actually restate the whole market. Because what's remarkable about BoNT/E is that we can see a two grade change in the glabellar lines in 8.5 hours. So nothing has ever worked even close to that fast. So we could even have a premium toxin that sits alongside BOTOX one day or a replacement product for just simply a better BOTOX, an immediate acting BOTOX. So it gives us a lot of flexibility and it's certainly very exciting as Roopal has highlighted the program that will begin here for the combination. Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Courtney Breen: I wanted to look back to kind of part of the inventory and tariff conversation. We've been able to get some explicit answers from some of the peer companies. So just wanted to see if you were able to give us context as to whether you have enough inventory in the US to support products like Rinvoq, Botox, Vraylar or Humira for the rest of this year?And what about '26 and '27?And then the second question is just on the back of the BoNT/E question. Can you give us a little bit of context as to the pricing strategy for that kind of tester market?Because arguably kind of with a shorter directing time horizon, you have kind of less value. And so I'd love to see understand a little bit more about how you're thinking about placing these products together. Rob Michael: Thank you. This is Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second. Look, absent policy details, we're not going to get into speculating on the impact. I think you've known us to be a company that once we have a full understanding, we're very transparent and detailed. If you think about how we approach the Part D benefit redesign, as soon as we understood that impact, we were well in advance of the implementation of that discussing the impact on the company. But with tariffs, we don't have the policy details for the sectoral tariffs. So it's premature to speculate on the impact. And once we have that information, we'll communicate at the appropriate time. Jeff Stewart: And regarding the pricing, obviously, it's since we just had the filing, it's premature. We go through a very rigorous pricing analysis as we would get closer to launch. And some of the considerations that we would look for, which is, obviously, I mentioned, the rotation of even more patients into the aesthetic practices brings a lot of value to those practices. And if you think about it, the lifetime value of those new patients is very meaningful. So that could play into dynamics ultimately how we price the BoNT/E once we ultimately make that decision sometime next year. Obviously, it does work shorter. So that might imply a different or lower price point to start the trial. But those are all considerations commercially that we will go through as we go through our launch readiness process over the course of the year to really optimize the impact of that product as we bring it to the market. Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I would like to understand a little bit more about your thought process around Gubra?And there have been couple of strategies. So of course, Novo is trying to combine GLP-1, but then there is a strategy or thought process that amylin could be a good agent as a standalone agent. So how are you thinking about this, especially with the longer acting version?

Do you think there's a strategy to just use this as a single agent, especially among patients who cannot tolerate GLP-1?We'd love to get your thoughts there.
