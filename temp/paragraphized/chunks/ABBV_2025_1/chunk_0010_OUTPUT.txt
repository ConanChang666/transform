**Rob Michael:** And then Steve, this is Rob.I'll take your question on the manufacturing footprint.As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, obviously, AbbVie, we have a very broad footprint.An important part of the strategy is to assure supply.And as I mentioned earlier, we went through a global pandemic without any supply disruptions and that strategy certainly paid off.We also have, I'd say, a very robust manufacturing network in the US.

I think what's been widely misunderstood is Skyrizi as an example, our largest product is made in the US and so when we look at our global footprint, we consider assurance of supply.As Scott mentioned earlier, clearly, obviously, tax has an influence on longer term, how you'd want to structure your supply chain.So certainly, I think with a more competitive tax policy, that sort of provide the appropriate incentives.We try to say we have obviously been ramping our volume considerably.You look at just the performance, just then think about biologics capacity and just the tremendous ramps we've seen for Skyrizi and Rinvoq.And so we stay ahead of the curve.

We ensure that we are investing appropriately so we can keep up with that demand.I'd say the commercial team puts a lot of pressure on operations because they're performing so well, but operations stays ahead of the curve and invest appropriately.And so when we look at the investment, when I mentioned the greater than 10â€¯billion investment, that takes into account in the US, that takes into account our volume growth that we expect in addition to new areas that we will invest.For example, peptide manufacturing as an example, as we enter that space, obviously now as we enter into obesity, it makes sense to add that capability.And so that will also be part of our supply chain strategy here.So that's the way we're thinking about it. **Operator:** Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners.

Please go ahead. **Dave Risinger:** Thanks very much, and congrats on the performance.So I have two questions, please.And they're both a bit high level.So the first is the industry is facing three major US Government risks, actions that are harming biopharma innovation, including actions significant FDA disruption and questioning of proven medical science, tariff threats and also the Trump administration's agenda to take prices down more than the Biden administration took down drug prices.So considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington of the benefits that the biopharmaceutical industry brings to Americans, can you please comment on how your executive team and Board are engaging differently today with Washington leadership to change the political agenda for the better?And then second, the press release mentions that guidance doesn't reflect any trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs.

Can you describe the potential trade policy shifts that you're considering or thinking of beyond tariffs? **Rob Michael:** So we're obviously not a member of pharma today, AbbVie, but we do continue to communicate with the association really to seek alignment on the most critical issues for the industry.Now AbbVie has a large government affairs organization that engages with lawmakers and the administration on our top policy priorities.And that includes tax reform.We've talked about that quite a bit today IRA, 340B and patient affordability in Medicare.And we have actually seen some positive results from that engagement.I mean, just this week, Congress released a report on 340B, included a recommendation that changed the law to more clearly define a patient, which should help address the abuse that is occurring with this program.

I would also view the 340B policies in the latest executive order as a positive.I also previously mentioned that seeking to eliminate the pill penalty is a positive for innovation.So we will continue to work with lawmakers as we always have on policies that support a healthy US biopharma industry, continued innovation and patient affordability. **Roopal Thakkar:** Regarding FDA interactions, I would say our teams have been in active discussions with the FDA on multiple programs across therapeutic areas, sometimes daily interactions and no signals of a slowdown.We are monitoring the situation closely.However, thus far, we haven't experienced any delays to our timelines. **Scott Reents:** Just with respect to your question on my initial comments, it's just the trade policy shift we're talking about here is the potential pharmaceutical sector tariffs.It's not any additional things that we were contemplating.

Certainly, the environment has some uncertainty out there, but specific to that comment we were speaking of the pharmaceutical sector tariffs. **Operator:** Next we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.Please go ahead.
