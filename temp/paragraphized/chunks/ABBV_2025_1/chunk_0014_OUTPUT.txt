**Jeff Stewart:** So on PBM reform, I think we're supportive of anything that helps with patient affordability.And so to the extent that that improves the dynamic on patient affordability that that is truly realized in their pockets, that's favorable.So we are supportive of the efforts there.But it's really all about making sure that we're addressing patient affordability.As it relates to business development, we obviously really like the five key growth areas that we have today.As I mentioned, those will certainly drive very strong growth for at least the next eight years.

I think sometimes there's a misconception about neuroscience for AbbVie.It's more than just psychiatry.We have a very strong migraine franchise that is performing exceptionally well.In Parkinson's, we're seeing great results.And we've been in Parkinson's for a long time with Duopa.But as you think about the ramps we are seeing with BioLev, the innovation we've brought for those patients and then Tavapadon, came from Cerevel, we could really start to see our Parkinson's franchise emerge.

And so when I think about neuroscience, I would think about it really in four segments.There's psychiatry, it's an important segment.There's migraine, there's Parkinson's and there's all of the neurodegeneration.And we obviously are investing in Alzheimer's.And so you just look at the business development activity since the beginning of last year in neuroscience, extended our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar.We added a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh.

We acquired a next generation A beta antibody that's very promising for Alzheimer's from Aliada.And we're also investing in novel approaches for migraine disease.So we are actively investing in neuroscience.We obviously added obesity because we do think of ourselves as being a company that's going be very large in the next decade.So it doesn't hurt to have another source of growth.And we have evaluated various options beyond the five and we chose to move into obesity for a number of reasons.

It's obviously an extremely attractive market, has high prevalence and plenty of headroom for growth.It's a market that has ample space for multiple players and new entrants.And I think we're also uniquely positioned with our aesthetics business to access that channel in addition to therapeutics.And importantly, and it's something we always focus on is where are there high areas of unmet need.As we think about our portfolio, that's really our strategy is to drive a remarkable impact for our patients by elevating standard of care.When we look at obesity, there's plenty of opportunity, whether it's reducing GI side effects, improving body composition, more consistent weight loss across patient types, longer lasting weight loss.

And so as we evaluate that opportunity, we found the amylin class to be very attractive given it's the most validated non-GLP-1 mechanism for obesity and has very encouraging early data.And we believe the amylin opportunity with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset.So we will continue investing in obesity.We'll continue investing in our five key growth areas.And we think that gives us the right mix to drive growth for long term. **Operator:** Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Bank of America. **Tim Anderson:** I have a question on drug advertising.So AbbVie is the number one spender on this.

It's hard to turn on TV without seeing something like a ad.And that says you see a very positive ROI from that level of spending.As you know, there's some occasional talk by the administration about limiting such advertising.So my question is, do you think there's any basis in reality for that?I know you'll say it shouldn't happen, but that doesn't mean that it will potentially happen.But then on obesity, as you noted, your amylin is long acting.

Doesn't that imply that a really kind of key next part of the portfolio is a long acting GLP?Or are you not interested in the GLP-1 space at all?
