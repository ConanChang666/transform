Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob.I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.2 billion exceeding our expectations.Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing $5.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 65%.I'm especially encouraged with our portfolio performance across IBD, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to capture significant share given their efficacy, safety and dosing profiles.In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing roughly one out of every two in‑play patients in the US and total prescription share is now in the mid‑teens.Internationally, our Crohn's portfolio has achieved in‑play leadership in nearly a dozen key countries.

In ulcerative colitis, Skyrizi has already achieved the leading in‑play share in the US following the launch in the second half of last year.Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are now capturing one out of every three in‑play UC patients, a very strong leadership position for AbbVie.We are also seeing strong momentum across indications in dermatology and rheumatology as well.For Skyrizi, we continue to gain share in psoriatic disease, where we have achieved the leading in‑play share of new and switching patients in nearly 30 countries and see substantial room for total share growth.For Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing prescription demand globally across each of the room indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, the fastest growing immunology market, where we have two compelling head‑to‑head studies versus Dupixent.We are also preparing for the global launch of giant cell arteritis, another new source of growth for Rinvoq.

We received European approval earlier this month and expect FDA approval soon.The addition of this indication further rounds out Rinvoq's rheumatology label and gives patients with GCA access to a new compelling oral therapeutic option.Overall, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive results across all of their approved indications, and we will be raising our full year sales guidance for both products.Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 49.5% on an operational basis, below our expectations, primarily due to faster share erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression in the US.As a result, we will be lowering our full year sales guidance for US Humira.Moving to Oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion exceeding our expectations.

Imbruvica global sales were $738 million down 11.9%, reflecting competitive dynamics in CLL.Venclexta global revenues were $665 million up 12.3% on an operational basis.This strong performance reflects continued momentum in CLL as well as shared leadership in frontline AML among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.We also have an emerging commercial portfolio in solid tumors.This includes Elahere, our leading ADC for ovarian cancer with global sales of $179 million as well as Teliso‑V, a potential new medicine for late line non‑small cell lung cancer patients with US Regulatory approval and commercialization expected in the next couple of months.Teliso‑V will be supported by a dedicated sales force and medical affairs team, which will target academic and community cancer treatment centers to reinforce the importance of c‑Met as a biomarker and build relationships that support our emerging solid tumor franchise.

Turning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 10.2% on an operational basis.This was in line with our expectations.BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $556 million down 10.7% on an operational basis and Juvederm sales were $231 million down 20% on an operational basis.As we have seen over the last several quarters, economic headwinds have continued to impact market conditions.Based on the trends we are seeing, including a decline in recent consumer sentiment, we are moderating our assumptions for category growth globally and adjusting our full year sales guidance for aesthetics accordingly.While near term aesthetics market conditions remain challenging, the long term prospects for the category remain attractive, given high consumer interest and low penetration rates for facial injectables.

I'm particularly excited about BoNT/E, our fast acting, short duration toxin, which we recently submitted for US Regulatory review.This first in class toxin represents a distinctive innovation for the treatment of glabellar lines and has the potential to be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the facial aesthetics category.We anticipate commercialization next year.Moving now to neuroscience, where total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion up 17% on an operational basis, with all key products exceeding our expectations.VRAYLAR global sales were $765 million up 10.3%, reflecting share capture in both Bipolar I disorder and adjunctive major depression.We continue to get very positive feedback on VRAYLAR's profile in terms of dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to treat a full spectrum of symptoms. We are very competitively positioned with our migraine portfolio, where all three of our therapies continue to deliver double digit operational growth.

BOTOX Therapeutic global revenues were $866 million, up 17%.UBRELVY global sales were $240 million up 18%.And QLIPTA global revenues were $193 million, up 48.3%.And in Parkinson's disease, VYALEV global sales were $63 million reflecting continued strong uptake in Japan and Europe.We are also pleased with the early launch feedback in the US, where revenues are expected to ramp gradually over the next couple of quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination.Lastly, we are making excellent progress with the development of Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease.

This first in class D1D5 selective dopamine agonist has a favorable benefit risk profile and the potential to differentiate in several areas, such as sedation and impulse control.Tavapadon could potentially be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa for more advanced patients, which would be a complementary addition to our existing PD portfolio with VYALEV and DUOPA.We expect to submit Tavapadon for regulatory review later this year with commercialization expected in 2026.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the execution and strong momentum across our commercial portfolio.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.
