**Roopal Thakkar:** Hi, it's Roopal and I'll answer the 295 question regarding the multiple ascending dose study.Currently, what the data you've seen were at 1 mg and 2 mg and we have the opportunity here in this study to go several fold higher than the 2 milligrams. And we also have the opportunity to go beyond six weeks, namely around 12 weeks before we get into formal Phase 2b, which I would say around next year, we would go quite a bit longer.The sample size, what you've seen here maybe a little bit larger because of the multiple ascending dose format here.We'll see larger sample sizes once we get into the formal Phase 2b.The other opportunities here are also to look at titration at the 1 milligram or maybe even lower.We don't see any adverse events beyond suppression of appetite.

So there's an opportunity to be able to start low and start titrating up to doses quite a bit higher than 2 milligrams, but we're open to watch this study and be flexible.The other important findings would be around muscle and bone.So those would be other things that will be evaluated as well as looking at dosing.The half-life is around 270 hours.So that could give us an opportunity to go twice a month and even potentially monthly.So all that will be captured in this data set.

We expect to see some data next year and then that will allow us to best design a more formal Phase 2b study. **Operator:** We'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Cantor.Please go ahead. **Carter Gould:** Good morning.Thanks for taking the question.Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion around drug pricing kind of resurfacing and some rumblings around most favored nation kind of bubbling back to the surface.Wanted to get a sense understanding of your expectations and flexibility, if need be to take actions outside the US?And then maybe more of a commercial question, as we think about the potential co administration of BoNT/E and BOTOX, can you kind of help frame how you think that would impact the market?

Is this something that could just grow the overall pie, move share, etc.?Any thoughts on that front would be appreciated. **Rob Michael:** Thank you.Hey, Carter, it's Rob.I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second question.I think as we've studied the environment, I mean, we are very supportive of a balanced approach that addresses affordability while also encouraging innovation.And you've seen many of our peers reinforcing the importance for the EU to properly value innovation, which we echo and would support any policies that encourage that outcome.

That said, we hope the administration contemplates the harm that international reference pricing could have on US healthcare industry and future innovation.I think anything like price controls, cost increases or higher taxes just leaves less investment available across the industry to advance new innovative medicines.That said, I'm very encouraged by the administration's willingness to address the pill penalty in the IRA and is fixing that would support long term innovation in our industry.And so as we look at the push, I think, for the EU to more properly value the innovation is an absolute appropriate push.We're encouraged by some of the policies that really support innovation.And Scott also talked about tax reform.

And I think that's an important lever as well as we think about what are the things that will drive investment in the US and drive more innovation.And I think if you just look at AbbVie as an example, we've invested over $5 billion of capital since tax reform in 2017.I mean that includes a new oncology research center in South San Francisco that includes Skyrizi manufacturing capabilities in the US, eye care capacity expansion in Waco, Texas and technology infrastructure upgrades across our footprint, just to name a few.And importantly, as Scott mentioned, tax reform allowed us to acquire Allergan, an Irish domiciled company that we then redomiciled into the US.I mean that transaction enabled AbbVie to continue increasing our R&D investment through the Humira LOE, which is unprecedented.That will ultimately help us really lead to more innovation in our pipeline and ultimately impact patients of the future.

So when we think about policy, we think tax reform has provided the right incentives to invest more in the US and more in innovation.And that's what we would encourage.
