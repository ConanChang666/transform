Roopal Thakkar: You.Mohit, it's Roopal.I'll take that.So thanks for highlighting some of the potential here.And I think we're thinking about it quite broadly.So as you stated, there's an opportunity here as a monotherapy.

I think the way we think about it is tolerability is key.We see a number of dropouts, upwards of 30% even after a month of starting with the current set of assets.And then when we look over the course of the year, 60% to 70% of the patients will drop.Now there's a variety of factors that drive that discontinuation, but a key component is tolerability.So to have a monotherapy that's tolerable, that provides meaningful weight loss and potentially has other potential benefits.We've seen pre clinically preservation of muscle.

We'll have to see if that plays out.But that could be another benefit in the long term.When this launches, we do anticipate many of the patients will have already been on assays that are available today.So it could serve as a nice follow on for folks that couldn't tolerate or came off for other reasons and want to go somewhere else.Now in terms of combinations, recall, when we did this deal, one thing we liked about it, was also the neutral pH of the formulation.So that could enable combinations with a variety of mechanisms. And as Rob stated, we continue to be interested in this space and we'll be, thinking about other potential opportunities, which could include combinations that may drive further weight loss.

But key for us would be tolerability and durability of use.Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen.Please go ahead.Steve Scala: First of all, Bristol appears to think there's a path forward with co-benefit in adjuvant schizophrenia based on existing data.Where does AbbVie stand in its analysis of the future of emraclidine?For instance, has a path forward become more clear in the last few months?

Secondly, I believe AbbVie has more plants in Ireland than any other company.Curious how you think about that as well as your overall OUS footprint.Do you cut back OUS to invest in the US?Or do you maintain the presence OUS, given the fact that in four years we could have a different administration with very different views?And related to this topic, yesterday, Roche said that their US plants are 50% utilized.I'm wondering if AbbVie would share a similar percentage.

Roopal Thakkar: I'll start with schizophrenia question.In terms of the recent data, it's difficult for us to comment.I think that will be a discussion between the company and health authorities regarding the utility of a failed study.That would be their discussion to have.How we look at emraclidine is that we do still see potential and we want to approach this in a stepwise manner.The first step would be to look to see if we can further dose escalate beyond what was previously studied.

We saw variable PK levels in those patients from the pivotal studies, some were low and we think there's an opportunity to raise that.So a multiple ascending dose study will be initiated this year and that would apply to potentially monotherapy in schizophrenia as well as the adjunctive setting.So as that data rolls out and if we're able to utilize a higher dose, then we would again stepwise go forward into a Phase 2 setting to further derisk and apply our learnings in terms of trial design.And then if we see strong data there, which could be as a monotherapy, could be as an adjunct and also in neurodegeneration psychosis, then we would move into the Phase 3 setting.But I would say we still believe there's opportunity here.
