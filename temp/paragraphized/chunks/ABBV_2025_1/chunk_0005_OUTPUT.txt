以下是重新組織的段落式逐字稿：。Operator: For our first question, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on the results. Chris Schott: Just two for me. Maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, obviously some big step up in the guidance here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on which of the indications are most attributable to the upside we're seeing right now?And maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, maybe particularly Tremfya more broadly launching in IBD and how you're thinking about that dynamic?And then just my second question was on second immunology on Humira. Can you talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the tail for Humira in light of some of the erosion that you're seeing this year?Scott Reents: Chris, this is Scott. I'll start with kind of where we saw the increase attribute to for the various indications and I'll turn to Jeff for your other questions. So we raised Skyrizi by $600 million to $16.5 billion and that split between $200 million in psoriatic and $400 million in IBD indications. And then with respect to Rinvoq, we raised that $300 million and that's across all of the approved indications. So you can attribute that to $100 million for rheumatology, $100 million for derm and the remaining $100 million for IBD. Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's Jeff. And maybe I'll give some sense. We're obviously very, very pleased with the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in immunology as you've seen from the report. Maybe to give some perspective, it's not uncommon to start to see in class competition. We've seen that in psoriasis. We've seen that across the board. And maybe I'll just give a little bit of perspective over sort of the historical dynamics that we've seen with the IL-23 category. So for example, if you go back to like 2018, 2019 when the IL-23s were starting to come in psoriasis, the total patient share at that time in the early days was about 7% of the IL-23 class. Now it's over 60%. And if we look at where IBD is, obviously, we launched first with Skyrizi and Crohn's and everything's recently launching here in UC, it's about 7% of the total patient share in IBD. So you can imagine as we start to watch what this category is going to mean to transform IBD, we remain very confident. It's not a zero sum game. We feel very confident in our profile and what we're able to deliver if we look across UC, if we look across our head to head data versus sequence versus the other trials. And so net net, we see very, very strong momentum across the board, regardless of competitors that may come in. And then my thoughts on the Humira tail. Again, as I highlighted and Scott highlighted in his remarks, we are seeing a bit of faster erosions as the biosimilar start to play out. And this is, of course, the third year of the biosimilar event. So it's really not too surprising. We also do continue to see the molecule continue to erode. So as we look and we don't have full visibility and we'll be monitoring the 26 access as we go throughout the year. We do expect it to step down again. Just makes sense. That will be the fourth full year. So we'll have deeper visibility of that tail sometime over the course of the year. But as we said before, the real impact of the tail is when Humira does not have a meaningful headwind to our overall growth as a corporation. So we expect that to start to develop over that ’26 time period. Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter. And maybe two questions for me as well. You alluded to some of the mitigation strategies you're taking with respect to tariffs potentially. Could you just elaborate a little bit more there in terms of what that means for maybe inventory and then any contemplation on any changes to IP domiciling?And the second question I had is on the amylin program there. I know you talked a little bit about next steps, but was just wondering if you can elaborate in terms of how much higher you're going on doses, what you'd expect that to translate to in efficacy and maybe the size of those cohorts, like how many more patients will we get in this next update?
