**Rob Michael:** This is Rob.So Scott and I will handle your first question and Roopal will handle your second question.So just to, I think, back up and maybe talk about AbbVie's manufacturing network and then I can mention how we're thinking about potential mitigation.I think it's important to know that we have a broad footprint that allows us to assure supply for our patients around the world.And that's really why you've been able to see us avoid supply disruptions during events like the COVID pandemic.I mean and today, we have a robust US manufacturing network with more than 6,000 American workers across 11 sites.

As I mentioned in my remarks, that includes manufacturing of API, biologics, toxins and small molecules.For example, our largest product Skyrizi is made in the US for the domestic market.And given our expected volume growth and our expansion into areas like obesity, as I mentioned, we'll continue increasing our US footprint with over $10 billion in planned capital investment during the next decade.In terms of potential mitigation, in the near term, we could take inventory management actions or secure alternate sources of API.We could also look at cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives as a source of mitigation, which we always do.I think what's more challenging is trying to pass the tariff impacts to our customers, especially with penalties in the government channel and with existing contracts in the commercial setting.

So I don't see that as a viable source for mitigation.Longer term, we will add more US manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned capital investment of over $10 billion.So specific to 2025, we would look to mitigate the impact as much as possible with a combination of supply chain actions, cost efficiencies and any additional overperformance from our growth platform.But in the meantime, we have enough confidence in the momentum of our business to raise our guidance this year, which should be viewed as a positive. **Scott Reents:** David, with respect to IP, IP has been looked at, I think, when people try to assess the impact of potential tariffs on our sector.IP has been looked at as kind of a proxy as to what that impact might be.And certainly directionally, think that is something that would be somewhat telling.

That said, when we look at our profile overall, Rob mentioned the strong US presence that we have, but we don't see our profile suggesting any sort of outsized impact for us as a company.The tax rate is something that you can look at, which is essentially when you think of the bookends of the minimum tax for earnings outside the US for tax earned in or income earned in the US that really kind of aligns with where that IP is structured.And that blending of your income kind of produces generally directionally your tax rate.You see us being relatively in line with our peers.And so that suggests that we have a similar IP profile from an overall perspective.I'd also just quickly point out that sometimes with Allergan, as that was a company that we redomiciled back to the US, it was a foreign headquarter company.

Recall that Allergan was a series of several companies that were put together over a few years.And those companies all have a significant US presence as well.So Allergan's profile is not dissimilar from ours as a whole either.So I think when you think about that IP profile, it's important from a tariff perspective.It's also very important from a tax reform perspective.There was a lot of progress made in leveling the playing field for US companies in 2017 tax reform that did a lot of good things and really helped invest in the US as well as can create a competitive environment for our companies.

We see it as an important piece of building upon that tax reform to encourage further and long term, as I mentioned in my remarks, sustainable investment.So I see a tax reform initiative building on 2017 coupled with tariffs as something that will encourage US manufacturing over the long term, we feel very good about our profile right now.
