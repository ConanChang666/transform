My second question would be, what's the impact of lower oil and other input prices on the cost side?Could you speak to when, some of that could flow through and if not, the second quarter, could we ultimately see some benefit in the third quarter that might not be reflected in your current guide?」 Molly Beerman 回應說，「So as we look at our raw material cost in the second quarter, we are seeing caustic price increasing. We have about a $5 million negative. We didn't call that out in the guidance because we have productivity initiatives to offset it. And likewise, on the smelting side, we have price pressure primarily in Coke. That's about another $5 million, but the same we didn't call that out because we expect to overcome that with productivity.」 Nick Giles 說，「Got it. Thanks very much. Continue best of luck. Thank you.」 接著，Operator說，「The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.」 Carlos De Alba 問道，「Thank you very much. Just on working capital only, obviously, we're expecting all the consensus out ourselves an increase in working capital in the quarter, but it was a little bit more than expected. How do you see that playing out in the remaining quarters?」 Molly Beerman 回應，「Hi, Carlos. We will see working capital come down significantly throughout the year as we typically do. We do expect a pretty sizable drop-off in the second quarter just coming off some of the high pricing. As we looked at the timing of shipments as well as some of the build-up in raw material prices and volumes we did hit a higher working capital level in the first quarter than we had expected.」 Carlos De Alba 問，「Fair enough. And then in your guidance, I just want to confirm that so you're expecting the second quarter to have a tax benefit between $50 million and $60 million. So this is for to say that it's because the expectation is to have negative profit in the quarter.」 Molly Beerman 解釋，「It's not negative profit, Carlos. It's the remember, we calculate our taxes always on a year-to-date basis. And so we earned quite a bit in the first quarter. And as you look at declining alumina prices, then we have to do a catch-up entry for taxes to the first quarter. So it's really the catch-up entry that creates us into a net benefit position.」 William Oplinger 補充，「Alright. Great. Thank you very much. Is that clear to you, Carlos?Because that's a tough concept. You forecast out for the year when you close your books, at the end of March what your taxes will be. And you book the taxes accordingly. Essentially, what we're saying is that profitability will be, at least with our current view, will be lower in the second quarter because of pricing coming down. And we will be booking a tax benefit associated with our full tax year tax guidance. So it's not that we're projecting a, you know, don't think that hey. They're projecting tax income because they're gonna have an EBITDA loss. That's not the case. You project out the full year taxes and adjust it each quarter. And just I don't want you to walk away thinking, wow. These guys are gonna be projecting negative PBT. In the second pre-tax profit. In the second quarter because of the tax guidance that we're providing.」 Molly Beerman 再次說，「Yep. That's exactly correct. Thank you, Barb. You can be my using layman's terms?

I'm sorry. But it's complex stuff. And the tone of the question was, man, you're gonna have big losses. No. That's not. It's just the catch-up. If you look at the two details, we will actually have regular tax expense related to earnings in the second quarter. But we will have a catch-up entry that will trigger a benefit related to the first quarter.」 William Oplinger 接著說，「Yep. Great. Thank you. There's mud, but I'm sure, Louis can clear everything up for everyone.」 Operator 提醒，「The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.」 Daniel Major 問，「Hi. Yes, thanks. Can you hear me okay?」 Molly Beerman 回應，「Yes. I do.」 Daniel Major 再問，「Great. Yeah. Thanks. Just follow-up on just clarify the sensitivities around the tariff. So I think you've clarified before that the tariff is based on the LME plus the duty unpaid premium that's about $300, I believe, at the moment. So the 25% tariff, like, if that was applied to that, would it be right that that would be about $975 million against the current Midwest of about $850. So is it the right assumption that if things normalize the premium list by around $100, all else equal, that would be broadly neutral to the business relative to the $100 million guided you've given based on the $0.39. Is that the right way of thinking about those sensitivities?」
