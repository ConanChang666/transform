**William Oplinger:** We're not completely following the logic.And what I would suggest to you is you take that logic offline with Louis later, and he can answer it.What we can say is that the Midwest hasn't reacted as it's back to Timna's question.The Midwest has not reacted as high as what we would have anticipated based on a 25% 232 tariff.And the reasons for that are the two that Molly listed.One, there's still uncertainty around the tariffs, and I think the market is baked in uncertainty around the tariffs given some of the swings that we've seen.

And then secondly, there was some importation of aluminum in advance of the tariffs that will need to burn through in the United States until you see that margin a the marginal ton to come to the United States. **Daniel Major:** Okay.Thanks for that.And then the second question on, San Ciprian, that's following up from Chris's question, but think previously, you'd indicated that one of the requirements to put more cash into the complex was the release of the restricted cash.I think that still sits about $88 million.Can you give us an update on when you expect that to be yeah, to be released and how that will be kind of distributed, but that go into funding cash burn beyond 2025 or will it move back onto Alcoa's balance sheet and into the sort of net debt bridge? **Molly Beerman:** We have had success having a portion of it released.So the money that was related to the restart there's about $12 million that's been released and we continue to have discussions with the workers' representatives on getting the balance released.

There's about $75 million more there. **Daniel Major:** And do you have an expected timing on the release of that $75 million? **Molly Beerman:** Those discussions continue.We expect that we will guess recoveries related to the restart costs.Those will come in as we spend.We'll get those pieces released.But the part that is held related to the anode bake furnace build, that's a CapEx project that we are not going to do during this recovery period.That's about $50 million and that is the contentious point in the discussion. **William Oplinger:** We are not planning on rebuilding the big furnace through 2027.

So the thinking is that that would be held up that cash. **Daniel Major:** Okay.And then just final follow-up, if I could, on the guidance you gave on the cash burn for San Ciprian $90 million to $110 million.Is that for the smelter just the smelter and not the refinery? **Molly Beerman:** Just the smelter. **Daniel Major:** And I would assume the refinery is burning cash at $350 aluminum as well. **Molly Beerman:** Yeah.The refinery has been near breakeven through the first quarter as well, but it will move into a loss position with the lower API. **Daniel Major:** Okay.Thanks for the questions. **Operator:** The next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.Please go ahead. **Katja Jancic:** Hi.

Thank you for taking my questions.Maybe going back to the Midwest Premium, and I apologize if I missed that.But what was the higher Midwest premium assumed in the net $100 million calculation?Of the tariff impact. **Molly Beerman:** Katja, we were comparing the thirty-one Midwest premium.We kind of consider that the base before tariffs.Of $0.24 and then comparing it to the Midwest premium earlier this week at $0.39.

So that's the comparison. **William Oplinger:** So the $100 million is based on a $0.39 Midwest premium. **Katja Jancic:** And Bill, you mentioned the Midwest Freight didn't react as expected based on the 25% tariffs.What would be the right Midwest premium with the tariffs? **William Oplinger:** I had it in my slides presentation, so you're gonna ask me to go back to that.It was They $880 to $990.Thank you, Molly.You know my numbers better than I do. $880.It's on page seventeen of the slide presentation. $880 to $990.

And that's what we would think the equilibrium would be at a 25%, Midwest premium.I'm sorry, 25% there. **Katja Jancic:** Thanks.And then maybe lastly, just on the permitting in Western Australia.Is that still progressing as expected? **William Oplinger:** It is.We have a public comment period coming up here towards the beginning of the second quarter, so it is progressing as expected. **Katja Jancic:** Okay.Thank you. **Operator:** The next question is a follow-up from Nick Giles with B.

Riley Securities.Please go ahead. **Nick Giles:** Thank you very much for taking my follow-up.Iceland's prime minister made some comments around concerns that shipments from Iceland to the EU could be subject to trade restrictions.Whether or not that's drills, just wondering if you could comment on how Alcoa could be impacted by any trade action in the EU and maybe separately how Alcoa your desire to participate in the EU's you know, effort to ultimately reshore capacity?Thank you very much.
