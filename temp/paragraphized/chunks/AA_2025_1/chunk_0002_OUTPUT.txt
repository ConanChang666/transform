<think> Okay, let's see. The user has provided a transcript from Molly Beerman, and they want me to convert the "逐句切開的逐字稿" into a paragraph-style transcript without deleting or altering any content. The key points are to ensure that all original sentences are included and structured into coherent paragraphs.。First, I need to figure out how the original sentences are divided. The example shows that each spoken sentence by Molly is a separate line. So I need to group these lines into logical paragraphs based on the flow of the speech. Starting with the first speaker, Molly Beerman, she thanks Bill. Then she goes into discussing revenue, segments like Alumina and Aluminum, net income, adjusted EBITDA, key drivers, cash flow activities, capital allocation, and the outlook. Each of these topics would probably form a separate paragraph. I need to identify transitions between topics. For example, the shift from discussing revenue to segments, then net income, then EBITDA drivers, cash flow, capital allocation, and the outlook. Each of these sections should be a paragraph. Also, within the same topic, consecutive sentences from the same speaker should be grouped. I have to be careful not to lose any individual sentence. Since the user emphasized not deleting or editing, I must ensure that every line from the original is present and correctly ordered. Also, the output should be in Chinese, but the content is in English. Wait, no—the user's instruction is to take the English transcript and format it into paragraph style. The user's query is in Chinese, but the answer needs to be in the same language as the input. Wait, looking back, the user provided an English transcript and wants the response in Chinese, but the example response is in English. Wait, actually, the user's instruction is in Chinese, but the content is in English. The user might want the response in English, but the instruction is to write a "段落式逐字稿" which is Chinese for paragraph-style transcript. But since the input is in English, maybe the output should be in English, just formatted into paragraphs.。Wait, no, the user provided an English transcript and wants the output in paragraph form. The example provided by the user (in the problem description) shows the input as fragmented lines and the output as a coherent paragraph. The user's instruction is in Chinese, but the content is in English, so the output should be in English, formatted into paragraphs without changing the content. So my task is to take the original English transcript, which is line by line, and group them into paragraphs where each topic is a paragraph. For example, all sentences about revenue and segments can be in one paragraph, then net income, then EBITDA, etc. I need to make sure that each paragraph is a coherent section discussing a single topic, using proper sentence transitions and grouping related statements. Also, the user emphasized not deleting any sentence. So even if some sentences are part of a list or a series, they should stay as they are. For instance, when Molly Beerman lists the factors affecting revenue, each line must remain but arranged into a paragraph. Another thing to watch for is the speaker's name: "Molly Beerman: ..." This should be included once at the beginning of the paragraph if all the content in the paragraph is from the same speaker. Since the entire transcript is from Molly Beerman, she is the only speaker mentioned. Wait, checking the input, the transcript starts with "Molly Beerman: Thank you, Bill..." and continues from her. So the entire transcript is from her. Therefore, the speaker's name is mentioned once at the beginning of the first paragraph. I'll start by putting "Molly Beerman:" at the beginning of the first paragraph and then structure the rest into paragraphs accordingly. Each paragraph should cover a distinct topic or subtopic. For example: 1. Introduction and revenue performance. 2. Alumina segment performance. 3. Aluminum segment performance. 4. Net income and earnings per share. 5. Adjusted net income and EBITDA increase. 6. Key drivers of EBITDA. 7. Lower volume and other costs. 8. Aluminum segment EBITDA issues. 9. Impact of tariffs. 10. Corporate costs and intersegment elimination. 11. Cash flow in Q1. 12. Working capital changes. 13. Deleveraging efforts. 14. Other financial metrics. 15. Capital allocation framework. 16. Targeted adjusted net debt. 17. Flexibility with credit ratings. 18. Capital allocation priorities. 19. Outlook for depreciation. 20. Q2 Alumina outlook. 21. Q2 Aluminum outlook and tariff impacts. 22. Cost savings in Aluminum. 23. EBITDA sensitivity and tax benefits. 24. Midwest premium updates. 25. Quarterly tariff cost baseline. 26. Closing remarks turning to Bill. By organizing the sentences into these logical sections, the paragraph-style transcript becomes more readable while preserving all original content. I need to ensure that transitions between sentences are smooth but also that no information is lost or altered. Also, check for any numerical data or financial terms that need to be clearly presented. Since the user is a professional transcription editor, accuracy and proper formatting are crucial. </think> Molly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 3% sequentially, to $3.4 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue decreased 8% on lower average realized third-party price and lower shipments due to timing and decreased trading. In the aluminum segment, third-party revenue was flat due to an increase in the average realized third-party price offset by lower shipments in the first quarter after strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. First-quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $548 million versus the prior quarter of $202 million with earnings per common share more than doubling to $2.07 per share. The sequential improvement reflects increased aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination, partially offset by increased alumina costs and tariffs on our Canadian aluminum imported into the United States for U.S. customers. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Alcoa was $568 million or $2.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $178 million to $855 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. First-quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects higher aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination which more than offset lower aluminum prices. Lower volume, increases in raw material and energy prices, and higher production costs were more than offset by improvements in price mix and other costs. Lower volume in the first quarter was expected after a strong fourth-quarter shipping schedule. Mainly alumina from our Australian refineries. Other costs primarily relate to intersegment elimination. The Aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $52 million primarily due to lower alumina prices, lower volume, and unfavorable currency impacts only partially offset by favorable production costs and other costs. The aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $60 million with higher metal prices and favorable currency more than offset by higher alumina costs and higher production, energy, raw material, and other costs. Included in other costs are approximately $20 million for U.S. Section 232 tariffs of 25% on aluminum imports from Canada which became effective on March 12. Outside the segment, other corporate costs decreased and the intersegment elimination expense decreased as expected with significantly lower average alumina price requiring less inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with cash of $1.2 billion. Strong EBITDA led to positive cash from operations in the first quarter despite high consumption of cash for working capital build which is typical in our first quarter period. Working capital increased as inventories in both segments rose. In alumina, on higher raw material price and volume, and in aluminum on timing of raw material and aluminum shipments. Accounts payable decreased following elevated alumina trading payables in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we progressed our objective to reposition debt and delever with the issuance of $1 billion of debt in Australia and the tender of $890 million related to our outstanding 2027 and 2028 notes. It is our intention to continue to delever with an initial focus on the remainder of the 2027 notes. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity was positive at 39.1%. Days working capital increased 13 days sequentially to 47 days. The same level year over year, but elevated from our year-end 2024 low. Our first-quarter dividend added $26 million to stockholder capital reach. We had positive free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions for the quarter, includes the €25 million contribution from Ignis EQT related to the San Ciprian joint venture formation. Proceeds from the debt issuance in Australia less debt tendered added $95 million to the ending cash balance of $1.2 billion. As we turn to the next slide, I would like to share an update on our capital allocation target. Our overall capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It starts with maintaining a strong balance sheet throughout the cycle, and sufficiently funding our operations to sustain and improve them. The optimal capital structure for our company is reached when investment-grade leverage metrics are achieved reducing our WACC and creating value for our stockholders through a higher company valuation lower cost of financing and improved project viability. We want to maintain investment-grade leverage metrics throughout all business cycles not only at the mid or top part of the cycle. Based on this, we first defined a target for adjusted debt which includes pension and OPEB liabilities. This target is $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. Then considering our historical use rate of cash, we target a cash balance between $1 million and $1.5 million. Netting the cash with the adjusted debt, results in our targeted range of adjusted net debt of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We believe this range fits our profile and anticipated use of leverage as a company. I want to clarify that we are not committing to receiving and or maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. The credit ratings are assessed by the rating agencies. We want to maintain the flexibility to raise additional debt for strategic upper at any point in the cycle. Our adjusted net debt was $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. As we get closer to the $1 billion to $1.5 billion target, we will look at all of our capital allocation priorities including cash returns to stockholders and parallel to paying down debt. Turning to the outlook. We have one adjustment to our full-year outlook. We are updating depreciation expense from $640 million to $620 million due primarily to favorable currency impact. For the second quarter of 2025, in the Alumina segment, we expect to maintain the strong level of performance delivered in the first quarter. In the aluminum segment, we expect performance to be unfavorable by approximately $105 million due to U.S. Section 232 tariff costs on imports of our Canadian aluminum. Increasing approximately $90 million sequentially. As well as operating costs associated with the restart of the San Ciprian smelter of approximately $15 million. Aluminum cost in the aluminum segment expected to be favorable by $165 million. For intersegment eliminations with the current market volatility, we recommend that you use the low end of the sensitivity range in your model. Below EBITDA, within other expenses, quarter. The first quarter included favorable impacts of $20 million due to foreign currency gains, which may not recur. Based on last week's pricing, we expect second-quarter operational tax to be a benefit of $50 million to $60 million which includes timing and catch-up adjustments related to lower alumina prices. In the appendix to the earnings material, you will see that our Midwest paid and Midwest unpaid premium sensitivities have been updated to reflect the expected trade flows as a result of tariff impacts. We also revised our regional premium distribution for your reference. Updates to the Midwest premium do not include the cost component of the tariffs. There is a new column on the sensitivity slide for the tariff cost impact which will appear in the other bar of our EBITDA bridge. Since the second quarter will be the first full quarter of tariffs, you should consider a quarterly tariff cost of approximately $105 million as a baseline calculated based on an LME of $2,400 and a Midwest premium of $0.39 per pound. We will update our sensitivities as needed our trade flows adjust to the tariff structure. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.
