And then, you know, you had the cost curve on alumina, but I'm wondering where alumina pricing is tracking today. As well as, you know, potentially challenging fundamental backdrop ahead do you think the marginal cost support of aluminum stands today globally?William Oplinger: As of today, as I said in my prepared remarks, over 80% of the Chinese refining system is underwater. And so we believe that there's good support level at today's pricing. We just saw today, in know, this is very recent news, that alumina prices came back up overnight by $17. So, you know, it feels like there's some support at the levels that it's at. Now that is all based on, bauxite pricing. And bauxite pricing has been strong through the first three and a half months of the year. And it still sits at $80 to $85 a ton bauxite pricing and that is support for alumina cost. William Peterson: Thanks, Scott. William Oplinger: Thanks, William. The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina: Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on San Ciprian. So the slide that you have here, you talk about the impact on 2025 and then also the hedging strategy. You've deployed it to mitigate financial risk from 2025 to 2027. So if we're looking at don't know, $100 million to $120 million of negative cash flow from the restart of the smelter in 2025, what happens beyond 2025?How do the hedges help?And then secondly, I think there was, you know, the guidance had been that if you burn through roughly $200 million at San Ciprian comes to a point where you just can't continue to subsidize this?And does this hedging strategy that you refer to here protect you from that over the 2025 to 2027 period?

Molly Beerman: First, I'll take this one. Fortunately, we did start to put the hedges in place several weeks ago, and we have secured hedge pricing that will help us to manage the cost within the funding envelope. We are focused year by year on 2025. We released the guidance for the smelter. We expect to lose about $70 million to $90 million in EBITDA. The cash used by those operations will be about $90 million to $110 million. The CapEx that we referred to is already included in our CapEx guidance. William Oplinger: It's important to remember also that a portion of that CapEx, we would need to spend anyway. A portion of that CapEx is going toward the raise of the refinery Red Bud Lake that no matter whether we were running it or not, we would need to be able to make that because it also assists us in the final closure of that Red Muttling. Chris LaFemina: Right. And could you quantify what the EBITDA impact would be in 2026 if you assume that prices don't change?I mean, how much of that $70 million to $90 million negative impact in 2025 is a function of restart and kind of other one-off costs that I'm not going to repeat?And also much of that is protected by tariffs and sorry, by your hedging in 2026?In other words, is this going to be $70 million to $90 million a year or is it going to be a lot less than that in terms of the loss in 2026, if we assume prices don't change?Molly Beerman: The smelter losses are heavier in 2025 because we have the inefficient of the restarts. We've not yet released the 2026 numbers, Chris. We'll look to do that as we get closer to the end of the year. Chris LaFemina: Okay. Thank you. Operator: The next question is from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead. Nick Giles: Thanks, operator. Good evening, everyone. My first question was, you mentioned the higher scrutiny on future alumina production in China. But if 80% are unprofitable today what do you think it will ultimately take for Chinese aluminum refineries to curtail output?William Oplinger: We're seeing part of it today already. The Chinese, in my history in the industry. And so we're seeing it today with maintenance outages, extended maintenance outages. So, you know, I really believe that they will react quickly to loss-making sites. Nick Giles: Thanks for that, Bill. And then maybe just a follow-up there. You mentioned spot bauxite opportunities in one q, and so with the lower alumina prices but bauxite prices remaining more resilient. Could it make sense to reduce alumina production and sell more bauxite directly to Chinese?

William Oplinger: I think the economics would be really, really difficult to do that. And the reason why I say that is the marginal tons that you run through the refinery are generally pretty low cost. And so I don't believe and I don't I haven't looked at the numbers recently. But I don't believe it would support curtailing refining capacity to sell bauxite into China. So I just don't think that would solve at this point.
