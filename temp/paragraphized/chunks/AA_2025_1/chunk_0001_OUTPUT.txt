Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website.Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.William Oplinger: Thanks, Louis, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call.Alcoa had strong first-quarter financial and production results.We maintained a fast pace of execution on our priorities despite economic uncertainty while progressing operational excellence through safety, stability, and continuous improvement.Underlying the strength of our performance were positive market conditions.

Let's start with safety.First and foremost, a strong safety culture supports operational excellence.We had no fatal or serious injuries in the first quarter, and we continue to improve our safety performance.Operational stability is shown by solid production, where the majority of our operations improved sequentially on a tons-per-day basis.We also continued to improve stability at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, currently operating at approximately 91% capacity.We completed a $1 billion debt offering in Australia using most of the proceeds to repay existing debt.

The new debt has extended the maturities at a lower after-tax interest expense than our previously outstanding debt.Lastly, we formed a joint venture with Ignis EQT for our San Ciprian operations and are now resuming production at the smelter in accordance with the viability agreement.Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the strong financial results.
