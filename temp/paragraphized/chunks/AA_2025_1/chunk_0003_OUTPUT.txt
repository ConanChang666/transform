William Oplinger: Thanks, Molly.Let me take the opportunity to speak to the current status of U.S. Tariffs applicable to the aluminum industry from Alcoa's perspective.The U.S. section 232 tariff structure has been in place for some time, in March, the tariff increased from 10% to 25% and the exemption for Canadian metal imported into the U.S. was removed.This is the most material impact on Alcoa.As approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers.We are now subject to 25% tariff cost, which totals an estimated $400 to $425 million annually.

Of course, there is a higher Midwest premium, which offsets some of this cost and certainly benefits our U.S. smelters but currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business.Next are the IEEPA tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China.Since our aluminum products and the majority of our input materials from Canada and Mexico qualify under the USMCA provisions, Alcoa does not have a significant impact from this tariff at this time.The reciprocal tariffs specifically exclude Canada and Mexico, as well as aluminum products already subject to Section 232 tariffs.So no impact on Alcoa's aluminum sales.While alumina and other raw materials are excluded from the is now subject to the high reciprocal tariff.

We expect these tariffs will increase our input cost by $10 to $15 million annually as there are no suitable replacement suppliers.In 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.2 million metric tons of primary aluminum, with imports of Canadian aluminum representing approximately 70% or 2.9 million metric tons.The four operating slippers in the U.S. produce 700,000 metric tons of aluminum each year, If all idle smelting capacity in the U.S. would restart, which approximately 600,000 metric tons, the U.S. would still be short by 3.6 million metric tons.It takes many years to build a new smelter and at least five to six smelters would be required to address the U.S. demand for primary aluminum.These new smelters would require additional energy production equivalent to almost seven new nuclear reactors.Or more than ten Hoover dams. Until additional smelting capacity is built in the U.S., the most efficient aluminum supply chain is Canadian aluminum flowing into the U.S. That being said, our global smelting portfolio and commercial experience give us options to shift metal supply as needed if trade policies and economics warrant.

We've operated for more than 135 years in the aluminum industry.Building on our experience, we will continue our engagement efforts with the U.S. government and policymakers to advocate for the best outcome possible.Now let's discuss our market.In alumina, after reaching an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2024, alumina prices declined in the first quarter of 2025.This was due to relatively higher liquidity, mainly driven by the Chinese refinery ramp-ups and normalized production outside China following several disruptions last year.As well as more recent alumina price declines on softened sentiment given global market uncertainty.

The market has resolved most of the issues leading to a tightness in 2024, there is still uncertainty about the timing of the planned refinery ramp-ups in Indonesia and India this year.With bauxite prices remaining relatively high, and the current lower alumina price, we estimate that over 80% of Chinese refineries are unprofitable.Additionally, a recent announcement by the Chinese government stated that there would be higher scrutiny on new alumina projects regarding air pollution control, off-site sourcing, and red mud processing, which could bring additional constraints on growth in Chinese alumina production and may accelerate curtailment.This is a dynamic market and Alcoa's global network of refineries provides security and supply of alumina both to Alcoa smelters and our major customers which are primarily in the milli.A final point to highlight here is the opportunity we had in the first quarter to capitalize on tightness in the Bauxite market.The high prices in the first quarter, we participated in the spot markets capture benefits for some volumes from our joint venture in Guinea.

Let's move on to Alimida.The LME aluminum price was generally resilient in the first quarter even with the decreasing aluminum price.With tariff announcements earlier this month, the LME responded by turning lower reflecting the uncertainty of the impact of tariffs on the global economy and aluminum market.The Midwest premium increased with the introduction of tariffs, it has not reached the $880 to $990 per ton level, which analysts predict supports shipments from any region to the U.S. Logistics still favor shipments from Canada to the U.S. compared to other potential major suppliers.In our view, the Midwest premium has not fully responded due to the uncertain mark settlement as well as inventory build in the U.S. ahead of the tariffs.The depletion of these inventories should trigger some upward response.

Despite the uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariffs, there were some supportive signs on the demand side in the first quarter.Namely the Chinese stimulus and European fiscal loosening.Aluminum supply growth in the first quarter was very limited as smelter ramp-ups were offset by the effect of closures that took place at the end of last year.North America, our aluminum value-add product shipment volumes increased both sequentially and year over year with healthy demand for slab, billet, and rod.However, it is difficult to say whether our customers were anticipating tariffs and therefore buying in advance.In Europe, there were slightly lower VAT volumes in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, but up year over year with strong demand for rod and slab and billet demand finally improving.

For both regions, we saw the negative impact of tariffs in our foundry order book which is closely tied with the automotive market and faces the largest amount of uncertainty from the tariff impact.Turning to Spain, we recently announced the formation of the joint venture with Ignis EQT support the continued operation of the San Ciprian complex.The idle smoking capacity is now being restarted to meet our obligation under the viability agreement, which was signed with our workforce when we curtailed the smelter in 2021, due to exorbitant energy prices.We are now focused on safely restarting the idle capacity.We will focus on repeating the strong operational results delivered in the first quarter.However, we are now adding the challenge of navigating uncertainty in our markets.

A good time to consider the actions we've taken both recently and in the past to be well positioned to address adversity and capture opportunity.As a pure-play aluminum company, vertically integrated from mine to metal with a global footprint and cost-effective portfolio of assets, Alcoa has the ability to maneuver and respond to challenging and changing markets and policies.Security of supply through long-term contracts is valued by our customers.We also have the most comprehensive low-carbon product portfolio in the aluminum industry to meet customer needs.The company has a significant cash balance a strong capital structure, with no near-term debt maturities or other obligations requiring significant cash outlays beyond normal operations.We've taken strategic actions that strengthened the company over time including the recent acquisition of Alumina Limited and the announcement of the sale of the Modern Joint Ventures.

Which is expected to close in the second quarter.We have a track record of monetizing non-core assets including transformation sites, which drive value for our stockholders.We also executed initiatives to be more cost-effective as demonstrated by our over-delivering our $645 million profitability program last year.These competitive advantages and actions support Alcoa's resilience.

In summary, as we close up the presentation, Alcoa had a strong first quarter with improved safety and stable production.As a company, we made good progress on strategic actions.Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a fast pace of execution on our 2025 key areas of focus and strategic initiatives, improve the competitiveness of our operations, and navigate market challenges to deliver value to our stockholders.Operator, let's start the question and answer portion of the session.
