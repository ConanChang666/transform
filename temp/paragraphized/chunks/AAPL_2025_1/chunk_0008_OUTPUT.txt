<think> 好的，我现在需要处理用户的请求，将提供的逐字稿片段整理成段落式逐字稿。首先，我要仔细阅读用户的要求。用户强调不能删除或改写任何内容，必须保持原样。这意味着我需要非常注意逐句转换，确保每个发言者的每一句话都完整保留，同时按顺序排列成段落。接下来，我需要分析提供的逐字稿结构。原文是一个问答环节，包括几个问题和回答，发言者交替出现。

每个发言者的名字后面跟着他们的问题或回答，每行是一句话。我的任务是将这些分行的内容转换为段落，每次发言者的发言合并成一个更连贯的段落，但不能改变内容或顺序。我需要确定每个发言者之间的转换，确保在正确的地方换行。例如，当Krish Sankar提问后，Tim Cook回答，接着Krish Sankar继续提问，然后Kevan Parekh回答。这种交替的模式需要在转换时保持清晰，可能需要使用空行或适当的换行来分隔不同的发言者。还要注意发言者的名字是否正确，以及他们的发言是否连贯。

例如，Kevan Parekh的回答较长，包含多个要点，需要确保每个要点之间的过渡自然，但不需要添加任何内容或修改原文。同时，检查是否有重复的内容，比如Krish Sankar两次说“Got it”，在转换时不能省略。在处理过程中，可能会遇到一些挑战，比如如何区分不同话题的转变，或者如何确保换行不会影响阅读的流畅性。

此外，需要确保所有发言者的发言都被正确归类，没有遗漏或错误分配。例如，Suhasini Chandramouli在某个点之后开始主持，之后由Operator传达下一个问题，这部分也需要正确分段处理。最后，完成初步转换后，我需要通读整个转换后的段落，确认是否所有内容都被保留，没有遗漏或错误转换。同时，检查格式是否符合用户的要求，比如是否使用了正确的换行，发言者名字是否在每个新的发言段落之前正确显示。确保没有使用任何格式标记，如Markdown，而是纯文本，但用户要求输出无需Markdown格式，因此需要保持段落清晰，可能用空行分隔不同发言者。总结来说，步骤应该是：1. 逐行阅读原始逐字稿；2. 标记每个发言者及其发言内容；3. 将连续的发言合并为段落；4. 使用空行分隔不同的发言者；5. 检查转换后的内容是否完整准确，确保每一条发言都保留原样。

这样用户的需求就能得到满足，同时保持内容的完整性和可读性。</think> Krish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?Tim Cook: I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products. Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin?Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?Kevan Parekh: Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%. Krish Sankar: Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim. Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead. Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it?

Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI?And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream?Thanks. Tim Cook: I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further. Richard Kramer: Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?Kevan Parekh: Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell. Richard Kramer: Okay, thanks.
