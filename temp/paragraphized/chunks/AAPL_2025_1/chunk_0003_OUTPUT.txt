Kevan Parekh: Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone.I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year.We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year.We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track.

Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac.Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices.Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets.Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix.

Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage.Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix.Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year.This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year.Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision.Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year.

We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia.The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment.We also set an all-time record for upgraders.According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan.We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research.Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year.

We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment.With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac.The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac.

Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air.The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product.Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research.Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year.

Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2.On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%.Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future.We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings.

Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year.Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits.We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform.We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets.Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services.Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division.

And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences.We also see strong demand in our emerging markets.For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation.In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning.Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program.We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities.

We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt.Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion.During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders.This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares.As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.

The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter.As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year.We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year.When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter.We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%.

We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion.We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025.With that, let's open to call the questions.
