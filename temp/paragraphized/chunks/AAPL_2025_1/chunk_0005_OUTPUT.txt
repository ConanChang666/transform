**Ben Reitzes:** Oh, great.All right.Thanks, Tim.And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future?Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going?I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years.

Thanks. **Tim Cook:** I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline.So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone. **Ben Reitzes:** Thanks a lot, Tim. **Tim Cook:** Yes, thank you. **Suhasini Chandramouli:** Thank you, Ben.Operator, could we have the next question, please? **Operator:** Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.Please go ahead. **Michael Ng:** Good afternoon.Thank you for the question.I have two as well.

First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now.I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to?Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in?Thanks. **Tim Cook:** Yes, thank you for the question.If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before.The installed base hit a new all-time high as well.

And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade.And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not.So lots... **Michael Ng:** Great, thank you, Tim.That's... **Tim Cook:** Yes, lots of good color there. **Michael Ng:** Great, thank you, Tim.That's very clear.

And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version.I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro.How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor?Thank you. **Tim Cook:** It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad.But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%.It's a great achievement for the quarter.

And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad.So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract. **Michael Ng:** Thank you very much, Tim. **Tim Cook:** Yes.Thank you. **Suhasini Chandramouli:** Thanks, Mike.Operator, could we have the next question, please? **Operator:** Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.Please go ahead. **Amit Daryanani:** Good afternoon, everyone.I have two as well.

Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products?Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets?And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through? **Tim Cook:** We have great results in a number of emerging markets.And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India.India set a December quarter record during the quarter.And we're opening more stores there.

We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there.We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter.And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets.And so I think there's lots of upside there.And that's just one of the emerging markets. **Kevan Parekh:** Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well.So that's also an encouraging sign.
