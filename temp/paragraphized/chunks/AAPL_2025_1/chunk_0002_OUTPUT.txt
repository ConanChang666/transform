<think> Alright, let's tackle this user request. The user wants me to convert a verbatim transcript into a paragraph-style one without deleting any content. The example provided has Tim Cook's speech from an Apple call. First, I need to understand the structure of the original text. It's a transcript with each speaker's line in a separate line. The user wants these lines grouped into coherent paragraphs, making it more readable. The example response shows how the assistant grouped the lines into paragraphs based on the flow of the speech. For instance, the part where Tim Cook talks about the wildfires and Apple's contribution is kept as a single paragraph, while the financial results are another paragraph. The key here is to maintain the original content without any alterations. I need to read through the entire transcript and identify where natural pauses or shifts in topic occur. For example, after discussing the wildfires, Tim moves on to the financial results, which is a new section. Similarly, when he talks about different product lines (iPhone, Mac, iPad), each product's section is a separate paragraph. I also need to watch for transitions between topics. Sometimes a speaker might start a new sentence in the middle of a paragraph, but in the original transcript, each line is separated. My task is to group these lines into paragraphs where the content continues to discuss the same topic without introducing a new one. Another thing to note is the use of lists or numbered items. For example, when Tim lists the countries where Apple Intelligence was expanded, each country is mentioned in separate lines. In the example response, these were combined into a single sentence using commas, which is appropriate. Similarly, features like Apple Intelligence's tools were grouped into a paragraph with items separated by commas. I should also check for any long sentences that might be split into multiple lines in the original transcript. If the original lines are parts of the same sentence, they should be combined without adding or removing any words. For instance, if a sentence starts at the end of one line and continues in the next, they should be merged accordingly. Moreover, the user emphasized not to summarize or delete any content. So, every single line from the original transcript must be present in the paragraph-style version. This includes any repeated information or detailed statistics. Let me walk through a section of the example. Tim Cook starts by thanking Suhasini and the audience. The original transcript has these as separate lines. The assistant combined them into a paragraph where the speaker addresses the audience and mentions the wildfires. Then, after acknowledging the disasters, the speaker moves to financial results. I need to ensure that the transition between these two sections is clear and that each paragraph is dedicated to a single topic. I'll also need to pay attention to the structure of the financial results section, which includes multiple product lines (iPhone, Mac, iPad, etc.). Each product's revenue and its details should be grouped into their own paragraphs. Similarly, the services segment, Apple TV+, retail, and customer stories are separate paragraphs. For the customer stories part, the original transcript has multiple lines about different users. These should be combined into a coherent paragraph, making sure the sequence of examples is preserved. Sometimes, there are sentences that link the examples, so I need to maintain those connections. I'll also check for any typos or formatting issues in the original transcript that might need correction, but the user hasn't mentioned that, so probably not necessary unless it affects readability. However, the example response didn't correct any such issues, just restructured the lines. Another aspect is the use of commas and conjunctions to make the sentences flow. For example, when listing countries or features, the original transcript uses line breaks, but in the paragraph version, these are combined with commas for better readability. I should also ensure that any technical terms or proper nouns are correctly placed with their descriptions. For instance, when mentioning products like iPhone 16 Pro models, the original lines might be split, but they need to be correctly grouped with their features. In summary, the process involves reading through the original transcript, identifying the natural grouping of related lines, and merging them into paragraphs without adding or removing any content. The goal is to enhance readability by organizing the information into logical sections while preserving the speaker's exact words. </think> **段落式逐字稿**：。Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.
