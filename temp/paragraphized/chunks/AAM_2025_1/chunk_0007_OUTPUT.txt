David Dauch: Tom, this is David.Listen, Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he was campaigning as he wants to build a strong manufacturing base in the U.S. He wants to support and strengthen the U.S. auto industry.He wants to bring jobs back to America and strengthen our economy.We're going through a bumpy road right now.We all just seem to be patient and work our way through this whole thing together and not overreact.At the same time, when we get to the other side, I think America will be much stronger.

At the same time, he's driving a lot of investment by foreign companies into the U.S. instead of a lot of money going offshore, it's going to stay in the U.S. and it's going to create those jobs for Americans here.I mean part of the concern, it was kind of raised by Joe earlier, is labor availability.There's a lot of open jobs today.That's why I think automation, robotics and other things are going to have to come into play in order to be able to support the amount of jobs that potentially can be created with the policies that are put into place.But make no mistake, I mean, Trump is just attacking the tariff and balance that existed for decades.And he's just trying to level the playing field to give the U.S. auto industry and other industries for that matter, a competitive-playing filed or a level-playing field to do business on.

And if we didn't, then there is a risk of some of those businesses being at risk longer term.And so, overall, I'm very supportive of what he's doing or we're supportive of what he's doing.It has created some issues as far as additional work for all of us.But at the same time, you do what you need to do to manage through these tough times.But at the same time, as we said in our comments, Chris and I, together, we see this as an ultimate positive when it's all said and done, and we think that we can actually gain business, especially through our metal forming business with a lot of the onshoring and the reshoring that needs to take place here.So, we're just staying true to our policies and our procedures about buying and building local.

We're trying to leverage our capacities wherever needed and we're coming to our customers with solutions to help them address some of the concerns and some of the issues that exist right now.So that's my view, Chris, I don't know if you have anything else you want to comment on.Chris May: [indiscernible] exactly.Tom Narayan: All right.Thanks a lot.David Dauch: Yeah, thank you.

Operator: The next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.Please go ahead.James Picariello: Hi, good morning, guys.My question is on GM.They announced the 50,000 annualized units moving from Mexico to their Fort Wayne plant.And just curious, will they be able to in-source -- like fully in-source and support those axles?

Or is there a situation whereby you guys come in and supply the full driveline system at the Fort Wayne plant?David Dauch: Yes.I mean, Fort Wayne today is being supported by both AAM and General Motors.So yes, there's an incremental volume that's going there.At the same time, GM has got contractual obligations, and we'd expect them to honor those contractual obligations.But as I said earlier, we'll work collectively with our customer in this case, GM, to manage that opportunity there.

But they're responding appropriately to what Trump has asked them to do in regards to looking at bringing certain work back to the U.S., plus they're also mitigating their own financial exposure due to the tariffs.We respect all those decisions, and we'll support our customer whatever way we need to on this going forward.But we do supply all the GM assembly plants around North America based on the portfolio that we have in place and the plans that we have in place.So, we're supplying Fort Wayne, Arlington, Flint, Oshawa and [indiscernible], so -- but we'll just have to work that out with the customer as we get a little bit more clarity.James Picariello: So, the content for AAM is very similar in terms of the Mexico versus Fort Wayne?David Dauch: Absolutely.

At the same time, GM only has so much installed capacity on the axle side based on the agreements that we have.And like I said, there's contractual obligations there as well.But we'll work with them if they permanently reload things, we'll have to have those discussions about what we need to do on a go-forward basis.James Picariello: Got it.And then, just a housecleaning thing.I think I missed the clarification.

The business that you sold in the first quarter here that shows up in the cash flow statement.Is that -- is the India business that, that we talked about likely getting sold in the second half, or is it something different?
