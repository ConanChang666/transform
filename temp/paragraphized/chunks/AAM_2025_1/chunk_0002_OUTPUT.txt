David Dauch: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.Thank you for joining us today to discuss AAM's financial results for the first quarter of 2025.Joining me on the call today is Chris May, AAM's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.To begin my comments, I'll review the highlights of our first quarter financial performance.

Next, I'll touch on some AAM business updates, commentary about the industry and guidance.After Chris covers the details of our financial results, we will open up the call for any questions that you may have.So, let's begin.AAM's first quarter 2025 sales were $1.41 billion.AAM's adjusted earnings per share was $0.09 per share.Operating cash flow was $55.9 million, and adjusted free cash flow was a use of $3.9 million.

North American production was down approximately 5% year-over-year.From a profitability perspective, AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $177 million or 12.6% of sales.On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA margin improved approximately 100 basis points based on our trend of a positive operational performance and continued cost controls.Let me talk about some business updates, which you can see on Slide 4.In the quarter, we exited our Hefei AAM automotive and Liuzhou AAM Automotive joint ventures in China.As a result, we collected approximately $30 million in cash.

These exits were a result of a comprehensive analysis of our product portfolio plan which balances numerous factors, including the focus on our core businesses and capital allocation.In addition, we also received approval from the Competition Commission of India, otherwise known as CCI, to proceed forward with our previously announced sale of our AAM commercial vehicle axle business to Bharat Forge Limited.Our expectation is that this deal will close in the second quarter of 2025.

Next, I'd like to give you a progress report on our transformational transaction with Dowlais to combine the GKN Automotive and Powder Metal businesses with AAM.As previously announced, this strong combination is anticipated to yield significant size and scale to better weather operating cycles, such as the one that we're experiencing today, deliver strong synergy potential for approximately $300 million in synergies, generate significant cash flow to support our focus on deleveraging and institute a more balanced capital allocation policy in the future.This strategic combination will unlock significant shareholder value and the teams are making great strides and working diligently together.On the financing side, the bridge syndication is completed.Our core credit agreement amendments have also been completed, and on the regulatory front, U.S. HSR antitrust clearance was received in March.

Additionally, we have now completed all other initial antitrust submissions with the required jurisdictions listed in the January announcement.Both AAM and Dowlais shareholders' votes are expected to take place in the third quarter.We are very excited about this transformational acquisition and the value it brings to our stakeholders.Our teams are working well together on the integration planning process, as I mentioned earlier.And we are on track to close this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2025.Now let's talk about the auto industry as a whole.

There's been plenty of macro uncertainty driven by new trade policies.But for AAM, our operating policy is to buy and build local.Approximately 90% of the products that we produce in North America are USMCA compliant, and we are evaluating other actions required to improve this percentage.Nearly all of our steel and aluminum buy is from the U.S. sources for North American production.What we produce in Mexico is predominantly delivered to our customers in Mexico, and we do have some open capacity to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. if needed.This will require close coordination with our OEM customers as they finalize their plant loading and respective production plans.

Specifically on tariffs, we are working diligently to mitigate what tariff impact we can -- what we can.And as far as the remainder, our intent is to pass those tariff costs on to our customers since they have the end market pricing power, which the supply base does not.Even in this world of tariff uncertainty, there are positives that leverage AAM strength.For example, we are receiving inquiries about our U.S. metal forming operations that will leverage our installed capacity as our customers are weighing onshore options to address the tariff concerns that are out there.Furthermore, as we combine with Dowlais, this combination and capability will be expanded and enhanced.And as communicated before, the AAM management team will stay focused on the matters that we can control and make necessary adjustments to our businesses based on market conditions.

Now, let's talk about our guidance.Recognizing we have a lot of data points, estimates and uncertainty, we have updated our 2025 guidance ranges.AAM is now targeting sales in the range of $5.65 billion to $5.95 billion.Adjusted EBITDA in the range of approximately $665 million to $745 million and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $165 million to $215 million.And our guidance ranges are supported by an assumed North American production volume of 14.0 million units on the bottom side, 15.1 million units on the top side.Chris will provide additional details on assumptions underpinning our guidance.

To say we are busy may be an understatement, but to say that we are excited about our future can't be overstated.Our core operations are gaining performance momentum that you can see in our results.Our combination with Dowlais is on track and gaining speed, and our experience of the past are guiding the AAM team to deal with the uncertainty of today in a positive and a constructive manner.And to conclude my remarks, our aim is on the future, and we're going to continue to drive our efforts towards, first and foremost, closing and integrating the Dowlais transaction, generating strong free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet, advancing our ICE hybrid and EV portfolio to be more agnostic and position AAM for future profitable growth.So now, let me turn the call over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Chris May, for his first quarter financial details.Chris?
