Chris May: Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone.I will cover the financial details of our first quarter 2025 results and our updated guidance with you today.I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments.So, let's go ahead and begin with sales.In the first quarter of 2025, AAM sales were $1.41 billion compared to $1.61 billion in the first quarter of 2024.Slide 8 shows a walk of first quarter 2024 sales to first quarter 2025 sales.

Volume mix and other was lower by $166 million, primarily driven by lower overall volumes in North America.Metal market pass‑throughs and FX lowered sales by approximately $28 million.More than half of this is related to foreign exchange, particularly from a weaker Brazilian real.Now, let's move on to profitability.Gross profit was $173.9 million in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to $198.5 million in the first quarter of 2024.For the first quarter of 2025, adjusted EBITDA was $177.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.6% versus $205.6 million and 12.8% last year.

You can see the year‑over‑year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on Slide 9.In the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was lower due to volume mix and other by $44 million versus the prior year, resulting in a decremental margin related to sales volume of approximately 27%.R&D was slightly lower year‑over‑year and performance and other was favorable to adjusted EBITDA by $13 million, driven primarily by operational improvements within our metal form business unit.Even with lower sales, the metal form EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points year‑over‑year and 370 basis points quarter‑over‑quarter.This performance is demonstrating our continued productivity improvements are driving profitability uplift.We continue to be very positive on the momentum of performance for both of AAM's business units.

Let me now cover SG&A.SG&A expense, including R&D, in the first quarter of 2025 was $90.9 million or 6.4% of sales.This compares to $98.3 million or 6.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2024.The AAM's R&D spending in the first quarter of 2025 was approximately $36 million, which, as I mentioned, is slightly lower year‑over‑year.For the full year, we expect R&D expense to be down on a year‑over‑year basis by approximately $20 million as we optimize our spend in this area to reflect current market requirements.Let's move on to interest and taxes.

Net interest expense was $37.3 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $40.7 million in the first quarter of 2024.The weighted average interest rate of our outstanding long‑term debt was lower year‑over‑year, and we also had lower debt balances.In the first quarter of 2025, we recorded income tax expense of $14 million compared to $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2024.As we head into 2025, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 50% at the midpoint.This elevated book tax rate is due to valuation allowances on certain foreign jurisdictions and interest deduction limitations in the U.S. We expect cash taxes of approximately $60 million to $75 million this year.Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $7.1 million or $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2025, compared to a net income of $20.5 million or $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2024.

Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of items noted in our earnings press release, was $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2025 compared to earnings per share of $0.18 for the first quarter of 2024.Let's now move to cash flow and the balance sheet.Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2025 was $55.9 million compared to $17.8 million in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong working capital performance in inventory and other areas.Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment for the first quarter of 2025 were $68.7 million.Cash payments for restructuring and acquisition‑related activity for the first quarter of 2025 were $8.9 million.Reflecting the impact of these activities, AAM's adjusted free cash flow was a seasonal use of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2025.

This was a significant improvement from prior year.From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.1 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $720.9 million, calculating a net leverage ratio of 2.9 times at March 31, 2025.We also maintained a very strong cash position of well over $500 million due to our operational performance and the benefit of the proceeds from the sale of our joint venture interests that David shared with you.AAM ended the quarter with total available liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion, consisting of available cash and borrowing capacity on AAM's global credit facilities.Now, let's talk about tariffs.There's been quite a bit of news on this front as it relates to regulation, rates and general updates.

To drill down a little deeper as it relates to AAM, we thought it best to provide you with the dimensions of our primary product movement, so you can better understand our positioning as it relates to tariffs.So, let's get started.For AAM, most of the products we ship to customers in North America, as David mentioned, are USMCA compliant.Almost all of AAM's steel and aluminum consumed in North America is from U.S.-based sources, so we are generally in a very good spot with these commodities.For our U.S. operations, we import from Mexico up to $150 million on an annual basis, the majority of which is USMCA compliant, and we are now evaluating how to reduce this amount even further.We import from Canada approximately $25 million on an annual basis, the majority of which is USMCA compliant, and we are also evaluating how to reduce this amount.

We directly import very little from China into the U.S. and therefore, have very minimal exposures here.And lastly, AAM's Rest of the World import exposures are approximately $100 million of annualized values, and we are working to mitigate these exposures as well as any additional exposures to our supply base may have while gaining clarity on final tariff agreements.As David stated, our intent is to work closely with our OEM customers to mitigate the tariff impact and receive recoveries for any incremental tariff costs.As we work through the year, and the respective recovery processes, there could be some timing lags, but overall, our assumption is clear.With that background in place, let's talk about our guidance on Slide 6.Our outlook has been adjusted from our initial targets provided on February 14.

The new outlook is designed to provide you with a framework or guideposts if you will, of our best estimate of the tariff‑related volume impact based on recent third‑party volume estimates.While some clarity has been provided as it relates to tariffs, we note that the situation is very fluid and dynamic.Our updated targets are as follows: For sales, our new range is $5.65 billion to $5.95 billion.This sales target is based upon a North America production range of 14.0 million to 15.1 million units and certain assumptions for our key programs. We continue to anticipate GM's full‑size pickup truck and SUV production in the range of 1.3 million to 1.4 million units in that range.From an EBITDA perspective, the range is now $665 million to $745 million.At the lower end versus previous guidance, this represents a flow‑through decremental margin in the low 20% range, which highlights AAM's intend to actively work our playbook to mitigate downside impacts should they occur.

At the higher end of our guidance, you can see our performance delivering very good profitability flow‑through.We now anticipate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $165 million to $215 million.Our CapEx assumption is unchanged at approximately 5% of sales as we ready the organization for important upcoming launches, especially for one of our major franchise truck programs. In addition, while not included in our adjusted free cash flow figures, we estimate our restructuring‑related payments for AAM as a stand‑alone entity to continue to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million for 2025 as we look to further optimize our business and further reduce fixed costs.As mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we are assuming the pending sale of our commercial vehicle axle business in India will be completed by the end of the first half of 2025 and our financial guidance reflects that timing.We underscore that the guidance figures we are providing today are on an AAM stand‑alone pre‑combination basis and exclude any costs or expenses related to our announced Dowlais transaction.AAM's first quarter results represent a very good start to the year, and we believe we still have work to do to drive even further performance.

We remain focused on executing our key performance drivers inside of our core business.We are also actively managing the evolving tariff environment, which continues to introduce new complexities and uncertainties in the industry.Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and also leverage the opportunities that they will present for us.Going forward, if we see a reduction in the level of macro uncertainty, tariff cost mitigation takes hold and industry production is stable, we believe the risk to our guidance may potentially be to the upside in that range, especially as we gain more momentum on our internal performance improvements, volume levels become more clear and new trade deals are negotiated.Thank you for your time and participation on the call today.I'm going to stop here and turn the call back over to David, so we can start Q&A.
