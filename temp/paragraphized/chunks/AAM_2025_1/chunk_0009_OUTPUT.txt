**可閱讀的段落式逐字稿**。John Murphy: Got it. Okay. And hopefully, that letter from customs yesterday holds because that means that you're in very good shape and don't need to do much if anything at all here in North America. One other, yes, I mean it seems like it's going to hold and you're fine. You don't have to move anything. John Murphy: On CARB and EVs, I mean, this is just not being discussed, but it's almost as consequential to the business at large or maybe even more consequential depending on where you sit in the value chain. But this cancellation of CARB and a significant slowdown in EVs, I'm just curious what you think that means to your business sort of mid- and long term?And what it means as far as maybe pulling back on R&D and other capital commitments that are not having much payoff, if at all, particularly in North America?David Dauch: So, John, this is David. I'll make some comments first, then open it up to Chris. But clearly, if we see ICE and hybrid activity continuing longer, I mean, that's a good thing for us because we already have installed assets and have more volume going across those assets. So that's a big positive for us. It will help us generate even more cash flow to be able to support what we need to do to fill out and complete our EV portfolio. David Dauch: Clearly, part of the acquisition at Dowlais that's important to us is expanding our EV capability and developing a more agnostic product portfolio. We have trimmed down some of our ER&D expenses year-over-year based on the fact that we have a lot of our electrification strategy put into place, but we do have some more to do. So, there's still work that's there. David Dauch: With that being said, we've been very selective about what electrification programs we'll go after and with which customers and on which platforms. And we're also trying to protect ourselves with respect to the appropriate terms and conditions because of the volatility that exists on the acceptance rates by consumers, especially here in North America. David Dauch: Electrifications here, it's only going to grow. It's just not going to grow at the rate that the prognosticators were forecasting earlier. The consumer has spoken, and it's going to take a lot longer. And ICE and hybrid are going to be here for decades. While EV is going to gain market share on a go-forward basis, it will be at a much slower ramp in North America than what people were projecting or predicting. John Murphy: David, I'm sorry, just to sneak one follow-up in there. It's fair to say that ICE program extensions are net positive for American Axle because there's some debate on that?David Dauch: Absolutely. Chris May: I'm not sure. I think they have a very clear [indiscernible]. We have a very strong installed capital base. We'll be able to leverage for a very long time, which will generate a lot of cash and profitability off of that. Your core operations are focusing on productivity on existing products. I mean there's nothing but good. John Murphy: I agree. All right. Thank you very much, guys. David Dauch: Thanks, John. Operator: Thank you, gentlemen. Your last question comes from Doug Karson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug Karson: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for sneaking me in here at the end. It wouldn't be a fun day without talking about the balance sheet for a moment. With the completion of this transaction, which looks like it's a green light, can you just reiterate like how you want to structure the balance sheet as far as leverage?And then, I have a more open-ended question considering you guys have been in the industry for my entire career. The OEMs are contemplating bringing back your potential assembly plants or various production. How hard do you think that's going to really be?

I know it's hard to make a comment on that. But I mean in my career, that's been a really slow process to move plants around. And I'm just kind of wondering like how you think about it when you're like at the watercooler like sharing ideas.
