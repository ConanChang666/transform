**David Dauch:** This is David.Let me start with the second question first and then Chris can cover the other question.We just talked earlier in regards to some of the OEMs evaluating what needs to be done.Listen, that's not an easy task, right?It's been decades to build up the infrastructure in the facility and the footprint that OEMs have and for that matter, suppliers as well.And it's billions of dollars to try to build a brand-new assembly plant, and it takes time to do that as well.

So, it's not like these jobs can move immediately.Some jobs can move based on line rate increases or if there's open capacity at an existing facility.But plants aren't just sitting there except waiting, they have to be retooled or built in their entirety for that.So this will take years to do.But at the same time, I think what the Trump administration is looking for is jobs to come back to the U.S., commitments made by OEMs, and he's obviously having discussions with each of the OEMs. You've seen the amount of commitments that have been made both from the Detroit 3 as well as the international OEMs. A lot of investment already been announced and jobs to be created, it's just a matter of the timing to ultimately complete those initiatives that are taking place.So, I think the intent that Trump has to bring work back to the U.S. is working.

It's just -- it's going to be costly and it's going to be timely in order to be able to get that done.And like I said, it just doesn't happen overnight.Obviously, we've got a global footprint and infrastructure.We leverage that to try to buy and bill local for the local markets.And as Chris said, what we're making in Mexico is for the most part consumed in Mexico or a large part of it.Same thing here in the U.S. But we'll balance that based on what the needs are and what the requirements are of the administration and our customers. **Chris May:** Yeah, Doug, this is Chris.

Let's dial back over -- back to your first part of your question on the balance sheet as it relates to the larger transaction with Dowlais.We're in great shape from that perspective.The bridge has been syndicated.We have now amended and adjusted our core revolver as a stand‑alone company for AAM, but also it's positioned very well now for the transaction to put us plenty of capacity where we need there from $1.5 billion in terms of revolver capacity.But we're very focused also on having a nice maturity table at close.I think we'll accomplish that once we go to market near the end of the year when we close the transaction.

And then, we're heavily focused, as you know, on leverage.So today, a stand‑alone American Axle, we closed March at 2.9 times.Our goal, at least at close of the transaction for -- with Dowlais would be to be approximately leverage neutral to that.And as we go forward, our primary source of our cash flow, obviously, is from our operations and the strong synergy opportunity that we'll see.That cash flow in turn will then delever the company the objective an initial step, if you will, to 2.5 times.At that point, we'll continue to delever the company further.

However, we'll also open up the capital allocation playbook at that level to, I'll call it, other shareholder type activity.But deleveraging and strengthening the balance sheet is a top priority for us today as a stand‑alone company.It will be a top priority for us as a combined company together. **Doug Karson:** Thanks.And it seems that with the additional new business that the delevering could potentially even be accelerated from the prior plan.It sounds like that.And if that's true, that would be great. **David Dauch:** Yeah.

Agree. **Doug Karson:** Thanks, guys. **David Dauch:** All right, thanks, Doug. **Chris May:** Thanks, Doug. **David Lim:** Thank you, Doug, and we thank all of you who have participated on this call, and we look forward to talking with you soon in the future.Thank you. **Operator:** The conference has now concluded.Thank you for attending today's presentation.You may now disconnect.
