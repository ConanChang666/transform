以下是改寫為「段落式逐字稿」的內容：。David Lim: Thank you, Chris and David. We have reserved some time to take questions. I would ask that you please limit your questions to no more than two. So at this time, please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have. Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joe Spak with UBS. Please go ahead. Joe Spak: Good morning. I guess I just want to, I guess, start the conversation talking about how you're thinking about some potential future contingencies. I know you mentioned you do have some excess capacity in the U.S., like maybe you could give us a sense as to sort of what utilization is there. And then, even if you wanted to sort of up that, I know about a year ago, we were sort of talking about some labor challenges. So, is that something else we need to consider in that situation?David Dauch: Yeah, Joe, this is David. Good morning to you. Obviously, our policy is to buy and build local like we've communicated. So, we want -- our products are larger products. We want to be in close proximities to our customers. That's what we've done. That's what we'll continue to do. What we need to do is just get clarity from the government and our OEMs, to be honest with you, not only their long-range financial -- or long-range product plans but also their plant loading and product requirements. And then from there, we'll make the necessary adjustments that we need to make to support our business and do to, like I said in my opening comments, in concert with the customers. We try to drive high capacity utilization in our facilities. But we do have some open capacity in Three Rivers. We exited out of program. So we have some open capacity in our Three Rivers facility that we could accommodate. At the same time, we have some open capacity in a couple of other smaller facilities that we can make some adjustments and realign our operations where we moved some of our component and machining operations to maybe some of the smaller plants to free up open space in the larger plants, more of the assembly operations. And then, as I mentioned, with Dowlais, assuming that, that deal goes through at the end of the year here, we'll pick up even more capacity in the U.S., which will give us more of an opportunity to work with that. Overall, we always try to drive our capacity utilization at a minimum to that 85% level. But obviously, we've got a little bit of latitude there that we'll work with our customers, and we're willing to make the necessary adjustments that we need to, to support our customers on a go-forward basis. On the labor side of things, the labor situation has improved. I wouldn't say it's fixed. Obviously, everyone's got to pay at market to be able to attract the appropriate talent. But even with that being said, if more jobs are required to come back to the states that I think it's also going to require a greater level of robotics and automation to be able to deal with things on a go-forward basis. And quite honestly, we're doing a lot of that already ourselves. But at the same time, if we need to add incremental volume to that, then we'll accelerate those initiatives even further. Hopefully, that addresses your question. Joe Spak: Yeah. Thanks for that. The second question is -- and again, I'm not sure what you can say here, although presumably, you have been doing diligence on this as well. But can you help us understand what some of the tariff exposure would look like for Dowlais?Chris May: Yeah, Joe, this is Chris. I'll take that. In terms of Dowlais exposure, obviously, they need to comment on them as a stand-alone company. We're not at liberty to speak on their behalf. However, if you look at their footprint, in many cases, very similar to us. They have U.S. production, Mexico production. They also have a European footprint, and they're managing their tariff exposure in a very similar way that we are. And as David mentioned, so combined will bring us even more, I would call it, size and scale and production locations to navigate through exactly the same items that we're talking about here today. So we actually see some benefits as we combine together in this topic. Joe Spak: Thanks for that. Operator: The next question is from Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Edison Yu: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. David Dauch: Good morning. Edison Yu: So, first off, GM obviously had earnings this week, and they seem pretty, I would say, positive on the volume outlook. Are you incorporating that in the assumptions in the guidance on the full-sized trucks?
