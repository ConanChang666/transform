Timo Ihamuotila: Yes, I mean maybe just add there of course it's important also what ABB will look like after the spin happens and there we are seeing increased gross margin, maybe 40 basis points increased operating margin, maybe 50 basis points, clearly higher return on capital.I think the growth rates probably will be about similar.If you look at history, we would also have a notch higher there.So it really kind of like shows that these are a little bit different kind of companies.Ann-Sofie Nordh: And with that we have a question coming through from Alex at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Alex Virgo: Yes, thanks Ansi.

Morning Morten, Timo.I appreciate you taking the question.I wanted to talk about electrification if I could please and I appreciate it.It's one question with two parts.Question on the acceleration on the growth guide into Q2.Low double digits very strong.

I just wondered if you could give us a sense of what's driving that and the visibility that you obviously got on Q2 but for the full year.And just linked to that the margin expansion.You mentioned about a month or so ago in a conference the differential on margins between the North American business and the rest of the world in electrification.I just wondered if we're starting to see that gap starting to close as we see the margins moving up here and whether that's something that can accelerate through the year.Thank you.Morten Wierod: Yes.

So let's start on the Q2 growth outlook.So we have some of the revenue where we were a bit short in Q1.We saw that some of those deliveries were slipping over to Q2.So that's why we are confident we have a strong order backlog and order book now being on a record high level.Even if we just mention like on electrification it grew by another 11% in Q1.Even if the order growth just for the quarter were 2% but the order book increased by another - up 11%.

So that's a good set up in and a good outlook when it comes to the second quarter.And we talk about margin expansion as we say there in especially for the we mentioned that in the electrification businesses North America is diluted to the electrification margin.It still was in Q1.It will still be in Q2 but that gap is getting smaller.And I think that's the focus for the team and has been for several years and how we can close the gap to the rest of the world level.So we have - you will see not just in electrification but have all four business areas are expecting a margin improvement for the full year.

So I'm sure Timo can mention a bit about the one-off that special but the operational performance is expected to increase in all four of our business areas at the year end.Timo Ihamuotila: Do you want me to throw it now?A bit of an opening there.So when we look at this I mean when you look at our corporate guidance last year we had a very strong sort of corporate performance.We were about $150 million.Now we're saying $200 million.

So that would be a bit of a negative on the full year.But when you combine that with e-mobility, we are going to see some tens of basis points positive on that whole corporate e-mobility combined.And then as Morten said, also the businesses, we are expecting them to improve.Ann-Sofie Nordh: Okay.And then we'll take the next question from Sean at HSBC.Your line should be open.

Sean McLoughlin: Yes.Good morning.Thank you.A question around process automation.You make a very interesting point on your competitive advantage of being the only supplier with direct access to electrification and motion.Are you seeing that already as part of the existing strength in process automation orders?

Is this something that will be, let's say, something that you push much harder on going forward?And you've also highlighted the marine side of things.Just wondering if there's any regional focus of where you see particular order strength there.Thank you.
