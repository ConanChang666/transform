Morten Wierod: Well, yes, this is, I have to say, it's been a trend that has been ongoing for quite a few years now, because with the risk of tariffs being one, but also I think the importance of being closer to customers is just a trend that has been more and more important.So we have done it as ABB, but I know we're not the only company in the world that has moved production closer to customers.And I think that was a bit of a learning after the whole COVID shutdown in the beginning of 2021.So I think this is just the trend what we're seeing.And we do say that's what we are helping also our customers when they are building up more of their local manufacturing.I think that's the important, but I can also use an example that we had even from China, which just shows this where in the electric vehicle space, when some of the leading electric vehicle companies go outside China and set up new manufacturing, that being Indonesia, that being in Thailand or here in Europe, then we are also following customers abroad.

That's why it's important to have this global presence.But then you can also travel with the customers out when they establish new production so that what we've done in China or what we've done in Europe or in the U.S., when they go out to a new region, then we can bring that technology and the know-how from their original design and also do a kind of copy-paste outside.So there is where some really good wins also in this quarter in that space, not just in the U.S., but even going out of China, becoming more local in Asia or in Europe, in the automotive industry as one example.And we don't see it only there, but also in other industries.So this importance of being truly global, but acting local and having service, having people on the ground that can support, it's one of the key elements why our customers choose to work with us on large projects.Eric Lemarie: Okay, thank you.

But do you think the Trump administration policy could accelerate that trend in the U.S.?Morten Wierod: Yes, I mean, there will be more investments in local manufacturing in the United States.That is clear.So I think the flip side here, as Timo mentioned, is kind of the question mark, how will it affect the global economy?But of course, it will drive some more investments in the United States in manufacturing.That's clear.

But how effective it will have on the global economy is for me more the question mark, but that it will drive some more investments in the United States.That's clear.Eric Lemarie: Understood.Thank you.Ann-Sofie Nordh: Thank you.And time flies when you're having fun.

We're going to have to make that our last question.Thank you very much for joining us today.And have a lovely spring break if you're getting one.I'll see you soon.
