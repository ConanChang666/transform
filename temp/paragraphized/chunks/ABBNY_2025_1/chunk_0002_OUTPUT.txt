Morten Wierod: Thanks, Ansi, and a warm welcome also from my side.I would say that we had a strong start to the year.The team did a good job at staying focused in what has been a quarter with intense news flow.I would guess that we all have had tariffs on our radar screens, but if I was to pick up a few highlights from the quarter, those would be, first of all, market activity was high, and it was good to see that demand was strong throughout the quarter with a good finish in March.In total, we increased comparable orders by 5% from last year.

Secondly, we beat our own expectation for operational EBITDA margin in all business areas.On top of this, our margin got an extra boost from a one-timer, which contributed 170 basis points to the margin of 20.2%.The third point I want to mention is the free cash flow of $652 million.This is good for a first quarter, which usually is a softer period for our cash generation.And it puts us now in a good position to improve our annual free cash flow from the $3.9 billion we generated last year.We also made good progress towards our sustainability targets.

My final point is that we continue to be active with the business portfolio.In early March, the team in Smart Building closed the acquisition of the Siemens Wiring Accessory business in China.This adds to our already strong product portfolio.And importantly, it gives us additional market reach through a distribution network across 230 cities.The deal adds about $150 million in sales and it is margin accretive.Today, we also announced our plan to spin off the Robotics division as a separately listed company.

In overview, this change will support value creation for both companies.And as Ansi mentioned already, we will cover this separately later on.As part of the annual reporting suite, we published our sustainability statement.And we made good progress in 2024.We are already close to fulfilling our 2030 targets for 80% reduction of CO2 emissions.At the end of 2024, we were down 78% from the 2019 base level.

But it's not only about us.I'm proud to say that with our technology we helped our customers avoid 66 megatons of emissions with our product sold in 2024.Over the last three years we have accumulated nearly 205 megatons of avoided customer emissions.I also want to mention safety as this is something we cover in all our internal reviews.Keeping our people safe is an important KPI that we follow carefully.Zero incidence is always the target and it's good to see that we continue to track on a low score and we achieved 0.15 for 2024.

So let's take a look at the market developments and the short version is that orders were stable or up in most of our customer segments.Like I mentioned, comparable orders were up by 5%.This was driven by mid-single digit growth in our short cycle orders, which improved in all business areas.We also had 11% growth in the service business, but we had a slightly lower contribution from large orders.Some of the stronger areas were utilities, marine, ports, commercial buildings and most of the process related areas, although chemicals and pulp and paper are generally more muted segments.Our robotics business had increased orders from the automotive segment and our paint technology is the best on the market and we had customers choosing to remain with us as they expanded their international footprint.

One can say we travel with the customer.Data center is usually a focus topic and there has been quite some news flow in Q1.The general sentiment remains very strong.We see some customers even accelerating their investments, even if some slower activity from one of the hyperscalers is noted in this quarter.Rail remains a strong area.One example from our traction business is the collaboration with Stadler in the U.S. We will supply converters and pro-series batteries for train sets in Illinois and California as the U.S. moves towards greener rail transport.

But even if the market is strong, orders in rail dropped from a high large order comparable.Switching to the revenue chart, the $7.9 billion and 3% comparable growth was a bit below our original expectation.We did not convert the backlog or recent short cycle orders as quickly as expected.Volumes were the larger driver to growth with some added contribution from positive pricing.Turning to look at the different geographies, we were actually up in all three regions.The Americas with good support from the U.S. was again the main growth engine and increased by 11%.

Asia, Middle East, Africa improved by 4% and China turned to positive order growth after 10 quarters in decline.All business areas contributed to the China growth of 13% and Europe was up 1% with a mixed picture between the countries.Looking at our large markets, Germany declined while for example Italy improved.Uncertainty triggered by the tariff news load has put focus on footprint and operational setup between regions.I've said to our teams to continue to focus on what we can control and take action to defend our market position and profitability.We have been successful in this area before.

Our legacy of a local for local footprint serves us well.In the United States we cover as much as 75 to 80% of our sales with local production and we invest to increase this number.In Europe and China, we have already reached an even higher local value chain.So I feel we are in a relatively good situation when it comes to local for local.

In addition, we'd also benefit from an exemption such as the U.S. MCA.Turning to earnings, the chart shows that we continue the upward trend for both absolute operational EBITDA and margin.I said that I wanted us to become a plus 40% gross margin company and that is what we delivered in Q1 when gross margin improved by 280 basis points to 41.7%.Admittedly there was about 110 basis point of improvement coming from FX and commodity timing differences.But we have shown we can reach the 40% level and now we have to work towards consistency.The team did a good job also on operational EBITDA.

Margin improved in three out of our four business areas.Only robotics and discrete automation declined from last year.But importantly they showed a positive sequential development and the machine automation division improved to a break-even level.On top of the improved business performance, we had support from a property sale we completed here in Zurich which added about $140 million.This was booked in corporate and other and supported the margin by about 170 basis points to the total of 20.2%.Even without this one timer, it has a good start to the year.

And it sets us up to deliver on our guidance to improve margin from last year, assuming no significant changes in the global economy.And now I hand it over to you, Timo.
