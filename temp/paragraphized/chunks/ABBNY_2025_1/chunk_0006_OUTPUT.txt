Morten Wierod: No we did not see that in the first quarter that people were pre-buying.I think that is just due to the uncertainty of what kind of would you buy to be able to mitigate.So no, we have not seen that.Ann‑Soﬁe Nordh: Very good.

Then we go back to the conference call and we open up the line for Martin at Citi.Martin?Martin Wilkie: Yes, thank you.Good morning it's Martin.Yes, thank you.Morning it's Martin.

Can I ask on the order pipeline it seems no immediate impact on tariffs and orders so far?But when you are talking to customers about the pipeline for the remainder of the year are customers worried about the environment and seeing the potential for significant pauses on decisions for the year ahead and then perhaps you know which industries are more worried around that.And linked to it you've already talked about some capacity expansion in the U.S. Is that primarily demand driven or is it more to give you further hedging against tariffs as well?Thank you.Morten Wierod: Thanks Martin.The order pipeline when we're looking at the -- it's still strong when it comes to the overall and the long term need for electrification and automation that is clearly there.

You see some of the decision making as you remember -- as we mentioned may take and we saw that already in the first quarter that it takes a bit -- may take a bit longer time to get that final decision.We've win and we get the order but sometimes you take another round maybe with the Board for major investments.What we see is that the no regret moves they are being taken.That's the same on our side and others where there is much bigger uncertainty days or where you take another extra round and may discuss.So that's the how I mean uncertainty is not good for decision making.That's clear.

So that's the -- but we are taking this uncertainty into account when we also make our forecast for the second quarter and year end.So it's something we believe we have under control and I'm not kind of worried about it but it will take a bit more for sales work also to get the papers signed.And I think the second point maybe help me here Ansi.Ann‑Soﬁe Nordh: Capacity increases in the U.S. Demand driven or tariff driven?Morten Wierod: Yes.Thank you.

It is driven very much by a demand driven because we don't have -- many of these investments is driven by it's kind of products that has special U.S. or what we call NEMA North America standard.And therefore we need more capacity because the demand has over time been bigger -- been larger than supply.So we are expanding because we see also a long term that goes with the two announcements we had in the education business in San Antonio Mississippi and Selmer in Tennessee is about $120 million.We're expanding those two facilities for low voltage bus bars and for low voltage circuit breakers that is used by utilities that's used in industry and in data centers.So that goes into that general capacity build up.And of course there will not be U.S. tariffs on it when it's produced in U.S. but that's not the primarily driver of it.

Ann‑Soﬁe Nordh: Very good.Thanks Martin.We've had a couple of questions come through here online regarding the portfolio change announcement.So basically the question is why now?Morten Wierod: Yes, we believe the robotics business is now ready to stand on its own two feet.The synergies with the rest of ABB is limited when you look at technology and customers.

Their electrification, motion and process automation very much have common, much more common technology, common go-to-market, common customer base and even common competitors.So we believe this is a good value creation opportunity both for ABB and also for the ABB robotics division being a separately listed company.So therefore it will take a bit of time, we know we said that in Q2, so a year, good year from now is when we can do the listing as there are some internal work on the carve out and the preparation to be done.So therefore we need that time but I believe now it's a good timing because the robotics business is among the very best in their class and being measured against peers.You will also see that and I think then they don't need to fight for capital inside ABB but have now access also for investor in the market.You have now an opportunity to get a hundred cent on the dollar on robotics investment as was not the case at ABB where it's about 7% of revenue and 5% of over earnings.

So that's where we believe that the timing and the team is ready to stand on its own feet that it's a long-term good business in automation and robotics.
