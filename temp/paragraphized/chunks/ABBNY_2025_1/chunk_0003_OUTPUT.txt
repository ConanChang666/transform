Timo Ihamuotila: Thank you, Morten.And welcome to you all from my side as well.Let's now talk through the different business areas, starting with electrification.And the EL team keeps delivering new records.In Q1, they achieved a new all-time high orders of $4.4 billion.This is up 2 % on a comparable basis from the previous high, a testament to strong underlying markets.

Customer activity was stable to positive in most customer segments.This includes our two largest segments of utilities and buildings.Demand in buildings continues to be driven by the commercial market outside of China.And the residential market was overall stable, although the China market is still weak.Morten talked about the data center segment earlier, and the slower activity we saw from one of the hyperscalers.I want to emphasize that outside of this specific event, we still see a very strong data center market.

If we exclude this one hyperscaler, orders in data centers increased at mid‑teen space.The base is now quite sizable, as we had data center orders of about $2.5 billion last year.So generally, it is still a very strong general environment in this tech segment.Turning now to revenues, electrification delivered 6 % comparable growth with contribution from virtually all divisions.Volumes were driven by conversion of the order backlog related to medium voltage and power protection, and also the short cycle business improved by mid‑single digit.The profit chart on the right side shows the steady improvement trend electrification has achieved.

At this quarter was no exception.Operational EBITDA was up by 7 % to $886 million, with a margin of 23.2 %.The gains from higher volumes and operational efficiencies more than offset higher expenses mainly related to SG&A.All in all, a very strong quarter for electrification, adding to our confidence for the year.Now looking into the second quarter, we currently expect low double‑digit growth, in comparable revenues, and the operational EBITDA margin to improve slightly from last year.Now turning to Motion, which delivered another quarter with order intake above $2 billion.

That said, lower large order bookings, mainly in traction division, triggered a decline from last year's record high level.The strongest growth was noted in the service division, while the short cycle improved slightly versus the prior year.We saw favorable order development in HVAC for commercial buildings, as well as in power generation.The softer areas included the process related segments of oil and gas, chemicals, and food and beverage.Rail also declined, but this was linked to the larger order comparable I just mentioned.Shifting now to revenues, which was supported by both higher volumes and a positive price impact.

The long cycle divisions improved as they executed on their high order backlogs, even if this was slightly below our original expectation.This improvement was partly offset by a decline in the service division, while the short cycle areas were broadly stable.In total, this sums up to an increase of 3 % in comparable revenues to just over $1.8 billion.The positive price development, coupled with continued operational improvements, contributed to a strong margin improvement of 110 basis points to 19.6 %.And most divisions improved their profitability year on year.For the second quarter, we anticipate comparable revenue growth in the mid‑single‑digit range and the operational EBITDA margin to remain broadly stable year on year.

In process automation, we saw a continued healthy market environment, and orders came in at the high level of $2 billion, increasing 23 % year on year.The BA team delivered yet another quarter with a positive book‑to‑bill, at this time 1.24 and the backlog is now $8.1 billion.The marine and port segment continues to be growth driver.In this segment we are mainly exposed to passenger vessels like cruise and specialized vessels which could for example include icebreakers or coast guard.Port automation also continued to see strong underlying demand.As for the other segments, we saw a stable to positive order development in most of the energy and process related industries.

The business climate however remains more muted in chemical, pulp and paper and mining.Revenues got off to a good start and increased by 5 % on a comparable basis.The team executed on their steadily increasing order backlog with added support from pricing.The team has done a really good job on quality of revenues as the order backlog gross margin has been increasing.As they now execute on this backlog we see this supporting profitability in the business area.The contribution from the backlog more than offset the impact from lower volumes in the product division.

All in all, it resulted to a new record operational EBITDA margin of 15.8 % improving 20 basis points year on year.Looking at our expectation for the second quarter.We foresee comparable revenues to improve in the mid‑single digit range and the operational EBITDA margin to be stable or slightly up year on year.If we flip now to robotics and discrete automation, it was good to see that this time both divisions contributed to the strong order growth of 17 %.The robotics division saw positive order developments in the automotive and consumer electronic sectors.Both of these important segments remain generally challenging but we were able to grow orders as customers stick with our leading technology as they expand their geographical exposure.

Other positive segments included food and beverage, the fashion industry as well as industrial machinery.In machine automation orders increased sharply from last year's low level.Inventory levels at our customers are normalizing but we will have some inventory adjustments spilling over into the second quarter.But we still expect orders to continue to slightly improve sequentially.Moving now to revenues.The robotics division reported a mid‑single digit growth rate driven by higher volumes from the book and bill business.

This was however clearly offset by significantly lower volumes in machine automation.In total this resulted in comparable revenues being down 11 % year on year.Although the profitability was down sharply year on year due to the lower production volumes in machine automation the sequential improvement was better than anticipated.The previously announced cost savings measures in measurement in machine automation helped improve the margin and this business is now back at breakeven level.The robotics division increased margin from last year supported by higher volumes and efficiency measures.It remains well into the double digit territory.

Combined this resulted in an operational EBITDA margin of 9.9 % down 330 basis points year on year but up 200 basis points sequentially.For RA in the second quarter we expect a slight sequential increase in absolute revenues and operational EBITDA.Now let's move on to the cash flow.All business areas had a positive operating cash flow.It was supported by strong earnings which offset the typical buildup of networking capital in the first quarter.The $652 million of free cash flow was in my view very good for a first quarter.

The year on year increase of $101 million was mainly driven by the real estate sale.The improved operational performance was mostly offset by higher payments related to taxes and interest.Networking capital remained broadly stable.I think the first quarter puts us on a good path to improve our annual free cash flow from last year's $3.9 billion.The last time we met we mentioned some reporting changes including return on capital employed.We now report group ROCE on quarterly basis and it remains a focus area for us.

The chart here shows that the strong trend continued in the first quarter.ROCE reached 23 % and improved 250 basis points from last year.The increase was driven by three out of four business areas as a result of higher earnings, the positive one‑timer and focused networking capital management.And with that, I hand it back to you, Morten.
