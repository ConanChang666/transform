**Morten Wierod:** I can start on the on the last part of that question.Again, giving you an example from the electrification business, where the portfolio is so wide, it is very difficult to have a full production in everywhere in the world.And some of the, what you know, there are different standards between the U.S., what we call the NEMA standards, and in Europe and the rest of the world, there's IAC.And there is to use some of these IAC products that is produced in Europe by all companies, which goes into, for instance, into a machine building or a project built in the U.S. that is re-exported or exported outside the United States.So this accounts for some of those products that is not produced in the United States.And we don't see, I also don't think, or I know that anyone, nobody is really producing those components in the United States.

And therefore, it will come as a price change in the market.Because for most of these cases, there is no local alternative available. **Timo Ihamuotila:** Yes, and on the trading, I think we can only say there that we have not seen anything kind of like in the trading sort of these months, which would sort of fundamentally change any view, any customer behavior or anything like that.But I think we need to leave it at that. **James Moore:** Thank you very much. **Ann‑Sofie Nordh:** Thanks, James.And then we open up the line for Daniela at Goldman Sachs. **Daniela Costa:** Hi, good morning.Thank you so much for taking my question.I just wanted to ask regarding low voltage and supply and demand in the market, your adding capacity.

We also see a lot of your peers adding capacity.Just maybe if you could give some color on that, especially like where are lead times, what's the sort of visibility that is there, especially if we go into a slightly softer U.S. macro part of these products, our short cycle, but just to give us a picture of how the supply demand is? **Morten Wierod:** As you said, the increased, the expansion of our facilities is to meet that extended or the expanded amount that we see in the market.And again, also to limit the number of imports, what comes from outside, because that's why we also take some of the components that comes from Europe today is because we don't have enough capacity in the United States.So I see there is still much longer lead time than the industry was used to.So we still have work to do there to get it further down.I don't see any short term or midterm kind of overcapacity or issues in the market.

It is the whole the trend of electrification, even if there is the global economy goes a bit slower, nobody is immune.But I see that the electrification and the automation trend that we are facing, especially and I mentioned in infrastructure, that is not going to change quickly because those CapEx plans are made, those are ongoing projects.And we see that that is desperately needed, especially in the United States, in some of the infrastructure investment.So therefore, I don't have any short or midterm worries when it comes to capacity.It's more, as I say, we are still building capacity at this point of time. **Daniela Costa:** Got it.Thank you. **Ann‑Sofie Nordh:** Thanks, Daniela.

And then we have a question here from Olof at Danske Bank.He says, what impact do you expect from the stimulus package announced in Germany?And when do you expect that to impact, if so? **Morten Wierod:** I mean, overall, it's good that Germany starts also to investing again.It has been a tough situation in Germany for the last two years.And we do see some more optimism on the ground also with large customers.But they're still too early.

There was no impact in the first quarter, and we will not see that in the second quarter either.It is because, you know, from planning, permitting into starting building until the electrification automation is in the ground is so from there, an impact point of view, we are more into the 2026 onwards.But I think it's good to see that there is more an environment of investing again.And I think the mood starts to change.And that is maybe the I think is the first and important part that customers and our partner starts to look at the opportunities and not kind of looking backwards of everything that went wrong, but more of what can we do in the marketplace.And there is a bit more of optimism that will help.

And for us, it's about all those investments in either in infrastructure, you know, getting more affordable, but more reliable energy supplies of Europe and Germany, especially will support the business of ABB.So I think that we are well positioned to take part in that those investments that will come, but a bit still a bit early. **Ann‑Sofie Nordh:** Very good.We open up the line for Anders at ABG.Are you with us?
