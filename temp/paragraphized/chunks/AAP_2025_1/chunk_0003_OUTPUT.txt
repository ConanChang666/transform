Ryan Grimsland: Thank you, Shane, and good morning, everyone.I would also like to thank the Advance team for their commitment to serving our customers while continuing to make meaningful strides in our turnaround efforts.For the first quarter, net sales from continuing operations were $2.6 billion, a 7% decrease compared to last year.This decline is mainly attributed to the store optimization activity completed in March.Comparable store sales declined 60 basis points during the 16-week period in Q1 and excludes locations closed during the quarter, which generated $51 million in liquidation sales.During Q1, sales started off soft, declining in the low single-digit range in the first 8 weeks.

Demand started to recover in late February, aided by less weather volatility, normalization of tax refunds and consistent positive performance in our Pro business.Initiatives to improve inventory in stocks and service levels for customers led to 8 consecutive weeks of positive Pro comps in the U.S. through the end of the quarter.Separately, Q1 also benefited by the shift in timing of Easter into our fiscal Q2, which we estimate added approximately 20 basis points to comps.In terms of channel performance, Pro grew in the low single-digit range, which is an acceleration compared to Q4 and outperformed the DIY channel, which declined in the low single-digit range.Our Pro comp also accelerated on a 2-year basis and was positive for the third consecutive quarter.Transactions declined in the low single-digit range during Q1, with Pro down only slightly.

Average ticket grew in a low single-digit range and was positive in both channels.From a category perspective, we saw strength in batteries, wipers and fluids and chemicals.Gross profit from continuing operations was $1.11 billion or 42.9% of net sales, resulting in a gross margin contraction of 50 basis points compared to last year.The year-over-year deleverage was largely driven by approximately 90 basis points of margin headwind associated with liquidation sales related to our store optimization activity.During the quarter, gross margin also benefited from favorability on capitalized warehouse costs related to a pull forward of some inventory purchases ahead of tariffs.We estimate this added approximately 80 basis points of margin and is expected to normalize during the year.

Adjusted SG&A from continuing operations was $1.12 billion or 43.2% of net sales, resulting in deleverage of 180 basis points compared to last year.A portion of the deleverage was driven by the comparison to a gain on asset sale from last year.Adjusting for this, SG&A would have deleveraged approximately 110 basis points, mainly due to higher labor-related expenses.As a result, adjusted operating loss from continuing operations came in at $8 million or negative 30 basis points of net sales.A healthier top line performance helped us deliver better-than-expected operating margins with operating losses narrowing significantly compared to last quarter.Adjusted diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.22 compared with earnings per share of $0.33 in the prior year.

On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $0.40 due to a net discrete tax benefit of $126 million associated with capital loss deductions following the Worldpac transaction, which was factored into our forecast for the year.We ended the quarter with negative free cash flow of $198 million compared with negative $49 million in the prior year.Free cash flow includes approximately $90 million of cash expenses associated with the store optimization project and approximately $100 million of additional inventory investments, which was planned for later in the year, to support the accelerated rollout of our store-based assortment framework that Shane referenced earlier.For fiscal 2025, we have reaffirmed the guidance established in February.We remain focused on executing and tracking the progress of our strategic initiatives to develop a strong foundation for the long term.Before discussing items within the guidance, let me provide our perspective on the current tariff environment and how that is influencing our outlook for the year.

We are collaborating with our vendor partners to address the challenges posed by elevated product costs and evaluating each cost driver before accepting any increases from vendors.Our approach to navigating tariffs is expected to be measured as we make tariff-related price adjustments.We'll continually assess inflation and demand elasticity, and we'll monitor competitive response while executing our plan this year.Within the current tariff landscape, we are planning for a range of scenarios and feel strongly about our ability to navigate through the rising cost environment.These scenarios are in alignment with our full year guidance, reinforcing our expectations for the balance of the year.The complexities of the current economic landscape also warrant an appropriate sensitivity to financial flexibility through the turnaround.

We will continue to monitor and assess our debt capital structure with the goal of ensuring maximum financial flexibility for the business.We believe we have the right strategy root in core retail fundamentals to achieve our financial objectives and the benefits of our strategic actions is expected to build steadily over the next 3 years.Next, let's discuss our expectations for this year.Starting with net sales.We expect net sales in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.Comparable sales is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 150 basis points on a 52-week basis.

We expect sequential improvement in comparable sales during 2025 with stronger growth in the second half, supported by our focus on improving parts availability and elevated service levels.For Q2, we currently estimate flattish comparable sales growth, including the impact of the Easter shift from Q1.During the quarter, we will also fully cycle through the $100 million of price investments from last year.Net sales also include contribution from new stores planned to be opened this year, and we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately $100 million to $120 million into net sales.Moving to margins.Adjusted operating income margin is expected in the range of 2% to 3%.

We expect sequential progress in operating margins this year, with Q2 expected to track in line with the full year range and further improvement expected in the second half.Gross margin is expected to be the primary driver of operating margin this year, driven by a combination of product cost savings and supply chain cost leverage with an improvement in sales.We expect SG&A expenses to be down year-over-year with margin in the range of flat to slightly down.SG&A includes the impact of annual wage inflation and other field investments offset by favorability from labor productivity and indirect cost savings.

Additionally, we expect to save approximately $70 million in annual operating costs related to our store and DC optimization activity.These savings will begin in Q2 and contribute to margin favorability for the balance of the year.Moving to the other items and guidance.Adjusted diluted EPS is expected in the range of $1.50 and $2.50.We expect free cash flow in the range of negative $85 million to negative $25 million at the end of the year.Our guidance now includes cash expenses of approximately $150 million associated with store and DC optimization activity, which is below our prior estimate of $200 million, reflecting favorability in lease disposition costs.

This benefit was offset by opportunistic inventory purchases ahead of the tariff implementation earlier this year.In summary, we are pleased with our progress thus far and remain resolute in controlling the aspects of our business within our control while navigating a volatile macro environment.I will now hand the call back to Shane.Thank you.
