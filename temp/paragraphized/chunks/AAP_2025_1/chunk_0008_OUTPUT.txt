Michael Lasser: My follow‑up question, and I apologize for it making -- being very short term in nature, but you're pointing to a flat comp for the second quarter.It sounds like the Pro side continues to perform well or within your expectations, DIY is volatile.Do you need to see an acceleration in the overall business in order to hit that flat for the quarter.And as you think about the back half of the year, are there other drivers to get what would seem to be a low single‑digit overall comp that's embedded in the outlook outside of just lapping some of the price investments and other factors.Ryan Grimsland: Yes.Michael, I'll start and let Shane jump in here.

So our exit rate coming out of P4, we're in line with that into Q2.So we're -- and we're in line with our guidance for the quarter.So that flattish is kind of where we're trending today coming out of P4.So that's where we're at.We don't need to see a change necessary.We need to continue the momentum we've got today.

In the back half from a growth there, one, you see the acceleration in these initiatives.So we've got the DMA work that we're accelerating.You see the market hubs that are going.But also keep in mind, there's some easier comparisons as well.And in Q1 and the Q2, the change in trends or the similar trends, just remember, we're backing out Easter for that.So if you just adjust for that, it was 20 basis points in Q1, it's a 25 basis point headwind in Q2.

Shane O?Kelly: Yes, just let me illustrate with kind of a story around the initiatives, the strategic pillars.And it's a turnaround, and we're going down the long road to get this company back on footing.I was in a DC with our DC leader, Steve Szilagyi and we look at a vendor that has shipped us individual piece parts, and these are small little containers where it costs more to put the container away than what the value of the product is.So Steve goes to the vendor that says, "Hey, why are you shipping us like this." And the vendor says, "Well, why are you cutting POs like that?" And so together, we sit down the table and we say, "Hey, if you could send me fewer bigger POs with the right frequency, I can put together bigger orders for you." By the way, we could start doing case‑pack quantities instead of one [each], and that's 7‑digit cost takeout.And by the way, we're going sequentially across our vendor base having those discussions.Now you can't do that overnight, when you start to change pick quantities and things like that.

But that's just one example of what's going on in supply chain to create lines for hour.By the way, simultaneously, we're closing DCs.Simultaneously, we're opening market hubs.Simultaneously, we're refreshing the assortment in the DMA.So there's a lot of activity going on in the company that it's a little bit of a yard at a time that that's what we have as we think about going into the back half of the year.And by the way, into '26 and into '27.

Operator: The next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo.Zachary Fadem: Good morning.Now that the store optimization is largely behind us.Can you walk us through your expectations for non‑GAAP adjustments for the rest of the year?It looks like about $100 million on SG&A this quarter.So as you look ahead, is there any color you can give on GAAP versus non‑GAAP operating margins and EPS expectations for '25.

Ryan Grimsland: We're not guiding necessarily GAAP.But I think in Q1, we had the benefit of the tax piece that happened in Q1 from a GAAP standpoint.But from a cash expense standpoint, we had $150 million this year, $90 million is already done.So hopefully, that's helpful.Zachary Fadem: Okay.And then stepping back on your conversations with vendors, is there a consensus out there on where like‑for‑like inflation will shake out for the industry this year, both tariff and nontariff driven?

And then separately, we've talked in the past about opportunities to renegotiate maybe take some vendors off supplier financing, and that could result in some margin improvement for you.Any update there?Shane O?Kelly: I'll just start on the first part.There's lots of scenarios on how it plays out with the vendors.I would just go back to the previously related perspective.We've gone through -- we're going through our mitigation strategies.

In some cases, collectively, we don't know what the ending outcome is.It's a rational industry.We'll look to act rationally, hold rate.We can't hold rate, manage operating profit in terms of what our approach looks like.So that's the first part.
