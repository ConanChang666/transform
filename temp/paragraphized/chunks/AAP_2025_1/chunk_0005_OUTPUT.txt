<think> Okay, I need to convert this verbatim transcript into a paragraph format without deleting or altering any of the original content.Let me read through the first part again.The user provided a transcript with multiple speakers and their utterances.The main goal is to keep all the sentences as they are but arrange them into coherent paragraphs.Starting with Shane O’Kelly's first statement.He's talking about reaffirming guidance, mentioning puts and takes, scenarios with tariffs and consumer volatility.

Then the operator introduces Seth Sigman's question.Seth is asking about the comp improvement, the role of store closures, sales transfer to remaining stores, especially on the Pro side.Next, Ryan Grimsland answers Seth.He breaks down the comp difference between closing stores and remaining ones, mentions that it wasn't material, talks about lower base and profitability.

Then he discusses the sales transfer in Pro, praising the team.He also brings up factors like weather, tax refunds, tax pressure, and initiatives in Pro and time to serve.Shane then adds context about the process, mentioning teams and the uncertainty created.He emphasizes moving back to strategic pillars and growth.Seth continues by asking about guidance related to tariffs and pricing.Shane and Ryan then explain the tariff situation—volatility, types of tariffs (301, 232, AEPA), blended rate of 30%, 40% of sourced products affected.

They mention subcomponents and mitigation strategies.I need to group these utterances into paragraphs based on each speaker's contributions.For example, all of Shane O’Kelly's statements should form his paragraphs, Ryan’s responses his own, etc. Ensure that each speaker's name is placed at the start of their paragraph.Also, maintain the exact wording and order of the sentences as provided.Check for any speaker overlaps or interjections.Seth's question is followed by Ryan's answer, then Shane's addition.

Then Seth's next question and Shane/Ryan's response.Group each speaker's lines together.Make sure not to merge different speakers into one paragraph.Keep the quotes intact and in the correct sequence.Avoid any paraphrasing or summarization, just reformat into paragraphs.Also, verify that all the original sentences are included and that the structure flows logically.

Use proper punctuation and capitalization at the beginning of each paragraph.Ensure that the operator's line is included as a separate paragraph.Watch for any markdown in the original transcript and replace with standard punctuation.Make sure the speaker names are correctly attributed and bold if necessary. </think> **Shane O?Kelly:** Just to add that there's a series of puts and takes that goes into how we came to reaffirming the guidance.Ryan described some of them there, know that we've run the scenarios and what the tariffs might look like, what that volatility might look like with consumers and the concatenation of that left us to put guide where it is and keep it there. **Operator:** Next question comes from Seth Sigman from Barclays. **Seth Sigman:** Sounds like progress in a lot of areas.I'm trying to figure out with the improvement in comps this quarter, how much of that was from closing stores that were previously dragging on the comps?

Maybe you could give us a sense of how much those stores were under comping previously, so we could try to understand the dynamics there.And then as we think about the closings this quarter, I assume there is some sales transfer to the remaining stores, particularly on the Pro side of the business.So if you could help quantify some of that would be great. **Ryan Grimsland:** Absolutely.So back to the first part was the mix of maybe the closing stores.So the comp difference between those closing stores and the remaining stores wasn't material.I think we had talked about that in the past.

It was just a lower base and the profitability of those.So they could comp on a lower base sales volume, especially out West.So it didn't really have much of an impact materially on the comp mix.So I wouldn't say that, that was a driver of the comp performance in the quarter.We did see some transfer sales, mainly in the Pro area, and that was planned and expected, and we achieved what we expected.We were really happy with that.

I have to give a shout out to the Pro team who worked diligently to transfer those Pro accounts to the new stores, and they did a very good job doing that.So there's some in there, not quantifying that, but there's some in the Pro trend.We really like to see, I think the comp difference in what we expected was really the first 8 weeks, the weather volatility, the tax refunds, trying to understand -- is there pressure on the consumer that's different -- we saw that bounce back in the final 8 weeks of that quarter.We saw that normalize and some of the initiatives we had around Pro and improved time to serve coming out of our stores, I think, really had an impact as well. **Shane O?Kelly:** Just -- and thanks for the question, Seth.Just some contextual flavor to that coming through that process as quickly as we did, there were a number of teams. We talked about supply chain in the prepared remarks, our stores team led by Jason Hand, our real estate team, Todd Davenport.These guys getting that done as quickly as we did.

There's a secondary effect when you're going through these processes.It creates uncertainty in your organization when you're doing it.And by the way, as you think about how customers think about what your longer-term trajectory looks like.So for us being done with it, and now moving our narrative back to focusing on our strategic pillars, back to creating value, back to growth, that's where we're moving the company now.And so we've come through that and now driving forward on strategy for the remainder of the year. **Seth Sigman:** Okay.Great.

That's very helpful.And then I did want to ask about the guidance, specifically as it relates to tariffs.I get that tariffs are manageable in the sector.What have you embedded here?How does it impact your P&L as we move through the year?And how are you thinking about pricing? **Shane O?Kelly:** Yes.

No, great question.I'll start and Ryan can add to it.So for tariffs, it's a volatile situation.And think about tariffs as you got the 301s, the 232s, AEPA and tariff creates variability by product, country of origin, tariff magnitude, by the way, changes to any of the above, the stackability of a tariff, whether it's discrete or combined with others.And so as we've looked at that, in aggregate across the company, our blended tariff rate with currently in effect is about 30%.And if you think about the applicability to products, about 40% of what we source can have some applicability to tariff.

Now some of it might be a subcomponent in the goods.So before you just take the 30% times the 40% to say that's the economic impact, know that there's subcomponentry there.But importantly, before just moving forward with that math, we've done mitigation strategies broadly across a number of dimensions.And maybe, Ryan, touch on the mitigation.
