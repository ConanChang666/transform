Shane O’Kelly: Thank you, Ryan.Before closing today's call, I would like to thank all our team members who are listening on the call today.I am incredibly proud of your efforts this quarter.Our team not only managed to deliver results that exceeded expectations, but also completed the store footprint optimization within an accelerated time line while driving progress on our strategic priorities.Thank you.With that, let's open the call for questions.

Operator?Operator: [Operator Instructions].And our first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.Simeon Gutman: Maybe my first question, if you think about the 0.5% to 1.5% comp, you have an implicit mix of DIY versus DIFM performance within that.I don't think you've shared that with us.But can you tell us now that the first quarter is in the bag?

Can you tell us what that expectation, how it's changed?Do you have any difference in how you think the year will play out based on how it's performing so far?And then I have one follow-up.Ryan Grimsland: Yes.Simeon, this is Ryan.I'll jump in here real quick.

So far, it's played out similar to what we expect.We haven't seen any change in trend on DIY and our expectations.But what we have stated is that we expect DIFM to be the driver of our performance.The DIY will still be somewhat pressured.I think it's still early in this tariff environment to really understand if that will change going forward, though we did model out different scenarios that are reflected in our range of guidance.But as of right now, we expect the trends to -- our guidance expects the trends to continue where DIFM will lead and DIY will still be slightly pressured.

Shane O’Kelly: Simeon, Shane here.Let me build on that.So you've seen the Pro trend, 12 weeks positive comp DIY, I think the volatility of the situation, and you see that in consumer sentiment, some of the credit card data, default rates suggest there could be some difficulties for the consumer, although we're controlling what we could control, and we are putting effort against making sure we're relevant for the DIY customer.That includes the availability efforts, that includes awareness around our marketing campaign, promotions, fewer, bigger, better, leveraging our loyalty program.We have 16 million Speed Perks members, training for the stores in terms of how to present products and [greet].So we'll look to do things to make sure we're participating with DIY customers.

Simeon Gutman: And the follow-up, if we take the full year guidance and look at the complexion with gross margin and SG&A.The first quarter was better on gross.It looks like you're going to have some tailwinds because the liquidation goes away.You talked, Shane, about the product cost that should improve throughout the year.It feels like that was built into the way you built your outlook, I think.And -- but can you talk about is there more upward pressure than you thought.

And then on SG&A, even with some of the cost removal, it doesn't look like there's a lot of upside to the SG&A forecast.Can you just -- I don't know -- I know you're not changing guidance, and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but it feels like the guidance range still looks relatively appropriate even with some of the upside drivers.It looks like you've kind of captured that in the guidance for the rest of the year.If you can comment on that, please.Ryan Grimsland: Yes, Simeon.Yes, the big driver still remains the same is that our driver of operating income will mainly be driven by gross profit growth and especially in the back half of the year.

And as Shane said earlier, seeing 50 basis points already annualized on that cost out, that's a big one.We've got the headwinds of -- in margins specifically that there are now tailwinds, but headwinds we faced last year in the back half of the year was about 170 basis points.So if you think about that build on our OI and then there was about 30 in SG&A. .SG&A is going to be down year-over-year, especially with the store closures, pulling those out and then the work that the stores team is doing on productivity, we'll see that.We're also going to see on supply chain with the work the team is doing there, we're going to be able to leverage on the sales volume.So as Shane talked about the, lines power, the productivity supply chain is driving, that's going to allow us to leverage on the sales increase that we'll see in the back half of the year.

So -- but the big bulk of the growth is going to be on gross margin back half of the year, and we like what our merchant team is doing, led by Bruce on our cost out and working with our vendor partners, we like what we're seeing there.
