Shane O?Kelly: Thank you, Lavesh, and good morning, everyone.I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for the hard work, unwavering commitment and dedication of the Advance team.I am pleased to report that our team delivered better-than-expected first quarter results.After a challenging start to the year for the industry, we began to see demand rebound in late February led by our Pro business.For the quarter, Pro grew in the low single-digit range, including 8 consecutive weeks of positive comparable sales growth in the U.S. This positive momentum in Pro has continued during the first 4 weeks of Q2, driven by our focus on providing exceptional customer service.

In addition to better-than-expected top line results, we also reported stronger profitability with near breakeven adjusted operating margin, and we're on track to deliver positive operating margins starting with Q2.Based on our performance to date and expected progress on our initiatives for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year 2025 guidance.Ryan will provide additional details later, and I want to note that our guidance also considers the impacts of tariffs currently in effect along with our planned mitigation strategies.We believe the combination of an aging and growing vehicle fleet in the U.S., coupled with the relatively nondiscretionary nature of auto part spending puts Advance and the industry in a favorable position to navigate through a volatile environment.We participate in a disciplined industry that has always operated rationally, and we would expect that to continue.In March, we reached a significant strategic milestone with the completion of our store footprint optimization program.

Approximately 75% of our store footprint is now concentrated in markets where we hold the #1 or #2 position based on store density.We have also embarked on an ambitious new phase of store expansion aimed at further strengthening our presence in these regions to capture share in the more than $150â€¯billion total addressable market.Over the next 3 years, we expect to open more than 100 new stores with plans to further accelerate that pace of growth in the future.Our team is focused on implementing initiatives across the strategic pillars of merchandising, supply chain and stores to drive improvements in operational performance.These efforts are designed to strengthen our operational capabilities while building a robust foundation to deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth and enhanced value for our shareholders.

Next, I will provide an update on each strategic pillar.Let's begin with merchandising.The team has made good progress in expanding parts availability and securing quality products at a competitive cost.Last quarter, we piloted a new assortment framework in a single designated market area, or DMA to improve parts coverage at the store level.We created a top-down assortment plan for each store, hub and market hub in this DMA, which led to the rebalancing of hundreds of SKUs to align the inventory to market specific needs.The new framework is enabling us to increase coverage in prominent hard parts categories, many of which are frequently in demand by our Pro customers.

During Q1, we expanded this framework to 10 additional DMAs.And in the first 9 weeks following the rollout, we have observed an estimated uplift of nearly 50 basis points in comparable sales growth within these DMAs.Encouragingly, we are observing increased sales in categories where additional SKUs have been introduced, while sales in categories with reduced SKUs have remained relatively stable.Looking ahead, we anticipate gradual improvement in sales as increased parts availability translates into higher transaction volume.Feedback from stores has also been positive, which has motivated us to accelerate this program.With our recent learnings, we are expediting the implementation and are now using technology to automate key processes.

As a result, we plan to complete the rollout in the top 50 DMAs by the end of 2025 with 30 of the 50 markets expected to be live by August.This is faster than our prior 12- to 18-month time line, which stretched into 2026.While this new assortment framework enables us to align SKUs to market requirements, we are also prioritizing the improvement of SKU depth across all stores.We are measuring this through our store availability KPI, which is now in the mid-90 percentage range.Notably, this KPI improved by approximately 200 basis points sequentially and compares to the low 90% range recorded last year.Strong coverage depth is enabling our store teams to sell complete assortment bundles and full application job quantities, which is critical for our customers and helps create repeatable Pro business.

Advance is a leading player in the industry with a 93-year legacy and a growing store footprint that currently spans more than 4,000 stores, having the right part at the right place in our network gives us the opportunity to capture our fair share of the market.Next, let's turn to product costs.As we have indicated previously, the gap in merchandise margin is among the largest drivers of our operating margin gap compared to the industry.Over the last year, our team has partnered with vendors to conduct line reviews with the goal of securing high-quality products at a competitive cost.This work is expected to continue through mid-2025 and based on our progress thus far, we have visibility to greater than 50 basis points of annualized cost reductions that will start to flow in the second half of the year.We will continue to pursue further cost reduction efforts while also investing time to develop strategic business plans with our vendors to drive mutual revenue growth.

Our customer-first approach and disciplined execution on core retail fundamentals continues to resonate with our vendor partners, giving us optimism in our ability to deliver additional future value.Next, supply chain.I want to start by acknowledging the tremendous effort of the supply chain team during Q1.This team played an integral role in successfully completing our asset optimization activity despite the complexities involved in the execution.Their work included relocating hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory across the network, rerouting replenishment routes to align with our revised store and DC footprint and supporting the merchandising team to launch the new assortment framework in 10 markets.Importantly, they achieved this while maintaining high safety standards and smooth day-to-day operations.

Having participated in multiple supply chain transformations in my career, I can attest that the team's accomplishments were no small feat.We are on track to close 12 distribution centers this year with 6 completed to date.We expect to end the year with 16 DCs, making our way towards the goal of operating 12 large DCs by the end of 2026 with each averaging approximately 500,000 square feet.As we complete the consolidation of these DCs, flow higher volume and optimize our inbound and outbound processes, we expect to drive incremental labor productivity.We measure this with product lines per hour, which improved in the low single-digit percentage range during Q1 compared to last year.We are targeting continuous improvement in this metric through the development of fresh operational standards for our DCs.

For example, since we started moving more volume through our large DCs, we are evaluating daily workflows such as measuring the time to pick a part and comparing that against benchmarks to determine where our process needs to evolve.Ultimately, we are building a foundation to efficiently support over 4,000 stores through 12 large-sized DCs operating on a single warehouse system versus the previous model of 38 DCs of varying sizes with disparate systems. To do this successfully, we are investing resources to upgrade our operational standards to improve productivity.In conjunction with consolidating DCs, we plan to drive cost efficiency by optimizing both the routing of replenishment orders from DCs and the movement of products between hubs and stores.To achieve this, we plan to implement a new routing framework in stages throughout this year.We anticipate that the combination of improved DC labor productivity and optimized routing will begin delivering cost savings by late 2025 with a larger benefit accruing later.In May, we entered a pivotal phase in the development of our multi-echelon supply network with the opening of 2 greenfield market hubs in the Midwest.

We now operate 21 market hubs and continue to target 10 market hub openings this year while simultaneously building the pipeline for 2026 and 2027.We remain committed to our goal of establishing 60 market hubs by mid-2027 to strengthen our competitive position.A market hub with 75,000 to 85,000 SKUs expand same-day parts availability for a service area of about 60 to 90 stores.Based on the aggregate performance of the market hubs in operation through Q1 and the stores being serviced by these hubs, we have observed an estimated comp uplift of nearly 100 basis points in those markets.These results reinforce our confidence in the path forward, which we expect to further improve as the new assortment framework developed by the merchandising team is fully implemented across the market hubs.In our stores, the team is focused on improving service levels to drive repeatable business and gain market share.

The Pro channel led the recovery in comp sales in the second half of Q1.This improvement in the Pro was driven primarily by transaction growth, which we view as a leading indicator of our efforts to move up the call list with Pros.You may recall, early this year, we revamped the compensation and incentive structures for our frontline sales team and equipped them with additional tools and resources to better serve customers.We are seeing the results of these investments in the Pro channel, which makes us optimistic about the opportunity to capture additional wallet share of the Pro.Our store team is focused on exceptional customer service and was able to shave off approximately 10 minutes in delivery time compared to last year.This reduction is being achieved through a combination of training enhancements, better in-stocks and increased accountability in the field.

Our goal is to consistently deliver parts within 30 to 40 minutes.Ensuring this consistency helps our Pros turn their base faster and elevates Advance's reputation as a dependable and timely provider of parts.We are encouraged by the progress thus far and are confident in the team's ability to deliver on our service commitment.To support this, we are also testing a standardized store operating structure to guide our teams on store labor scheduling and to provide an effective mechanism to allocate resources such as delivery trucks and driver hours.This test is now live in about 10% of our stores.Learnings from this test will inform our view on the standardized structure, which we expect to launch company-wide later this year.

Shifting to DIY.During the second half of Q1, we saw an improvement in DIY trends, although the weekly volatility continues to remain high.Maintenance-related categories such as fluids, chemicals and oil are performing relatively better, suggesting that DIY consumers remain cautious in their overall spending.As we look ahead, we expect the DIY environment to remain challenged due to the potential for higher broad-based consumer goods inflation impacting household budgets.Despite the sales choppiness, we are proactively addressing areas of the business that are within our control.This includes enhanced training programs for our store teams to deepen product knowledge as well as a reallocation of key store roles to better assist customers.

Our efforts to improve the in-store experience are beginning to deliver positive proof points as we are seeing an improvement in units being sold per transaction.This metric has stabilized after declining for most of last year.From a DIY communications perspective, we are also strengthening our brand message through a new marketing campaign with the theme right around the corner and ready to help.This campaign showcases Advance as a leading destination for automotive parts that offers convenient store locations, strong inventory availability, expert advice, free services and high-quality brands.I want to underscore our commitment to advancing the turnaround and ensuring accountability.We are making traction on operational improvements for the business, and I'm optimistic about the opportunities ahead.

Now let me hand the call over to Ryan to discuss our financials.Ryan?
