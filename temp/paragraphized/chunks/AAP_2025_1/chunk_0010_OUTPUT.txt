Shane O?Kelly: Yes.So it's a great question.When I look at the business, I look at what our teams are doing and I look at the initiatives and they say, "Hey, does that make sense?Is that what -- are those fundamentals of auto parts in terms of activities?" And I absolutely see it in the Pro team.And so we go to market with Pro with really two major bodies of effort.The first is our outside sales team.

We have hundreds of men and women who visit our customers every day.And then we have thousands of team members in our stores called commercial parts Pros.If we look at the activities we're taking and that ranges from making sure we've got the incentive and compensation plans right, that looks in terms of how we recruit and put people into those roles that looks to training that we've reinitiated at scale to make sure that they're properly equipped.And then in terms of how we do call planning and who they call on and when they see them, then what do they say when they go see a customer and making sure correspondingly that we've been thoughtful about where relative pricing is for different Pros based on what they buy and how much they buy.So there's a lot of analysis going in.There's investment in our people.

There's energy.We brought our team together for the first time in a decade earlier this year.So that's certainly having an impact in terms of our ability to get business with Pros.And I hear it as well because I'll go out and visit Pros and they'll say, "Hey, you guys are now more relevant to me as I think about making the call, not the least of which, by the way, is the DMA availability work." Pros, when they have a car on the lift and they make the call, it's like, do you have the part we're saying yes more frequently than we were in the past.And then add to the mix, the first question is, do you have it?Yes or no. And second is when can I get it?

We've saved 10 minutes off the delivery time.So those 2 components also make a big difference.So certainly, we're subject to the market forces up and down, but there's internal things that we control, that we're improving that are making us more relevant with Pro customers.Steven Zaccone: Okay.

Then the follow-up I had, just drilling down in the second quarter with comps expected to be flattish.How should we think about the build of transactions versus ticket in that second quarter?Ryan Grimsland: Yes, Stephen, so not necessarily guiding specifically on those, but I would say probably expecting the trends in DIFM to continue.And I think it's still early and volatile.We are monitoring the demand elasticity given this tariff environment and understanding the pushes and pulls there as we move price into the market.So not going to guide to those specifics just given the volatile nature of the current environment with tariffs, but we are confident in what we're putting.

Shane O?Kelly: I just want to say -- thanks for the question.I want to say one other thing on the Pro universe that helps us knew whether or not we're doing the right things.And that's our independent owners.So our independent owners, they will give you raw feedback on how well they think you're doing on different dimensions.And by the way, they basically index entirely towards the Pro universe.And so we're grateful to have them as part of our network.

We think we've got the right number of independents, and they're giving us feedback on how we're doing on our availability in terms of getting products to them.And I talked to one of our independent owners said, "Hey, I've seen a noticeable improvement in my ability to get the parts that ultimately I need to take care of customers." So that's another benchmark that helps us sort of calibrate towards -- are we on the right track for working with Pros.Operator: Our final question today comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim.Steven Forbes: I wanted to expand on the servicing model.I think good.You mentioned in the call, 10% of stores are live with labor scheduling and asset allocation models.

It was one of the few things you didn't comment on sort of what you're seeing in terms of improved performance, right, within those stores that have that model.So I was wondering if you can maybe first and foremost, just expand on sort of what you're doing right in the store, what you're seeing in the store and if you're seeing sort of a visible lift in core KPIs in the back of leaning into that servicing model.
