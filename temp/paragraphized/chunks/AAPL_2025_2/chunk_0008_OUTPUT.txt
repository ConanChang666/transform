Krish Sankar: Yes, hi.Thanks for taking my question.I have two of them, too.Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment.I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that?How much is CapEx versus R&D?

How much is going into like the Texas server?How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona?Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful.And then I had a follow-up.Tim Cook: Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say.We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it.

And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner.We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well.And so it's a bit of all of it.Krish Sankar: Got it, got it.And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question.When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge.

Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle.But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference?Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device?Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here.Tim Cook: Yes.As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today.

And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud.And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT.And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here.We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.Krish Sankar: Thanks, sir.Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish.

Operator, could we get the next question, please?Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.Please go ahead.Richard Kramer: Thank you very much.Wanted to ask about tariffs.Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack?

Or is it a matter of R&D spending?And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC?Thanks.Tim Cook: Yes.If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18.And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on.

And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India.So we've delivered a lot.However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar.And there's not a lot of other reason for it.It's just taking a bit longer than we thought.But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.

Kevan Parekh: And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business.We make significant investments in R&D.That continues to grow.We're continuing to grow our R&D investment.And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map.
