【段落式逐字稿】：。_tim Cook表示：_yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier.。_Ben Reitzes詢問：_All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving?What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions?Thanks.。_Tim Cook回應：_Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there.。

_Ben Reitzes表示：_Thanks a lot, Tim.。_Tim Cook說：_Yes. Thank you, Ben.。_Suhasini Chandramouli說：_Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?。_Operator說：_Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.。_Michael Ng詢問：_Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation?

And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue?Thank you.。_Tim Cook回應：_Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.。_Michael Ng補充詢問：_Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful?Thank you.。_Kevan Parekh表示：_Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange.。
