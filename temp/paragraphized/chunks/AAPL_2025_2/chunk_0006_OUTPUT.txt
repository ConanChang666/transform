**Amit Daryanani:** Thanks a lot.I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well.Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number.Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter?And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially? **Tim Cook:** I wouldn't want to go through all of them.But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful. **Amit Daryanani:** Got it.

And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year?I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half.I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter? **Kevan Parekh:** Yes, Amit.Hi, it's Kevan.So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year.We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially.

However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis.With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today. **Amit Daryanani:** Got it.Thank you. **Kevan Parekh:** Thank you. **Suhasini Chandramouli:** Thanks, Amit.Operator, could we have the next question, please? **Operator:** Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Please go ahead. **Wamsi Mohan:** Yes.Thank you.

Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India?How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up? **Tim Cook:** We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that.And that's the SoC that's coming out of there.We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips.In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states.This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously.

And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted.And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know. **Kevan Parekh:** Yes, maybe I’ll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward.A couple of observations I’d mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well.We’ve made good decisions balancing units revenue margins.When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies.We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product.

And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin.So I hope that’s helpful color and context for you. **Wamsi Mohan:** No, that’s super helpful.Thank you.I guess you just noted that you weren’t going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news.But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time?What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it’s large or small?

Any color you can share on what has like actually happened? **Tim Cook:** It’s embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided.But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year.And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there’s been alternate app stores for some period of time of that.And so it’s -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals.There may be more to come and so forth.I don’t want to predict beyond the current quarter. **Wamsi Mohan:** Okay.

Thank you, Tim. **Suhasini Chandramouli:** Thank you, Wamsi.Operator, could we have the next question, please? **Operator:** Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.Please go ahead.
