David Vogt: Great.Thanks, guys.Thanks for taking my question.So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question.So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call?I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now?

And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year?And I'll give you my second one at the same time.You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs.Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically?Thanks.Tim Cook: In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain.

There's always risk in the supply chain.And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that.What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it.And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply.And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future.I'll let Kevan answer the other question.

Kevan Parekh: Hi, David.On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided.However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today.David Vogt: Okay.But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month?Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?

Kevan Parekh: I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.David Vogt: Okay.Thanks, Kevan.Thanks, guys.Kevan Parekh: Thank you.Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David.

Operator, could we have the next question, please?Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Please go ahead.Samik Chatterjee: Hi.Good afternoon.Thanks for taking my questions.

I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available.I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out.Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade?And I have a follow-up.Thank you.Tim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question.

During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available.A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3.Samik Chatterjee: Okay, got it.

Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro.And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent.But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer?And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact?We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q.When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point?

Thank you.Tim Cook: I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that.In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level.And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter.And so that's all I want to say about that.I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now.

The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.Samik Chatterjee: Thank you.Thanks for taking the questions.Tim Cook: Yes.Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik.Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.Please go ahead.
