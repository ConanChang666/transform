Bob Bartonï¼šThanks, Adam.Good morning, everyone.Last night, we reported first quarter 2025 FFO per share of $0.52.

First quarter 2025 net income attributable to common stockholders per share was $0.70.First quarter 2025 FFO decreased by approximately $0.03 or $0.52 per share compared to Q4 2024, primarily due to the impact of the Del Monte Center disposition on February 25, 2025, which contributed to a reduction of approximately $0.03 per FFO share.Same-store cash NOI for all sectors combined increased by 3.1% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.All sectors reported positive same-store cash NOI growth during the quarter with the exception of the mixed-use sector, as we'll discuss in a moment.Breaking it out by segment, our same-store office portfolio's NOI increased by 5.4% in Q1 2025, primarily due to the expiration of a contractual rent abatement related to a lease renewal at our Landmark at One Market Street property.Our same-store retail portfolio's NOI increased by 5.4% in Q1 2025, primarily driven by the expiration of a contractual rent abatement for a new tenant at Carmel Mountain Plaza, the commencement of new leases and contractual rent escalations at both Alamo Quarry and Carmel Mountain Plaza.

Additionally, the year-over-year comparison benefited from a onetime write-off of construction and progress expenses recorded in Q1 2024, which did not reoccur in Q1 2025.Our same-store multifamily portfolio's NOI was flat in Q1 2025 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower rental income at our Hassalo on Eighth, offsetting our same-store growth from our San Diego multifamily properties.And our mixed-use portfolio's NOI declined by approximately 11.6% in Q1 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by lower-than-anticipated occupancy at the Embassy Suites Waikiki.Specifically, number one, paid occupancy for Q1 2025 was approximately 85% compared to 90% in Q1 2024.Number two, RevPAR for Q1 2025 was $298, down 7% from Q1 2024.Our ADR for Q1 2025 was $353, down 1% from Q1 2024.

And lastly, net operating income for Q1 2025 was approximately $2.6 million compared to $3.4 million in Q1 2024.It is our understanding that virtually all hotels in Oahu are having similar results.However, as Adam mentioned earlier, we continue to outperform our comp set in Waikiki by both occupancy, ADR and RevPAR.We're also seeing that domestic mainland travelers are rethinking travel to Hawaii due to rising costs and airfare and hotel rates.Many travelers are opting for international vacations due to the strong US currency and more are taking all-inclusive cruises.But regardless of the near-term economic uncertainty, the charm, Aloha Spirit and safety and security in Oahu and other Hawaiian islands are not going away.

We believe this is just a moment in time.Let's talk about liquidity.At the end of the first quarter, we had liquidity of approximately $544 million, comprised of approximately $144 million in cash and cash equivalents and $400 million of availability on our revolving line of credit.

Additionally, as of the end of the first quarter, our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt to EBITDA was 6.2x on a trailing 12-month basis and 6.7x on a quarter annualized basis.Note that subsequent to year-end, we repaid our Term Loan B, Term Loan C and Series C notes totaling $325 million in the aggregate without penalty or premium, utilizing cash on hand, and now we have no debt maturities until 2027.Our objective is to achieve and maintain long-term net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times or below.Our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.2 times on a trailing 12-month basis.Let's talk about our 2025 guidance.We are reaffirming our full year 2025 guidance range of $1.87 to $2.01 per FFO share with a midpoint of $1.94 per FFO share underscoring our confidence in the strength and stability of our diversified portfolio.

This outlook reflects the continued momentum across our core sectors supported by steady leasing activity, contractual rent increases and disciplined operational execution.Our guidance assumptions continue to reflect a relatively healthy operating environment, sustained tenant demand and thoughtful risk management.Based on our first quarter results and our current visibility into the balance of the year, we believe we are reasonably positioned to achieve our full year objectives.

Moreover, while the reaffirmed guidance reflects our best estimate as of today's call, we acknowledge the potential to perform towards the upper end of the range and to achieve that several factors would need to align favorably.First, the majority of the office and retail tenants for whom we have established credit reserves must continue to meet their rent obligations through the year.As of Q1 2025, we have approximately $0.04 per share of FFO reserve for tenants deemed at risk based on a probability weighted approach.On that amount, approximately $0.01 per FFO share relates to office tenants and $0.03 to retail.Second, our multifamily segment would need to exceed expectations, driven by improved occupancy, continued rent growth or better-than-forecasted expense management.Third, a meaningful recovery in tourism would support stronger performance at our Embassy Suites property.

We remain cautiously optimistic that both domestic and international travel will improve either later this year or in the years ahead.Together, these elaborates represent upside potential, and we will continue to monitor each closely as the year progresses.As a reminder, our guidance and these prepared remarks exclude the impact of any future acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuances or repurchases and debt refinancings or repayments except for those already disclosed.We remain committed to transparency and we'll continue to provide clear insights into our quarterly results and the key assumptions that inform our outlook.

Additionally, please note that any non-GAAP financial metrics discussed today, such as net operating income or NOI, are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental materials.I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
