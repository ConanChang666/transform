Bob Barton: Sure.The submarket, the UTC or University Town Center submarket remains tight.Class A direct vacancy is 7.4%.And if you net out Tower 3 from that, the remainder is 4.6% direct vacant.That being said, it's not a big tenant market at this point.It's a smaller tenant market, full floor and below except for a few examples, one of which we're in proposals on a two-floor deal.

We're competing with a renewal where the renewing space would be 68,400 feet and our lease would be 41,000 feet.Our workplaces are highly efficient.It's a law firm.It would be going to have been in their space 10 years and they've been going from partners having bigger offices, associates having smaller offices to a one-size office fits all, which is the initiative that's being put forth in the West Coast for this major law firm.So it's -- we're competing for it.We're more efficient.

We offer building top signage that they don't.We have podium parking directly into the building versus the parking structure.We have better amenities.And so we'll see if we can overcome the inertia that goes with renewals, and we'll see how that plays out.

In addition, we are building spec suites on the entire fourth floor.Those will be completed in November, and we will see leasing activity pick up with of those suites, plus we've got amenities under construction.We've got a 7,000-foot conference center under construction.We've got the restaurant, the white table restaurant under construction.We've got the cafe under construction.So when those amenities are complete, [indiscernible]and we expect leasing to accelerate.
