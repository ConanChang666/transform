Catherine O'Brien: Hey.Good morning, everyone.Thanks so much for the time.Just one more on the 2Q revenue guidance, if you allow it.Steve, I think you were talking about you're expecting to see momentum in in international through the summer.That's looking strong, often with that being cabin.

So I guess underlying your revenue guidance, are you expecting each international geography to see PRASM improve relative to its one q performance and and the desal is all domestic or or have I got that scrambled?Steve Johnson: The I I I think what we are seeing is solid performance in the long haul international markets that is you know, improved year over year.It's hard to I think, to compare second quarter performance to first quarter performance because, you know, the demand's so different.But I would just say sequentially strong.It's still positive.If you if what you're asking is is the year over year growth in the second quarter as good as the year over year growth in the first quarter.

I'd say it's decelerating a little bit, but still strong and, again, fueled by really strong premium demand, really strong demand for the premium cabins.Catherine O'Brien: Understood.Thanks.And and maybe one for Devin.You guys understandably pulled for your EPS in this very uncertain backdrop and and, you know, there's downside bias to your capacity outlook.But if you wind up growing low single digits as was your plan back in January, you still thinking CASM would be up mid singles, or or would the incremental cost save you highlighted earlier, could could you do better than that?

Thanks for the time.Devon May: I I think if our our capacity ends up being largely in line with where we started the year, our costs are also going to be largely in line with where we started the year.Just say that we're best in the business at managing cost in the long term and also driving efficiencies over the long term that are good for our customers, also good for our team members.That was built into our plan for this year.So while there may be some trimming around the edges I think we have all of the right plans in place to run a really effective and efficient business this year.On the other side, if we do pull capacity, I think we're gonna be really effective in managing, costs out as well.

Operator: Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Steven Trent of Citi.Please go ahead, Steven.Steven Trent: Good morning, everybody.And thanks for taking my question.

First, I I was kind of curious.When we think about twenty twenty six, I know it seems like an eternity from now.But looking at sort of the World Cup event, on the horizon, would you guys expect any flux you know, vis a vis what we saw in the transatlantic for the the Paris Olympics last year.Or do you guys have a, like, say, a relative advantage versus other peers because of a a high US point of sale?Thank you.Robert Isom: Hey, Steven.

Thanks.No. Hey.We're really proud to to be a sponsor along with our partner, Qatar.It's the largest sporting event in in in the world, and it's unique in that it is spread out across the United States.Canada, and Mexico, and American Airlines Group is the strongest carrier in all of the host sit or in the vast majority of the host cities.So we're really we're really proud to be the title sponsor.

I tell you, this is an event that's that's very different than the Olympics.It's all concentrated in one city, you know, all at one time, that actually, in some cases, can can diminish the demand over a period of time.This is one in which we see tremendous interest in travel and spending time, and we don't believe it will have an impact on the other business that goes into these cities namely because it's spread out and because it will be something that is know, such a a focus.So tremendous excited.Americans are glad to be at the top of that, and it's just another indication of us building for the future.Steven Trent: Okay.

Super, Robert.Really appreciate that.And just as a quick follow-up to that, can you sort of refresh my memory approximately where is your the percentage of US point of sale for your international?Steve Johnson: We we about seventy five percent of our international is sold in US as US point of sale.Operator: Thank you.

Next question.Comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.Your line is open there, Ravi.Ravi Shanker: Good morning, thanks.Good morning, everyone.Just a follow-up on the normalization of share.

It indirect distribution and corporate.How much macro sensitive or agnostic is that share recovery?
