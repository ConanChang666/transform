以下是重排好的可讀段落式逐字稿：。Jamie Baker: Okay. And then following on Connor's question, and it wouldn't be an American earnings call, I suppose, if I didn't ask about one of your hubs. But looking at, Chicago, it it seems that a pretty material portion of the capacity restoration is really early in the morning or pretty late at night. I Can you comment on how RASM you know, sort of at the edges of the workday, however you define that, compares to that of I don't know. Daylight hours for lack of a better term. Although, I suppose that's not a good term for the summer. But you get the idea. Yeah. Steve Johnson: Sure, Jamie. I mean, as you grow markets, you you particularly hub markets, you you grow them by adding banks. And so we've added banks at the beginning of the day and the end of the day. There's There's obviously, those are those are gonna be weaker than in the heart of the day. But but they it's cheaper to add those by just improving your asset utilization. Also, it's important to know that, you know, the first slide of the day and the last slide of the day is really important. And so as we think about what we where we wanna end up and Chicago, that's that that's a big step, and, you know, ultimately, those we expect that those banks will improve performance as you know, we have the opportunity to to fly them and have the our customers get more remember American and and those will those will be better. Really important part of our local traffic offering for our Chicagoans is the banks are the first part of the day, and the banks for the last part of the day. So, yeah, they're that's that's what we had always planned and what you would have expected to see. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dwayne Fenigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, Dwayne. Dwayne Fenigwerth: Hey. Hey. Thanks. Appreciate the time. Just just on the corporate share recapture, it's hard to find that in your guidance and understand it's a it's a dynamic back drop for sure. But you know, what would be offsetting this share recapture if you're winning back corporates?Steve Johnson: From a margin and from a, I guess, implied, you know, RASM perspective. Thanks. I I think that you're not seeing it because it's it's overwhelmed by the weakness in our main cabin demand. Robert Isom: And, Steve, I'd I'd add to that. Our government business is Yeah. Is falling off considerably as well. So that would add to it as well. Dwayne Fenigwerth: Okay. And then apologies. I I really don't wanna ask another Chicago question, but I'll but I'll I'll venture down the path. Again, it might be hard to parse in this backdrop But can you contrast, you know, presumably, some of this was about taking pressure off of a market like Charlotte versus the investment that you're making in a market like Chicago, can you just you know, help us size you know, the the relative benefit in Charlotte from a RASM and margin perspective versus, you know, the relative investment in Chicago. And I guess, when are we done?What what inning are we in of that rebuild in Chicago?Thank you. A baseball question again. What what the what inning are we in in the rebuild of Chicago?It's right now, like, maybe the fourth inning, I think, is about right. Fourth or fifth inning, something like that. Steve Johnson: And our strategy to grow Chicago didn't have anything to do with our strategy in Charlotte. You know?

It Chicago was a place that that is a place that we have been very successful in the past. We took down our Chicago operation during the pandemic. As we we grew our operation after the pandemic, we deployed our assets in the places where demand was the strongest first. Chicago just, you know, was slower to to rebound. But now we're focused on rebuilding the position that we've traditionally had in Chicago. We understand that we'll probably always be second place in Chicago, but that's been you know, a very effective, and it means to serve our customers. Profitable, and a a a position that we like a lot. So that's what we're focused on is rebuilding Chicago. Because Chicago is a really important part of our network, not in Charlotte, you know, we've our our strategy there is to continue to be as large in Charlotte as we can operate. It's a, you know, very efficient, very geographically well placed hub. Very low cost for for purposes of connecting, but, we are, you know, close to capacity at that airport. And so we're just not in a position at least right now to grow it any further. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Catherine.
