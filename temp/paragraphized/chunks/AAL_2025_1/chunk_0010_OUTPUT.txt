以下是重排成「段落式逐字稿」的內容：。Devon May：Sure. I I'll just start by saying we are committed to reducing total debts under thirty five billion at the end of twenty twenty seven. And structurally, we're set up really well-to-do that. We've talked about our limited CapEx requirements over that period, so it gives us the potential for a lot of free cash flow. When we think about liquidity, you know, right now, we're holding ten point eight billion dollars We've talked that over time, as we continue to improve the balance sheet, we would expect our levels of liquidity to come down slightly. During this uncertain time, we're gonna, you know, continue to hold right around this ten billion dollar mark, but that is likely to change over time as we expand margins and improve the balance sheet. Andrew D'Dora：That's all I had. Thank you. Operator：Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald with of TD Cohen. Your question please, Tom. Tom Fitzgerald：Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I'm just kinda curious on corporate generally both you know, large manage managed accounts and the small, and medium sized enterprises. If if there's any pockets of green shoots or in any sectors that are demand is looking a little more resilient than some of the sectors like autos or agriculture that we hear about on the news, Steve Johnson：Thanks for the question. I you know, we are not seeing any know, real pullback in business travel at this point across the board. You know, that may come later. It'd be economy continues to deteriorate. But but right now, we're you know, our it all looks pretty vibrant. We we maybe look you know, have a better position to look in terms of in terms of improvement because of our sales distribution recovery efforts. But right now, business travel looks good across the board. Tom Fitzgerald：Okay. That's that's really helpful. And then just you know, going back to the the topic about know, international travel and cross cross border flows, What have your conversations been like, you know, with your government relations team or your contacts in in in DC about conveying the importance of smooth cross border flows to policy makers. Thanks again for the time. Robert Isom：No. I appreciate the question. Travel is incredibly important to to to the US. And I think people are aware that almost one in eleven jobs is tied to to travel. One point three trillion dollars of direct spending, two point nine trillion dollars of of overall spending in in in related outside of direct. This is an incredibly important sector to our to our economy. And we have to make this something that is know, the cornerstone of infrastructure. And that starts with not only doing the work we can domestically, but also making the country a a welcoming place. And as we work with the administration, just overall reducing concerns about certainty, we're also getting ready for, you know, where we should be. And that means making sure Visa wait times are very, very limited. That means that we open up travel without visa opportunities. That means that we work with the administration on safe and secure so that when you when you come to one of our our poor that it's easy to get into and you feel like it's it's a process that's not cumbersome. Then, ultimately, we look to the future of making sure that the industry as a whole can continue to grow. That's the long term plan. And from that perspective, we're working with the administration on air traffic control reform, which is likely the biggest limiter to to to growth in the industry as we look at, you know, over several years. Operator：Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the Q and A session is open and for media questions. We are open for media questions. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Cider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open, Allison. Allison Sider：Hi. Thanks so much. I guess, just wanna ask a broad question. On the economy. And I'm just curious, you know, Robert, like, do you are you expecting?Like, do you expect the US economy to to sort of tip into a recession and kind of what are you watching or keeping an eye on to to gauge whether that's happening?
