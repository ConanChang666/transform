以下是重排為段落式逐字稿的內容：。Robert Isom：Hey, Mary. I appreciate the question. So first off, aircraft cost too much already. I don't wanna pay any more for aircraft It doesn't make sense. And, certainly, you know, we're pulling guidance. Certainly, this is not something we would intend to absorb. And I'll tell you, it's not something that I would expect our customers to welcome. So we've gotta work on this. We fortunately don't have any near term deliveries. We have deliveries at the end of the year that would be potentially subject to tariffs. The three twenty one XLRs that are built over in Europe But I would tell you, we gotta do some work before then. And from an overall perspective, I would tell you there's good reason to do something in regard to aviation civil aviation. Because since nineteen seventy nine, we've operated under a tariff regime that has been zero for zero. No tariffs in and no tariffs, you know, purchasing at That's worked very well for civil aviation. And by that, I mean, everything from, you know, aircraft to engines and and and to parts as well. That framework has led to an industry, a sector, that has produced the largest level of exports the largest level of surplus of any industry. And so I know that that's where we wanna end up. Now there may be changes to to that framework, but the end result has to be that the US is a powerhouse and continues to be incredibly strong from an aviation perspective. We're part of that. You know, we're the the we ultimately operate these aircraft. And I I anticipate in working with with the administration that we're gonna end up with with a framework that really does ensure that aviation in the US is competitive. Now in regard to questions about our people, you know, right now, we are planning for the the peak of our schedule. And so we're getting ready for that as we take a look into the fall, it's generally not a time where we do a lot of hiring, but we're we're very focused on that. Right now, we don't quite know exact And and that's certainly coloring our views of twenty twenty six as well. So stay tuned on that. Right now, you know, we're we're We're gonna be nimble depending on what we see in in the the environment. Operator：Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Joseph of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie. Leslie Josephs：Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you're seeing any gains market share in the Dallas area, since your competitor announced bad fees and some of the other policy changes. That there's any kind of detail on the take up rate of status matches and things like that. And then broadly on, domestic demand, directionally, is it getting worse?Is it getting better?And are there any geographies that you're seeing or or doing worse or better?I'm seeing seven, eight hundred dollar tickets New York, LA, the summer, and then a hundred dollar tickets to Florida. So kinda curious if you could break down where you're seeing the the weakness in the main cabin. Thanks. Steve Johnson：Leslie, hi. Thanks. It's it's Steve on on first on the the DFW question, we have a great product. It's in DFW. It's our largest hub. We've fantastic penetration for our frequent flyer program. Fantastic number of co grand cardholders. We're gonna operate the largest operation at DFW in history this summer. So we're really well positioned to compete We've competed with Southwest, you know, through thick and thin over the last forty years very successfully. We recognized that they've you know, made a very significant change in their business model. We saw that they were reported some good numbers yesterday, but, we, you know, we're prepared to compete with them in DFW is is our favorite place to compete with them. With respect to demand, I I just reiterate what I said earlier is that what we're seeing is, you know, strength in the premium cabins, strength in long haul international, strength in bookings through indirect trials, you know, through travel agencies, and pretty significant weakness in, you know, the the the part of our business that is, you know, that's very sensitive to economic conditions that is super price sensitive or that is, you know, for whom travel is really discretionary, that tends to be our the main cabin, and that's that is weak, and and the other airlines have identified that it's a source of weakness for them. And in those circumstances, you do see prices that are lower. You do see some of the sales prices that you quoted I think that's gonna continue to be the case until we understand where, you know, which direction the economy is going and and we remove some of this uncertainty and some of that demand comes off the sidelines. Operator：This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?
