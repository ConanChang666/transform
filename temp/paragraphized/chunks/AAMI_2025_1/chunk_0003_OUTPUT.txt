Melody Huang : Thanks, Kelly.Acadian has low leverage ratios with high liquidity position.At the end of the first quarter 2025, we have $119.6 million in cash and $91.5 million in fee investments.Debt including outstanding balance on revolving credit facility of $80 million reflects draws to support first quarter seasonal needs and is expected to be fully paid down by year-end.Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2x as of March 31, '25, and our net leverage ratio was just 1.3x as of end of Q1 '25.AAMI Board declared an interim dividend of $0.01 per share to be paid on June 27, 2025.

Our balance sheet provides liquidity and financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy and to enhance shareholder value.We have demonstrated a track record of creating significant value through buybacks to our shareholders.Outstanding diluted shares went down 57% from $86 million in Q4 2019 to 37 million shares in Q1 2025. $1.4 billion in excess capital was returned to shareholders over the last 5 years through share buybacks and dividends.During the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of common stock or 2% of total outstanding shares for an aggregate total of $19.4 million.We expect to continue generating strong free cash and deploying excess capital towards supporting organic growth and share buybacks.Now I'm going to turn the call back to Kelly.

Kelly Young: Thanks, Melody.Slide 16 highlights that Acadian is positioning for multiple expansions and value creation.The AAMI stock PE multiple based on last 12 months earning is around 9x.Our peer asset managers' average is higher at around 12x, indicating a 33% premium.Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock price is at $26.69 as of the 29th of April 2025.If we apply that 33% increase to get our stock to the same 12x as our peers' average multiple, the implied price would be $35.50.

This presents a compelling investment opportunity in AAMI given our strong growth potential.Before going into Q&A, I'd like to recap the key points in this presentation.We're the only pure-play publicly traded systematic manager.We have a nearly 40-year track record with competitive edge in systematic investing and Acadian's investment performance track record remains strong with more than 90% of strategies by revenue outperforming over 3-, 5- and 10-year periods.We started 2025 with outstanding performance.Q1 '25 ENI EPS is up 23% from Q1 of 2024.

We delivered positive Q1 NCCF of $3.8 billion, our best quarterly flows in 19 years.We will continue to drive growth through targeted distribution initiatives and accelerate growth through key product initiatives such as enhanced equity.Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock is trading at a modest PE multiple of 9x compared to our peer average of 12x.Acadian is well positioned to generate value for shareholders.Our team's focus, talent and hard work have been instrumental in achieving these milestones, and I look forward to building on this momentum and driving further growth and innovation.This concludes my prepared remarks.

And at this point, I'd be delighted to take your questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.Michael Cyprys : Congratulations on the strong flows here, best in 19 years.That's great to see.Nearly $9 billion gross sales, nearly $4 billion of net inflows.Maybe you could just unpack some of the key strategies that you saw contributing?

And can you just remind us what the revenue impact was of those flows as we think about the organic base fee impact stemming from the strong flows in the quarter?
