<think> Okay, let's tackle this query.The user provided a transcript of Nicole Stokes speaking about the company's quarterly results.They want me to convert the sentence-by-sentence transcript into a paragraph format without deleting or altering anything.

First, I need to make sure I understand the task correctly.The key points are: no deletions, no summaries, just restructuring.The original transcript is from a call, so the person is likely giving a presentation or report.The challenge is grouping the sentences into coherent paragraphs while preserving the order and content.Looking at the original, each sentence is separated by a line break.I need to read through each line and identify where natural pauses or topic shifts occur.

For instance, she talks about net income, efficiency ratio, return on assets, capital, stock repurchases, then shifts to revenue, non-interest income, expenses, balance sheet, and finally concluding remarks.Each of these sections can form a paragraph.I should start by grouping sentences that discuss similar themes.For example, the first few sentences about net income and net interest income can form the first paragraph.

Then, moving on to efficiency ratios and return on assets in the next.Each financial metric she mentions should be grouped together.I also need to watch for transitions like "On the revenue side of things," which indicates a new topic.Similarly, "During the first quarter we recorded..." is another new section.Ensuring that these transitions are respected in the paragraph structure is important.Another thing to note is the repetition or connections between sentences.

For instance, when she mentions the expansion of the net interest margin and then the reasons behind it, those should stay together.Similarly, the part about deposit growth and the cyclical outflow needs to be grouped to maintain context.I'll need to check for any numbers or percentages that are tied to specific topics and ensure they stay with their respective statements.Also, the mention of future expectations, like "we believe that we will still see..." should be with the preceding statements about the deposit margin.I should avoid using any markdown and just use line breaks for paragraphs.Since the user wants a clean, readable version, using clear topic sentences and logical grouping will enhance readability without altering content.

Let me go through the transcript again, paragraph by paragraph, making sure each thought flows and that the structure mirrors the natural presentation of the speaker.Also, confirming that all technical terms and financial jargon are correctly grouped to preserve their meaning. </think> Nicole Stokes: Great.Thank you, Palmer.For the first quarter, we reported net income of $87.9 million or $1.27 per diluted share.That’s a 17% increase over the first quarter of last year, and one of the things that I’m really proud of is the fact that that increase is fully from our growth in net interest income.Our net interest income increased $20 million this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year, while our provision and non-interest expense remained relatively flat over the same period.

So our efficiency ratio improved to 52.83% this quarter compared to 55.64% the first quarter of last year.This quarter our return on assets remained strong at 136, our PPNR ROA was at 2.08%, and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 13.16%.We continue to build capital and we remain focused on growing shareholder value.We grew tangible book value per share by $1.19 to end the quarter at $39.78 and our tangible common equity ratio increased to 10.78% at the end of the quarter.We did repurchase approximately $15 million of common stock, or 253,000 shares, during the first quarter, and we have approximately $85 million remaining available to purchase through the end of October.On the revenue side of things, our net interest income for the quarter was relatively flat, which is a nice positive because of the reduced day count in the first quarter.

Both interest income and interest expense both decreased about $12.5 million, but that was a decline of only 6 basis points on the asset side and a much stronger 23 basis point decline on the interest-bearing deposit side.Our net interest margin expanded 9 basis points to a strong 3.73%.I need to remind everyone that this margin is a core margin; we don’t have any accretion left in the margin that we have to worry about going away and backfilling.The expansion this quarter came from 6 basis points on the asset side as well as 3 basis points from the positive deposit mix.Our bankers did a great job protecting and growing deposits this quarter.The cyclical outflow of public funds was slower than expected during the quarter, and we were able to fund what did flow out with core deposit growth rather than all wholesale funding as predicted.

Also proving to be better than expected on the margin, with the recent market disruption, we did not see the deposit pricing pressure that we expected due to slower than expected loan growth.We believe that we will still see a margin normalize above 3.60% over the next few quarters.As the remaining public funds cycle out, we replace those with wholesale funding, and we expect pressure on deposits as we see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year.We continue to be close to neutral on asset liability sensitivity.During the first quarter, we recorded a $21.9 million provision for credit losses; increase our reserve to 1.67% of loans and improving to 342% of portfolio NPLs.Our total non-performing assets as a percentage of assets improved at 44 basis points and our charge-offs were stable again this quarter at 18 basis points.

Non-interest income decreased $4.9 million this quarter, mostly with reduced gains on sale of SBA loans of $3.2 million and then a small decline in revenue in the mortgage division of $1.4 million, as we’ve seen tightness in the housing market with volatile rates.A real win was our total non-interest expense, which it decreased $915,000 in the first quarter, which was great to see because we usually have that first quarter bump from cyclical payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions.As I previously mentioned, our efficiency ratio was strong at 52.83% this quarter.On the balance sheet side, we ended the quarter with total assets of $26.5 billion compared to $26.3 billion at the end of the year.Loans were roughly stable this quarter, and deposits increased $190 million.That represents a 4% annualized deposit growth.

Interest-bearing deposits fell slightly in the quarter, although we were able to grow non-interest-bearing deposits at a nice 15% annualized growth rate.This quarter’s deposit growth included the headwind of the seasonal outflow about $406 million of our cyclical municipal deposits.Brokered CDs increased only $246 million to offset those, so we grew our non-brokered, non-municipal deposits by $349 million.Loan balances declined slightly during the quarter, reflecting continued seasonality in our mortgage warehouse and mortgage portfolio.Total loan production in the first quarter was $1.5 billion, down slightly from the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but higher than our year ago level.Our non-interest-bearing deposits represent a healthy 30.8% of total deposits and our brokered CDs represent less than 5% of total deposits.

We continue to anticipate 2025 loan and deposit growth in the mid-single digits.I want to close by reiterating how well positioned we are and how focused we are on a successful 2025.And with that, I’ll wrap it back up and turn the call over to Andrea for any questions from the group.Thank you, Andrea.
