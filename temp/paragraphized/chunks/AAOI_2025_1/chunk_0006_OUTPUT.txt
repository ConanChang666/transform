<think> 好的，用户让我把一段逐句切开的逐字稿整理成段落式，并且要求不删减任何一句话。我需要先仔细检查每个句子，然后根据说话人的转换和上下文合理分段。首先，用户提供的逐字稿中有多个说话人，包括Stefan Murry、Tim Savageaux、Thompson Lin、Operator和Dave Kang。每个说话人之间会有明显的切换，比如Stefan Murry说完后，Tim Savageaux提问，接着Thompson Lin补充，然后又有Operator引入下一个提问者Dave Kang。接下来，我需要确定每个说话人所说的内容是否应该合并到同一段落中。比如，Stefan Murry在谈论PAA要求和制造地点，这部分应该连贯，保持为一个段落。

Thompson Lin解释设计认证的三个阶段，应该整合成一段，中间如果有补充说明的话，比如Stefan Murry插入关于营收的部分，可能需要分开处理，但根据规则不能删改，所以要保留并合理分段。Tim Savageaux和Thompson Lin之间的对话可能涉及多个问题，比如关于设计认证是否是800G的提问和回答，需要确保每个问题和回答都被正确地分组。同样，当Operator介绍新问题时，Dave Kang的提问和Stefan Murry的回答需要各自独立段落。还要注意说话人之间的过渡，例如从Stefan到Thompson，再到Tim，再到Operator，每个转换点都应有明确的开始。同时，要检查是否所有句子都正确归位于相应说话人之下，没有遗漏或错误。比如，Thompson Lin提到设计认证的三个阶段后，Stefan Murry补充关于营收的部分，应作为同一段落中的不同发言。

最后，确保没有使用任何标点或格式来替代正确的段落分隔，所有原始内容都按顺序保留，并且每个段落清晰反映说话人连续的陈述，符合用户不删减、不修改的要求。完成后，再通读一遍检查是否有错漏，确保每个句子都被正确放置，并且段落之间自然流畅。</think> 【段落式逐字稿】：。Stefan Murry : And now, not the only invoice size is the PAA. That is a requirement. If you are doing business with U.S. government, you cannot manufacture in Thailand, Malaysia, China. So, we PAA right now is one of very few transceiver suppliers are meeting PAA requirement. We manufacture either in Taiwan or in Houston. And that's another key, especially for high-end transceiver products, for a space for AI. Tim Savageaux : And going back to the design wins, I think you'd mentioned there were three with one existing hyperscale customer. Can you say whether those are 800 gig design wins?Stefan Murry : None of them were 800 gig. Thompson Lin : We assembled -- there were other qualifications. We assembled hyperscale data center. Let me say that. Going now, when we say design win, we need to go through three phases. So, right now, for some products, some customers, we are doing in the final phase, that means you need to deliver something like a few thousand or 10,000. And you need to put it in data center for final qualification for one month and make sure quality is okay. Then you start looking into volume delivery. But for the lab qualification, we have tests already. So, for a few simple customers, simple product, we are in the final qualification phase. Or you can say it's the final phase, okay?Stefan Murry : Which is why we talked about having some revenue, not big material revenue, but some revenue for 800 gig in the quarter. Thompson Lin : No, but you're not so bad, okay?

Still like maybe 5,000 piece or 10,000 piece, okay?So, it's not like 100 or 200 piece, okay?Tim Savageaux : And Stefan, you kind of alluded to it, but my last question was going to be, I guess, around what sort of share you think that agreement at Amazon gives you relative to their total consumption?Stefan Murry : Well, I think, as Thomson mentioned a few moments ago, our belief, our expectation, is that we can grow to be, the largest supplier of 800G and faster, higher data rate optics for Amazon. Now, that's not guaranteed by any means, but I don't see any reason why we couldn't be there. And that would imply a market share; typically, they're going to have two or three suppliers, so that would be, maybe 30, maybe even up to 40%. Thompson Lin : What's fair right now is tariffs, and as I said, TAA, T is very important. As I said, especially for high-end AI transceiver, and that's why I say we are much more competent. I cannot say 100%, but personally, I believe more than 90% or 95% of AI will become the major supplier for Amazon, including other hyperscale data centers, which I would say by sometime next year, Q2, Q3, I would say more than 40% might be shared. Tim Savageaux : Great. Thanks very much. Operator: The next question comes from Dave Kang of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Dave Kang : Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is regarding the inventory digestion situation. Just wondering if that was 400 gig, and do you expect that to recover in the second quarter, or how long will that go on?Stefan Murry: Yes, it was 400 gig, and yes, we expect it to largely resolve in the second quarter. Dave Kang : Got it. And then just on the margin situation, what's the margin differential between cable TV and data center transceivers, and is there any difference between 400 gig and maybe 800 gig when you start to ship next quarter?Stefan Murry: I'm sorry. Your first question was about the margin difference between... Dave Kang : Yes, cable TV and transceivers. Stefan Murry: Yes. So, I mean, the margin on cable is somewhat higher. It varies a little bit, based on product mix within the data center market. I mean, the cable market, relatively speaking, has a lot less product diversity in there. There's just a few products versus data center, which has a lot more. So, the mix affects the data center overall margin a little bit more. But it's anywhere from, I would say, I don't know, 300 basis points, 400 basis points to maybe 600 basis points higher for cable right now. And we expect the cable will expand as we continue to wring efficiencies out of our manufacturing process. Data center will expand. The margin there will expand based on somewhat on economies of scale, but more likely on the transition to 800 gig and eventually 1.6 terabit. Dave Kang : And then just regarding your 800 gig qualification status, can you just remind us how many you got going?

And it sounds like they've been going on for a while, right?I mean, at least the last summer, so maybe, I don't know, eight, nine months. Is that kind of a typical process?And in your prepared remarks, you talk about you got some new qualifications. So, should we expect similar eight to nine months or any thoughts on that?
