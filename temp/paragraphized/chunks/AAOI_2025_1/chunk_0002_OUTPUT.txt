Thompson Lin: Thank you, Lindsay, and thank you for joining our call today.We are pleased to deliver first quarter results that were in line or better than our expectations.We continue to see strong demand in the CATV market and achieve the highest quarterly CATV revenue in AOI's history.During the first quarter, we continue to make progress on our data center business with three new design wins and exceeding hyperscale data center customers during the quarter.During the first quarter, we delivered a revenue of $99.9 million, which was in line with our current range of $94 million to $104 million.We recorded non‑GAAP gross margin of 30.7 %, which was above the top end of our guidance range of 29 % to 30.5 %.

All non‑GAAP loss per share of $0.02 was in line with our guidance range of a loss of $0.07 to break even.Total revenue for our data center products of $32 million increased 11 % year‑over‑year, but was down 28 % sequentially due to inventory digestion on one product by one of our customers.During the quarter, we began several new qualification efforts to support existing qualifications on energy products with several large hyperscale customers.Total revenue in our CATV segment was $64 million, which increased more than 6 times year‑over‑year and increased 24 % sequentially, largely driven by continued shipment of our 1.8 gigahertz amplifiers for one of our major MSO customers.As we have discussed on our prior earning calls, our MSO customers are in the process of upgrading their outside plan networks so that they can support higher bandwidth in the return path direction and eventually enable DOCSIS 4.0.With that, I will turn the call over to Stefan to review the details of our Q1 performance and our overview.

Stefan.
