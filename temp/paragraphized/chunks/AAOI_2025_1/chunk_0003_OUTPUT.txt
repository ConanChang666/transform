Stefan Murry : Thank you, Thompson.We are pleased to deliver results that were in line or better than our expectations in the first quarter.We started the year with a considerable momentum.Compared to Q1 of last year, our revenue more than doubled, and we expanded our gross margin by over 1,000 basis points.We also generated positive non-GAAP EBITDA in the quarter.We continued to see strong demand in the CATV market and achieved the highest quarterly CATV revenue in AOI's history during the first quarter.

Further, we continued to make progress on our data center business with three new design wins with an existing hyperscale data center customer during the quarter.Looking ahead, we continue to believe that these positive long-term growth trends in both our CATV and data center markets will benefit our business.While we continue to closely monitor news of tariffs, in Q1, tariffs had no material impact on our financials.We do not expect a significant impact in Q2 based on what we know at this point.We are maintaining a posture of flexibility and vigilance.We are continuously assessing our supply chain and manufacturing operations with an eye towards minimizing tariff impacts.

At OFC, we unveiled our near-term targets for adding production capacity for 800G and higher transceivers at our existing plant in Texas.I am pleased to report that we remain on track for these targets, which will culminate later this year with what we believe will be the largest domestic production capacity, expected to be approximately 40,000 transceivers per month or roughly 40% of our overall capacity for these advanced 800G optical transceivers.By mid-2026, we expect to be able to produce over 200,000 pieces per month, with the majority produced in Texas.Currently, we have already begun to order the equipment necessary to bring up production of our 800G at our current facility outside of Houston, and initial production capacity is on track to be shipping product later this summer.We believe that our largely in-house developed production automation capabilities uniquely position us to be able to rapidly scale manufacturing in the U.S., and we remain committed to offering our customers the option to purchase these products onshore.

In addition, while we do utilize some imported components in our transceivers, many key components, like our laser chips, are already manufactured in the U.S. Importantly, in our 800G and 1.6 terabit transceiver designs, less than 10% of the value of the components used is currently sourced from China, and we have a pathway as we scale production to further reducing this China content ultimately to near zero.We are also in discussion with several key suppliers about onshoring their production to the U.S. to support a robust domestic supply chain.Our customers have indicated their need for a reliable domestic manufacturer of next-generation optics, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from them regarding our plans.As Thompson mentioned earlier, our Q1 highlights include delivering revenue of $99.9 million, which was in line with our guidance range of $94 million to $104 million, and non-GAAP gross margin of 30.7%, which was above our guidance range of 29% to 30.5%.And lastly, our non-GAAP loss per share of $0.02 was within our guidance range of a loss of $0.07 to break even.During the first quarter, we continued to deliver on our initiatives that we had previously laid out.

We continue to believe that the long-term demand drivers for our data center business are strong, as our customers continue to build out their next-generation AI-focused data center architectures.We believe that we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these tailwinds, and our efforts are centered on fulfilling our customers' needs with high quality and speed.In our data center business, on the back of the announcement we made with Amazon in mid-March, we're working diligently to deliver the products which they are going to need to be qualified in their data center.We continue to expand the depth and breadth of our interactions with Amazon as we mutually look to expand revenue opportunities for AOI to reach the $400 million or more annually that it will take to fully earn the warrants that we agreed to in March.We saw impressive turnout at the OFC trade show, where we continued to engage in meaningful dialogue with our customers, particularly with some of our larger hyperscale customers, and demonstrated our next-generation technology, including CPO.Further, we received positive feedback from our 800G and 1.6 terabit product demos.

We are active in building out our capacity to address 400G and 800G product demand, which I will touch on further in a moment, and we are seeing a growing demand for both of these products.In Q1, demand for certain 100G products unexpectedly surged in the quarter, which we believe may be related to tariff concerns.Our production capacity on these 100G products was limited by supply constraints as we worked to meet this increased demand.We are working with our supplier on these parts and expect partial recovery in Q2 and a full recovery by Q3, which will be positive for both our revenue and gross margin.We continue to make progress on customer qualifications on our 800G products and are being asked by several customers to expedite production earlier than previously requested, especially as we expect to bring U.S. production online in Q3 of this year.This demand pulling continues to increase our confidence in a second-half 2025 ramp for 800G.

While immaterial to our overall revenue, we did record some revenue for our 800G products in the first quarter related to deliveries for customer qualification activity.Turning to our CATV business, as Thompson mentioned, after receiving a substantial order for our quantum bandwidth networking products from a top North American cable operator last quarter, our product shipments have begun to ramp.We are currently being deployed in multiple geographic markets by a major North American MSO, and new markets are being added regularly as technicians are trained and products are staged for deployment.Our Motorola housing style amplifier products are slated for full qualification and field trial this month, and forecasts for delivery of these products begin in June.This nearly doubles our available market from what we are seeing on only gain-maker style amplifiers.In Q2, we are balancing production to ensure we have sufficient stock of both types of amplifiers in the U.S. by late June.

Lastly, during the quarter, we expanded our production capacity to further diversify our manufacturing capabilities and to add additional resilience to our business model.As a reminder, we currently have three manufacturing sites.One here in Sugar Land, Texas, where our headquarters is, one in Ningbo, China, and one in Taipei, Taiwan.As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we have been retrofitting our facility in Sugar Land, Texas, to accommodate new automated production equipment, which we plan to receive beginning in June.This equipment will be used for the production of both 800G and 1.6 terabit transceiver products, which we expect will be produced and delivered from Sugar Land beginning later this summer.During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned on our last call, we signed an agreement to lease an additional building in Taiwan, which we began outfitting in Q1 in order to increase production of our 100G, 400G, and 800G data center transceiver and CATV products there.

As you may have heard me say at OFC, we expect to increase production in both our U.S. and Taiwan locations by eight and a half times by the end of the year, and we are dedicated to achieving this goal.We have already begun ordering equipment to enable this ramp.Turning to our first quarter results, our total revenue was $99.9 million, which more than doubled year over year and was essentially flat sequentially off a strong Q4 and was in line with our guidance range of $94 million to $104 million.During the first quarter, 65% of revenue was from CATV products, 32% was from data center products, with the remaining 3% from FTTH, telecom, and other.In our data center business, Q1 revenue came in at $32 million, which was up 11% year over year and was down 28% sequentially.The sequential decrease was due to seasonality as well as inventory digestion from one of our largest hyperscale customers.

Also, as I mentioned above, demand for some of our legacy 100G products surged in the quarter, but supply constraints on one of the components used prevented us from fully delivering on this demand, and we are working to rectify the supply constraint as we move into Q2 and beyond.Looking ahead to Q2, we expect a sequential increase in our data center revenue.In the first quarter, 78% of data center revenue was from 100G products, 10% was from 200G and 400G transceiver products, and 10% was from 40G transceiver products.In our CATV business, CATV revenue in the first quarter was $64.5 million, which was up more than 6 times year over year and increased 24% sequentially.This significant increase is due to the continued ramp in orders for our 1.8 GHz amplifier products.In Q1, we were essentially at our manufacturing capacity for CATV production, given current production equipment and staffing, but we believe that our current capacity approximates demand from our customer base.

Looking ahead to Q2, we expect a modest pullback in CATV revenue as we retool production to our Motorola-style amplifier products.Now turning to our telecom segment, revenue from our telecom products of $2.9 million was up 29% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially.Looking ahead, we continue to expect telecom sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.For the first quarter, our top 10 customers represented 97% of revenue, up from 92% in Q1 of last year.We had two greater than 10% customers, one in the CATV market, which contributed 64% of total revenue, and one in the data center market, which contributed 27% of total revenue.In Q1, we generated non-GAAP gross margin of 30.7%, which was above our guidance range of 29% to 30.5%, and was up from 28.9% in Q4 of 2024 and 18.9% in Q1 of 2024.

The increase in our gross margin was driven primarily by our favorable product mix, including growth in our CATV revenue.Looking ahead, we continue to expect that our gross margin will improve further as we see the impact of manufacturing efficiencies in our CATV production and improving product mix.We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning our non-GAAP gross margin to around 40% and continue to believe that this goal is achievable.Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $35.5 million, or 36% of revenue, which compared to $24.8 million or 61% of revenue in Q1 of the prior year, primarily due to increases in R&D and G&A being driven by increased business activity.Looking ahead, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $36 million to $40 million per quarter.Non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter was $4.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $17.1 million in Q1 of the prior year.

GAAP net loss for Q1 was $9.2 million or a loss of $0.18 per basic share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $23.2 million or a loss of $0.60 per basic share in Q1 of 2024.On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for Q1 was $0.9 million or $0.02 per share, which compared to our guidance range of a loss of $3.6 million to break even or a loss per share in the range of $0.07 to break even per basic share.This compares to a non-GAAP net loss of $12 million or $0.31 per basic share in Q1 of the prior year.The basic shares outstanding used for computing the earnings per share in Q1 were $50 million.For the full year, we expect to generate positive non-GAAP net income.Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $66.8 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash.

This compares with $79.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.We ended the quarter with total debt, excluding convertible debt, of $46.1 million, compared to $46 million at the end of last quarter.As of March 31, we had $102.3 million in inventory, which compared to $88.1 million at the end of Q4.The increase in inventory is primarily for raw materials needed for production of both CATV and data center products.As we disclosed in February, we initiated a new at-the-market offering.To date, we have raised $98 million net of commissions and fees under this new program.

We intend to use these proceeds to continue to make investments in the business, including new equipment and machinery for production and research and development use, including the earlier mentioned production expansion in Texas.We made a total of $30.5 million in capital investments in the first quarter, which was mainly used for manufacturing capacity expansion for our 400G and 800G transceiver products.On our last earnings call, we discussed our plans to make sizable CapEx investments over the next several quarters as we prepare for increased 400G, 800G, and 1.6 terabit data center product production in 2025.For the year, we continue to expect between $120 million and $150 million in total CapEx.While these costs could be impacted from the tariffs, given the evolving nature, it is difficult to predict what type of impact or by how much.We will continue to do our best to minimize any impacts.

In any event, it's clear to us that U.S.-based production is top of mind for our customers, and we remain committed to building out this capacity, with production expected to start later this summer.Moving now to our Q2 outlook, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $100 million and $110 million, accounting for a modest sequential decrease in CATV revenue and a sequential increase in data center revenue.We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 29.5% to 31%.Non-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of a loss of $4.8 million to a loss of $1.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share between a loss of $0.09 per share and a loss of $0.03 per share, using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 55.7 million shares.With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for the Q&A session.Operator?
