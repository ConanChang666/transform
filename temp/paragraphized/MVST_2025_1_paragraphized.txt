This innovative platform is designed to provide us with unprecedented manufacturing flexibility allowing for fabrication of all solid-state cells in a wide range of variable sizes and customized shapes.This adaptability in design could be a significant differentiator in meeting the diverse needs of future applications.Turning to second point.We are also very encouraged by the early results from our bipolar stock cell architecture preliminary testing our five-layer cell operating at a 0.33C rate has already demonstrated very high Coulombic efficiency of 99.89%.These initial findings suggest that this stacked cell design holds considerable promise for enhanced performance and improved system level efficiency compared to traditional cell configurations.While those are early results, we are actively engaged in further validation and rigorous long-term testing to fully understand and optimize the potential of this exciting technology.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Schultz to discuss our financials in more detail.Pat Schultz: Thank you, Mr. Wu and thank you everyone for tuning in.I will now walk you through our financial performance.Please turn to slide 12.As Mr. Wu mentioned, we achieved a record first quarter with revenue reaching $116.5 million up 43% from $81.4 million in Q1 2024.This growth was fueled by strong EMEA sales for commercial vehicles.

Gross profit for Q1 2025 was $43 million up from $17.2 million in Q1 2024, a 150% improvement driven by operational execution, increased utilization and disciplined cost control implementation.Our gross margin improved to 36.9% up from 21.2% in Q1 2024, a 15.7 percentage point improvement.Operating expenses were reduced to $25.5 million in Q1 2025 compared to $40.9 million in Q1 2024, a 38% decrease from the prior period.This reduction across G&A and R&D was largely due to reductions in share-based compensation and cost control measures we implemented throughout 2024.The increase in sales and marketing was primarily due to our global marketing efforts and customer engagement activities as we continue to expand our product footprint.We reported a GAAP net profit of $61.8 million in Q1 2025 compared to a net loss of $24.8 million in Q1 2024.

After adjusting for non-cash items such as share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of our warrant liability and convertible loans adjusted net profit came to $19.3 million a substantial improvement from an adjusted net loss of $13 million in Q1 2024.After adjusting for non-cash share-based compensation expenses, our adjusted operating expenses in Q1 2025 decreased to $24.9 million compared to $30.1 million in Q1 2024.We reported positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reaching $28.5 million, as we maintain our focus on achieving sustainable profitability compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million in Q1 2024.The impact of these adjustments and reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics are included in the tables at the end of our press release and this slide presentation.On Slide 13, we show the geographic breakdown of our revenue mix for Q1 2025 compared to the prior period.Our EMEA business grew by 108% year-over-year and accounted for 52% of our quarterly revenue, up from 36% a year ago as we continue to grow our partnerships and key customers continue to ramp their vehicle production.

The U.S. increased from 2% to 5% of revenue share compared to Q1 2024, as we continue making inroads with domestic commercial vehicle customers.The APAC region saw a decrease of less than 1% year-over-year, as we continue to target higher-margin opportunities.Please turn to Slide 14 and we will briefly review our cash flow for the period.Net profit for the three-month period was primarily offset by a $19.4 million increase in net receivables, a $15.8 million decrease in inventory and a $21.3 million decrease in net liabilities and accrued expenses.There was also a noncash adjustment of $43.2 million from the changes in fair value of warrant liability and convertible loan.This resulted in positive operating cash flow of $7.2 million.

From investing activities, we saw an outflow of $2.3 million for the period primarily due to net capital expenditures.For financing cash flow, we saw a net inflow of $9.5 million.Overall combined with a slightly negative impact from exchange rates of $0.9 million, we had an increase in cash of $13.4 million.This resulted in total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $123 million at the end of the quarter.Our financial performance underscores the development of a profitable and resilient foundation supported by increasing market demand notably in EMEA.Our ongoing emphasis on achieving sustainable profitability enhancing margins and improving operational efficiencies is further solidifying our standing.

We remain dedicated to executing our strategic vision and are confident that our continued progress will increasingly highlight the intrinsic value Microvast offers to the energy storage and electric vehicle markets.With that, I will hand it back over to Mr. Wu to go over our outlook and closing remarks.Yang Wu: Thank you.Please turn to Slide 16, which provides a summary outlook for the rest of the year.As we look ahead through the remainder of 2025, our initial guidance remains an anticipated year-over-year revenue increase of 18% to 25%, placing our target range between $450 million and $475 million.We also continue to aim for full year gross margin of approximately 30%.

Our APAC operations are focused on bringing the Phase 3.2 expansion, at our Huzhou facility online, later this year.This additional capacity expected to reach up to 2 gigawatt hour annually, will be crucial in meeting the robust customer demand, across our diverse portfolio.Our team are also making significant advancements in developing new and exciting products, that will further enrich our offerings.We anticipate that our high-growth EMEA business, will maintain its strong momentum, continuing to drive year-over-year revenue increases.We are actively pursuing new strategic partnerships in the region to support both our current and upcoming product lines.In America, we foresee continued revenue growth and our company remains diligent in assessing its financial needs and evaluating available options, to support our strategic objectives in current and future markets.

Despite navigating specific regional market pressures, our proactive cost management and a strategic focus on high-demand sectors have positioned us well for continued growth in 2025.Our priorities for the remainder of this year are firmly set on achieving positive cash flow, sustaining our strong gross margin profile and expanding our market reach through ongoing innovation and strategic collaborations.We are confident in our ability to leverage the expanding electrification trend, and deliver meaningful long-term value to our shareholders.Thank you everyone for joining us today, to review this historical quarter for the company.We look forward to updating you again, next quarter.Operator: This is the conference operator.
