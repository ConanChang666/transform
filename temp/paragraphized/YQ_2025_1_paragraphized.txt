Thank you all for joining us on our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call.Before we begin, I would like to note that the financial information on the non-GAAP numbers in this release are presented on a continuing operations basis and in RMB, unless otherwise stated.Let me begin with our latest business updates.We are pleased to report a strong performance in the first quarter of 2025.This quarter has marked significant progress and innovation particularly with the successful trial and implementation of our AI-powered product upgrades facilitating teaching and learning efficiency by delivering intelligent adaptive solutions that enhance daily instructional decision making, providing more personalized learning experiences for students.During the quarter, we have seen a strong growth in both new contract acquisitions and the expansion of our existing customer base.

Our SaaS subscription business has risen as more schools and educational organizations recognize the value of our AI-powered solutions, showcased in strong retention rate and the increased adoption of our value-added offerings.In the first quarter of 2025, we recorded net revenues of RMB 21.7 million, representing a 15% decrease from the previous quarter last year, which was primarily due to the reduction in net revenues from district level projects as we prioritized our resources on school-based projects on a subscription model which generally have longer revenue recognition period.As we improved operational efficiency, operating expenses reduced by 42.6% compared to the same quarter last year, resulting in a 44.8% reduction in net loss on a GAAP basis.Looking ahead, we will remain vigilant in monitoring our financial performance and making strategic decisions to ensure a long-term success and sustainability of our business.And now let me go into more details.During the quarter, our district-level teaching and learning business remained steady, continuously contributing an important portion in revenue recognition.

Recently, we successfully supported Shanghai Minhang District, to launch a specialized generative intelligent agent cluster and demonstrated it at Shanghai Education Expo.The intelligent agent integrates universal large language models, leveraging vast real-time teaching and learning database in Minhang District, and integrating with the localized technology system, aiming to provide precise, contextualized support for nurses and educators so that we can transform education services from knowledge transmission through competency development.And following the successful launch of the new AI-powered solutions in Shanghai Minhang, we are confident that this offering will expand to other regions and serve as a model for potential partners pursuing transformative learning technologies.This initiative demonstrates our expertise in educational innovation by delivering adaptable high-value AI power solutions that enhance daily instructional decision-making, improve teaching and learning efficiency and promote high-quality regional education development.And our school-based subscription business has sustained a steady growth, driven by a year-over-year increase in newly subscribed students.This momentum underscores its strategic importance as a critical contributor and integral component of our overall revenue, which will continue to prioritize resource allocation.

And during the quarter, we have seen heightened demand and enthusiasm for our offerings in our partner schools, reflecting in a higher retention rate and increased adoption of our expandable value-added services.Over 90% of renewal customers opted to continue their subscriptions, with many expanding new service coverage.This strong retention and outstanding potential not only reinforce customer engagement and loyalty, but also safeguards the business for long-term sustainable growth.And as for our product and service offerings have been continuously upgraded with innovation, driving customer satisfaction and business growth by integrating AI into core teaching and learning scenarios, including lesson planning, in-class interaction, assignment design, automated grading, data-driven analysis and personalized learning recommendations.We aim to streamline teachers' workflows, empowering them with evidence-based decisions and individualized learning path for each student.Specifically, our intelligent voice and classroom monitoring functions are expected to boost classroom efficiency.

As smart companion for teachers, it helps teachers understand students' thinking process and learning states while providing teaching research support.Teachers can interact with the smart assistants in real time, analyzing multidimensional data such as students' response time, thinking patterns as well as learning trajectories, identifying group and individual differences with multi-tied learning analytics so that evidence-based teaching decisions can be made.Our intelligence solutions can customize classroom exercises and after school assignments for students based on personalized learning conditions, automatically grade them and generate dynamic error correction notebooks and provide customized problem-solving ideas and follow-up teaching suggestions.These advancements reduced teachers' workloads while enhancing students' learning efficiency and achievements.To date, we have conducted trials in over 50 schools, providing pet administrators with data-driven management tools covering the entire teaching scenario as well as demonstrating scalable ramification potentials of this model.And in terms of distribution channels, our market channel marketing efforts and strategic partnerships have further solidified our presence in high-growth markets.

We have consistently prioritized strategic market penetration by diversifying our distribution methods and fostering collaboration.By aligning product development with emerging educational trends and enhancing our distribution networks, we have improved product delivery and customer engagement, leveraging data analytics for targeted marketing and deeper customer insights.And now I will turn the call over to Lara to walk you through our latest financial performance.Thank you.Lara Zhao: Thanks, Sishi, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call.I will now walk you through our financial and operating results.
