On the call with me today are Kevin Mills, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Holmes, Chief Business Officer; and Lynn Zhao, Chief Financial Officer.I will now turn the call over to Kevin Mills.Kevin, you may begin.Kevin Mills: Thank you, operator.Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.Our revenue for Q1 was $4 million, a decrease of 20% over Q1 2024.

We recorded margins of 50.4%, a slight decrease from the 51% margins in Q1 2024.Our operating loss was $900,000 compared to an operating loss of $500,000 in Q1 2024.Overall, Q1 was a difficult start to the year.

Revenue came in lower than expected as we saw weakness in both our domestic and international businesses.While it’s impossible to know for sure, we feel the level of uncertainty froze a lot of deployments and routine business during Q1, resulting in lower revenues.The positive news from the quarter was that we saw the first green shoots in the industrial portion of our business, which Dave will detail in a few moments.As regards the outlook, the tariff situation has greatly complicated everyone’s lives.Socket, like everyone else, has a very international supply chain.In broad terms, we source about 30% of our materials from Mexico, 20% from Taiwan, and about 10% from China.

With the remaining 40% sourced in the U.S. So, the tariffs do impact us.We are working with our customers to minimize the impact as much as possible, especially with our international customers.From our customers’ point of view, we are a component of their solution and, therefore, the strength of their business is dependent on other elements in their supply chain.And this is particularly true for our many retail customers.So, we expect retail to remain at current levels until there is more certainty and people can make and execute plans.Thankfully, we expect most of the near-term industrial business to be in the U.S. and less likely to be impacted by the tariffs.

So, overall, we believe we will be able to continue to invest in our business and achieve positive EBITDA results for Q2, and believe we will be able to achieve profitable operating levels for the second half of the year.And, now, I’d like to turn the call over to Dave, who will provide more details on our progress in the industrial segment.Dave?Dave Holmes: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.As Kevin said, today, I’d like to highlight a few of the significant milestones that we achieved in Q1.We’ve invested a lot into our expansion into the industrial scanning and handheld computing markets over the last 2 years.

Those investments are starting to bear fruit in 2025.We’re seeing a lot of interest from a variety of customers in warehousing and logistics, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, energy, and construction.Widespread testing is underway, and we’ve received purchase orders for a long-term rollout from a Fortune 50 Tier 1 industrial customer.The ruggedized scanning market is large, and our entry into this space will help us diversify our business beyond retail.We also recently announced the launch of the Xtreme iXG and iXS Series, powered by iOS and featuring a fully integrated iPhone 16e.These devices are designed to serve as full-featured handheld computers, combining high-performance long-range barcode scanning with a connectivity, app ecosystem, and user-friendly interface of the iOS platform.

Together, these capabilities allow frontline workers to capture data more accurately, respond more decisively, and perform critical tasks with greater speed and confidence.These products put Socket Mobile into the $27 billion mobile handheld computing market.Our XtremeScan product is comprised of three different configurations, XtremeScan Case, XtremeScan, and XtremeScan Grip, all designed for iPhone.And, now, we’re offering models with iPhone 16e inside.XtremeScan is designed to enable iPhones to withstand harsh industrial conditions, offering robust scanning capabilities and military-grade durability.This opens the door to new customer segments that demand the ultimate performance in the most difficult environments.

Beyond new products, we’re also seeing our investments in our customer and developer experience having an impact with our partners.Alfred, our AI-powered developer support assistant, is helping our developers around the world with multilingual support to integrate our CaptureSDK into their apps, so they can enable best-in-class scanning capabilities into their mobile platforms. Our new product and technology investments will extend our reach and diversify our customer base.Ultimately, this will make us more sustainable and less dependent on retail, as we become a more complete data capture company.With that, I’ll turn it over to Lynn for more details on our financial results.Lynn?Lynn Zhao: Thanks, Dave.
