Because the fiscal year 2025 second quarter financials have not been released, we continue to be in a quiet period wherein we are limited in our ability to speak about the company's finances.In addition, as there is a pending proxy contest, we are under restrictions as to what we can speak about.As such, we will not be taking questions at the end of this earnings call.Once the annual meeting has been held, we expect to return to our usual earnings call format.To be blunt, Stadco had a very poor fiscal year 2025 first quarter ending June 30, 2024, resulting in large part from the terminated Votaw Precision Manufacturing acquisition incurring an operating loss of $1.3 million, primarily due to serious equipment problems. This was a direct result of our reducing maintenance and CapEx at Stadco to bare minimums starting during August 2023 in anticipation of the acquisition of Votaw as we had planned on immediately integrating Stadco into the Votaw facility.Since the termination of that acquisition, during April 2024, we have been playing catch-up in this area.

However, our efforts were too late to prevent the equipment failures that resulted in dramatic increases to Stadco's costs of production during this period, in some cases, nearly doubling the cost of production.Further affecting our loss was an accounting measure as we recognized an additional onetime non-cash $400,000 charge in fair market valuation of TechPrecision shares issued and recognized during April 2024 as the breakup fee from the termination of the Votaw acquisition.There were no additional shares issued.That change in fair value fell directly to our bottom-line for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.At the same time, our Ranor subsidiary continued to perform well in fiscal year 2025 first quarter as our newly joined CFO, Richard Romberg, will speak to shortly.For the quarter, Ranor revenue of $4.4 million compared to revenue of $4.5 million a year ago.

Fiscal year 2025 first quarter Stadco revenue was $3.6 million or a 21% increase versus the same quarter a year ago.For fiscal year 2025 first quarter, consolidated revenue was $8 million or 8% higher when compared to revenue of $7.4 million for the same period a year ago.Gross profit shrank due to higher production costs and under-absorbed overhead when compared to the same period a year ago, again, a direct result of the non-performing equipment at Stadco. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Richard Roomberg.Welcome aboard.Richard, please continue with the review of our first quarter results.Richard Roomberg: Thank you, Alex.

Great to be here and hello to everyone on the call.Reiterating what Alex stated, consolidated revenue for the fiscal year 2025 first quarter was $8 million or 8% higher when compared to $7.4 million in the same quarter a year ago.Projects executed in Q1 had overall relatively higher contract values as compared within the same period a year ago.Fiscal year 2025 first quarter consolidated cost of revenue was $7.7 million or 16% higher than the prior year period due primarily to higher production costs and under-absorbed overhead.As a result, fiscal year 2025 first quarter consolidated gross profit was $0.2 million or 66% lower compared to the same quarter a year ago as cost of revenue grew faster than revenue.Fiscal year 2025 first quarter SG&A expense increased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a change in fair value for the breakup fee in connection with the terminated Votaw acquisition during the quarter ended June 30th, 2024, and was roughly flat, excluding the change in fair value when compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Operating loss was $1.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 as higher Stadco operating losses and the Votaw acquisition breakup fee more than offset flat operating income at Ranor for the quarter ended June 30th, 2024.Fiscal year 2025 first quarter interest expense increased by approximately $40,000 due to higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates under our revolver loan.There was $2.8 million of outstanding debt under the revolver loan as of June 30th, 2024, approximately the same as March 31st, 2024.Fiscal year 2025 first quarter net loss was $1.5 million.The company maintained a full valuation allowance of its deferred taxes.

In summary, fiscal year 2025 first quarter results were primarily driven by the Stadco operating losses and the additional fee for the Votaw acquisition.Moving on to our financial position.Cash provided by operating activities was $0.1 million and cash used by financing activities was $0.2 million, and the company continued to pay down principal on its long-term debt.Our total debt was $7.5 million as of June 30th, 2024 as compared to $7.6 million as of March 31st, 2024.Cash balances as of June 30, 2024, was approximately $45,000 compared to approximately $138,000 as of March 31st, 2024.Working capital was negative as of June 30, 2024, as our previously classified long-term debt is currently classified as current because of debt covenant violations.

With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Alex.Alex Shen: Thank you, Richard.Customer confidence remains high as our consolidated backlog was $41.2 million as of June 30, 2024.We expect to deliver our strong backlog over the course of the next one to three fiscal years with gross margin expansion.We will continue to focus on tactical execution and risk mitigation, driving both subsidiaries to fully comprehend, successfully manage, and successfully meet customer expectations, enabling continuous recapture and continuous retention of customer confidence.We can all clearly see the positive results of this focus, evidenced by the continued high customer confidence, which enables us to maintain a strong backlog.

We remain highly focused on cash management, a critical piece of risk mitigation and continue to manage and control expenses, capital expenditures, customer advances, progress billings, and final invoicing at shipment.We have maintained two sequential quarters of positive operating cash flow.As Richard noted, our debt has been reclassified as current or due in less than one year.For those on the call who may not be very familiar with our company, TechPrecision is a custom manufacturer of precision large-scale fabricated components and precision large-scale machined metal structural components.The components that we manufacture are customer designed.We sell to customers in two main industry sectors, defense and precision industrial markets.

TechPrecision is proud and honored to serve the United States Defense industry, specifically naval submarine manufacturing through our Ranor subsidiary and military aircraft manufacturing through our Stadco subsidiary.We aim to secure and maintain enduring partnerships with our customers.Overall, in both the Ranor and the Stadco subsidiaries, we continue to see meaningful opportunities in our defense sector as evidenced by the strength of our backlog.We are encouraged by the prospects for growing our revenue and increasing profitability in future quarters.Thank you and have a good day.End of Q&A: Thank you.

This does conclude today's conference.You may disconnect and thank you for your participation.
