With that, I'll turn the call over to our Portfolio Manager, Kevin Yonon.Kevin?Kevin Yonon: Thank you, Jonathan.During the quarter ended March 31, US loan market performance weakened versus the prior quarter.US loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar LSTA US Leveraged Loan Index, decreased from 97.33% of par as of December 31 to 96.31% of par as of March 31.According to LCD, during the quarter, there were some pricing dispersion, with BB rated loan prices decreasing 82 basis points, B rated loan prices decreasing 134 basis points, and CCC rated loan prices decreasing 211 basis points on average.

While the 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index decreased to 0.82% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 0.91% at the December, we note that the default rate, including various forms of liability management exercises, which are not captured in this cited default rate, remain at an elevated level of 4.31%.Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as a percentage of loans with prices below 80% of par, ended the quarter at 3.21% compared to 3.02% at the end of 2024.During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, US leveraged loan primary market issuance, excluding amendments and repricing transactions, was $141.1 billion, representing a 2% decrease versus the quarter ended March 31, 2024.This was driven by lower opportunistic activity, including refinancings and the funding of dividends, partly offset by higher non-refinancing issuance, including M&A and LBO activity versus the prior year comparable quarter.At the same time, US loan fund inflows, as measured by Lipper, were approximately $1.94 billion for the quarter ended March 31.We continue to focus on portfolio management strategies designed to maximize our long-term total return, and as a permanent capital vehicle, we historically have been able to take a longer-term view towards our investment strategy.
