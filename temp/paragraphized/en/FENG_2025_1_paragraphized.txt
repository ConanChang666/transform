Actually, in Q1 2025, our advertising business faced severe challenges, but our team responded actively, showing strong resilience.First, while the number of existing clients remained steady, they spending – their spending became more cautious, reducing average revenue per client.To address this, we focused on attracting new clients and their revenue grew significantly, balancing the decline from existing clients.Second, some industries had seasonal fluctuations.For example, alcohol advertising dropped sharply, but we expanded quickly in finance, e-commerce, consumer goods and electronics, achieving good progress.Also, certain clients had strong demand, but their projects required high investment and cost.

So we focused on refining our creative content resources and events to increase our pricing premium.Looking to Q2, advertisers are still cautious with marketing spending, but are improving compared to Q1.Based on market research, advertisers are focusing more on brand value and media influence.We will continue to use our strength as a leading Internet media platform, offering high-quality content and campaigns to create value for clients.Besides growing new industries and domestic clients, we are also exploring marketing partnerships with overseas companies in China.Our team is dedicated to staying competitive in this market.
