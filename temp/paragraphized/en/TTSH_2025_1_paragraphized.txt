Since these external factors are largely out of our control, we choose to focus on the things we can influence, centered around providing an exceptional experience to our customers and effectively managing our expenses.Our overall comparable store sales decreased by 4% during the quarter.However, it is worth noting that we saw an increase in the volume of tile that we sold during the quarter.The increase in the tile volume sold was driven by our recent initiatives, which included the expansion of entry-level competitively priced products.We also added our Arbor collection of high-quality luxury vinyl tile products last fall that has helped bolster our LVT offering.By direct sourcing this line, we were able to offer this collection to our customers at attractive price points.

Additionally, we saw nice volume increases in large format tiles, benefited from the addition of engineered hardwood and laminate products to our assortment.Overall, our assortment is in fantastic shape as we move through our spring selling season.While our purchasing team has done a great job bringing us to this point, we still have work ahead of us as tariff policies evolve.It is important to note that we have made significant strides over the last five years and have a much more diversified supplier base that spans across over 25 countries.We continuously evaluate alternative sources of supply to ensure we are able to maintain a high-quality offering at attractive price points for our customers.

Additionally, we carry more inventory than the typical flooring retailer, which gives us time to maneuver as tariff policies evolve.We have also made inroads building partnerships with tile manufacturers based in the United States in recent years and are proud to carry a robust line of domestically manufactured tile.We believe our seasoned purchasing team, with a deep track record of managing our robust network of suppliers across the globe, has us in a good position to help us maintain a competitive advantage in this area.Our team continues to collaborate with leading designers to expand our assortment of products that cater to the design community.Over the years, we have forged partnerships with reputable brands, including Annie Selke, Nikki Chu, Jeffrey Alan Marks, Laura Ashley, and Morris & Co. These design partnerships help us create unique tile products that are one of a kind and exclusive to The Tile Shop.Last month, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Alison Victoria.

We have enjoyed working with Alison to develop beautiful design options that feature contemporary color combinations and distinctive details that embody Alison's design style.In closing, I am encouraged that these changes we have made to our assortment contributed to the increase in tile volumes sold during the first quarter.While we continue to navigate the near-term challenges that affect our industry, we are focused on maintaining the best assortment of tile products in the industry, giving our customers the ability to design a space that differentiates their home, and providing exceptional service to all customers who visit our stores.With that, I will now hand the call over to Mark Davis.Mark Davis: Thanks, Cabell.Good morning, everyone.

First quarter sales to comparable stores decreased by 4% due to lower levels of store traffic.It is important to note that 2024 included an extra day during the first quarter due to it being a leap year.We estimate the additional day resulted in sales of approximately $1 million during the first quarter of 2024 based on our average daily sales throughout the period.As Cabell mentioned earlier, our tile volume sales improved during the first quarter of 2025 when compared to the same period during the prior year.We have seen an increase in sales driven by the products we have added to our assortment over the last year, and many of these products carry a lower average selling price.It is noteworthy that we have been able to maintain our average ticket values as we have mixed into products which carry a lower average selling price by increasing our tile volume sales.

Our gross margin rate during the first quarter was 66%, which represented a 20 basis point increase compared to the first quarter of 2024.Improvement in gross margin rate was largely driven by a decrease in inventory write-offs and partially offset by an increase in customer delivery mix.First quarter SG&A expense of $57.9 million was basically in line with the prior year first quarter.However, there were some noteworthy puts and takes.This included a $700,000 decrease in depreciation, $400,000 savings stemming from the closure of our distribution center in New Jersey last fall, and a $400,000 reduction of benefits costs.These were partially offset by a $700,000 increase in marketing, a $300,000 increase in training, and a $300,000 increase in IT expenses.

Following the end of the quarter, we were able to sublease the distribution space in New Jersey through the third quarter of 2026, which coincides with the time our lease of the distribution space expires.We anticipate receiving $2 million of subleasing income during this time frame and expect approximately half of this benefit will be reflected as a reduction of our SG&A expenses over the balance of 2025, with the remaining balance providing a benefit during the first three quarters of 2026.During the first quarter, we generated $10 million of operating cash flow and added $6.1 million to our cash balance, which grew to $27.1 million at the end of the quarter.We believe we are well positioned to navigate the challenges of the current environment with a great assortment, strong balance sheet, and a talented team.With that, Cabell and I are happy to take any questions.Operator: Thank you.
