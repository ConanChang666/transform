Prior to commencing, I would like to kind of remind all attendees that the financial information referenced in this release are presented on a continuing operations basis, and all figures are denominated in RMB unless explicitly specified otherwise.In the first quarter of 2025, we reported net revenue of RMB 487.6 million and net income of RMB 75.2 million, marking our sixteenth consecutive profitable quarter, and an encouraging start to the year that reinforces our confidence in delivering sustained growth throughout 2025.While net revenue remained relatively stable, our continued profitability and disciplined execution reflects the underlying resilience of our business model.Net income margin reached 15.4% supported by effective cost optimization and ongoing operational efficiency improvements.

Meanwhile, our financial fundamentals remain robust.This quarter marked our seventh consecutive period of positive operating cash flow underpinned by sound execution and prudent cash management.Looking ahead, we will continue to refine our business mix concentrating on high-margin, high potential areas to reinforce structural flexibility and long-term resilience.On the product front, we continue to deepen and diversify our course portfolio.We refined our core subject areas, while extending into adjacent domains such as wellness and lifestyle, aligned with increasingly diverse needs of lifelong learners.Driven by our course diversification strategy, this quarter's total enrollment reached over 179,000 (sic) [ 169,000 ] also supported by meaningful improvements in learner engagement and retention.

Technology also remains central to our strategy.This quarter, we further advanced the digital transformation of cooperations by embedding AI tools that enhance curriculum precision and boost learner engagement.Now let's turn to the performance of each of our major course programs. In the first quarter of 2025, degree and diploma post-secondary programs contributed 9.7% of total revenue.This sector has experienced a moderated trajectory and our celebrated scale back investments has allowed us to reallocate resources towards high-growth opportunities more effectively.Going forward, we will continue to monitor macro education trends and demographic shifts closely, ensuring our approach remains agile and responsive to evolving conditions.The sector encompassing interest-based programs, professional skills development and professional certification preparation, accounted for a substantial 78.2% of our total revenue, with interest-driving courses emerging as a fundamental pillar.

Unlocking the full potential of interest learning among middle-aged and senior learners remains a central strategic priority.In this area, we have remained steadfast in pursuing a clear future-oriented strategy rooted in openings, integration and innovation while deepening our initiatives across multiple fronts.First, we have embraced a partnership-driven approach to amplify value creation.As China's aging population expands, the senior consumer market is drawing increased participation from diverse industries, including consumer brands, health care service providers and traditional media.This convergence presents significant opportunities for core sector collaboration.Following last year's successful partnership with Beijing TV, we established a new cooperation with Hunan TV's Happy Shopping platform this quarter, leveraging its broad consumer reach and brand influence.

Second, we have further strengthened our hyper delivery model to meet the evolving needs of older learners.For this demographic, education is not only about acquiring knowledge.It is equally about social participation and emotional fulfillment.To address this need, we have adopted primarily online supplemented by offline hybrid model that offers both flexibility and depth.This model has proven especially effective in boosting learner retention and satisfaction.Notably, our curated study tour with integrated education content with culture travel has been particularly well received for their immersive and differentiated value.

At the same time, we are deepening our cross-sector collaboration by partnering with galleries and museums to codevelop cultural resonant experiences, further strengthening engagement within the senior segment.Third, we have refined our curriculum design with a self-developed assist framework, which is answer, comment, supervisor and study to fuel ongoing growth and ensure learner success.This dual teacher model while pairs academic mentors and learning facilitators makes our courses more assessable, engaging and outcome-driven.Leveraging this collaborative learning system, we have attained 98% course competition (sic) [ completion ] rate among new students and 14% increase in knowledge retention, underscoring its effectiveness in delivering substantial educational outcomes.Beyond academic innovation, social mission remains integral to our strategy.Each year, we organize nearly 100 free public interest activities, ensure elderly individuals with cultural or intellectual operations access meaningful learning experiences.

We view this not only as an expression of corporate responsibility, but as a long-term investment in brand trust and mission element.Recent policy developments further reinforce our confidence.With government's focus on stimulating the domestic consumption and expanding service-oriented sectors, including cultural, tourism and education align closely with our strategic direction.Targeted initiatives and fiscal incentives for innovation in community-based and lifelong learning programs affirm that we are operating in the right space at the right time with ample room to scale, lead and grow.Taken together, these efforts reflect our holistic and forward-looking approach to lifelong learning.Today's adult learners are increasingly value conscious, seeking premium, immersive and social engaging experiences.

This shift affirms our early position and highlights the long-term potential of adult learning economy.Moving forward, we will continue enhancing our offerings, strengthening ecosystem integration and deepen engagement, ensuring we remain well positioned to lead this evolving sector.While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the impact on our business has been limited given our domestic focus.Nonetheless, we remain vigilant proactively managing risks while staying alert to new opportunities.Looking ahead, we will continue strengthening our core capabilities, expanding our core offerings, embracing [Technical Difficulty] disciplined focus on value creation.We are confident this approach will deliver sustainable long-term returns for shareholders and meaningful learning outcomes for our students.
