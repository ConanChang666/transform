Please refer to the SEC filings and the earnings press release for a full discussion of risks and uncertainties.Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.Reconciliation of these measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures are available on our earnings release and on our website.With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.Ajay Khare: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.I’m Ajay Khare, the newly appointed CEO of Aeries Technology.

Many of you know me from my previous role as Chief Operating and Revenue Officer over the past 10 years here at Aeries.I’m honored to step into this role and lead the company into a new phase of transformation and growth.I would like to take this opportunity to appreciate outgoing CEO, Sudhir Panikassery’s leadership, which has set a strong foundation for our growth.I am also pleased to announce that Daniel Webb has been appointed as our Chief Financial Officer, in addition to continuing his role as Chief Investment Officer.Daniel brings extensive experience in public market and investment banking.We believe his strategic insight will be instrumental in strengthening our financial discipline and ensuring that we deploy resources effectively to achieve our long-term objectives.

Today, I would want to focus on three key areas: number one, strategic focus on profitable growth.We have realigned our business model to concentrate on high-value, long-term engagement with our core North American clientele, accounts that represent over 93% of our revenue.By exiting non-core segments such as Middle East, we are sharpening our focus on transformation-led partnerships.This approach is designed to not only enhance our service quality, but also support our strategy of achieving profitable growth on both cash flow and adjusted EBITDA basis.Number two, robust cost discipline and financial health.Our recent cost optimization efforts have already delivered significant benefits.

This quarter, we further eliminated significant SG&A costs and annual expenses, a saving that is expected to positively impact our bottom line starting next quarter.Combined with our disciplined approach to resource allocation, these measures are designed to put us on a clear path to being cash flow positive for foreseeable future.Lastly, innovation and AI-driven transformation, the industry is evolving from legacy cost-saving models towards transformation-led engagements, our global capability center, GCC model, remains central to our growth strategy.In parallel, we have observed that our AI practice is gaining traction.We now offer a complementary AI assessment to help clients analyze optimal areas for AI automation to drive process optimization and operational efficiency.Some recent examples of AI projects we have done include helping a telecom client achieve 90% accuracy in churn prediction.

And in healthcare space, our automation solution for IT support has reduced human intervention by 40%.We believe these initiatives not only differentiate us in the marketplace, but also create tangible value for our clients.In summary, with a strong leadership in place, our focused strategy on high-value engagements and disciplined cost management we believe Aeries is well positioned to drive sustainable profitable growth.We remain committed to excellence and delivering value to our stakeholders as we navigate an evolving market landscape.Now, I will turn the call over to Daniel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.Daniel Webb: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.

As mentioned earlier, I am Daniel Webb, newly appointed as CFO, while continuing in my role as Chief Investment Officer.I am excited to share our financial highlights and strategic outlook for fiscal years 2025 and 2026.For the third fiscal quarter of 2025, our key financial metrics are as follows.
