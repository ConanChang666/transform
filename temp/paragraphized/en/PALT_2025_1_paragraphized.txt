On this call, we will refer to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure that when used in combination with GAAP results, provides us and our investors with additional analytical tools to understand our operations.For adjusted EBITDA, we’ve provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings press release, which has been posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ipm.com.And with that, I’d like to introduce IPM’s Chief Executive Officer, Jason Katz.Jason Katz: Thank you, Kara Cara, and good afternoon, everyone.We greatly appreciate you taking the time to join us on today’s call.As previously disclosed in January 2025, we completed our acquisition of Newtek Technologies Solutions, Inc. or NTS, from NewtekOne, Inc., and the sale of our Paltalk, Camfrog and Vumber applications and certain assets and liabilities related to such applications to Meteor Mobile Holdings, Inc., which are referred to as the transferred assets.

The first quarter of 2025 was transformational for IPM following the closing of our acquisition of NTS, which focused our business on the rapidly growing cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity sectors.Today, more than ever, cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity are critical to protecting sensitive data, ensuring business continuity, and securing a digital economy in an era of growing cyber threats.We have an exciting opportunity to build upon NTS’s historical achievements moving forward as a standalone integrated service company.After my remarks, our CFO, Kara Jenny will give a summary of our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.Following our prepared remarks, we’ll move into the Q&A portion and answer any questions that were submitted prior to this call.Since the closing of the transactions in the beginning of the year, we have successfully integrated our operations and serviced our existing customers without an interruption.

Moving forward, we believe we are now well positioned to grow the company through the expansion of our services offerings to existing legacy NTS customers, while cross-selling our ManyCam software and varying new services to our historical web hosting customer base.This should lead to further growth and enhancement of operational efficiencies, all focused on driving stockholder value.I would now like to provide an overview of our IT and cloud-based solutions to give you more insight into our new business.Our managed IT security services provide clients with ongoing management and support of their IT systems and services under a subscription or contract-based model.Such services include, among other things, proactive monitoring, regular system maintenance, comprehensive cybersecurity management, data backup and disaster recovery, as well as help desk support for users.We sell and provide a range of services across five core areas.

Additionally, we believe there is potential for merger and acquisition opportunities to further scale our growth.We look forward to growing the business and building a healthy pipeline of prospective and new customers.We enter this new chapter for IPM with a strong balance sheet highlighted by $9.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt, which when coupled with the potential earn-out from the sale of the transferred assets puts us in a strong position to execute on our business plans and further transform IPM.

Additionally, effective May 8, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan for up to $400,000 of the company’s outstanding common stock, which plan expires on the one-year anniversary of such date.Shares may be repurchased from time-to-time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with the federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 programs, and the stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time.The actual timing number and value of shares repurchased will be determined by a committee of the Board of Directors at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, alternative investment opportunities, and other corporate considerations.In regards to our patent litigation, on August 29, 2024, jury awarded us $65.7 million in a jury verdict in connection with the lawsuit against WebEx Communications, Cisco Webex LLC and Cisco Systems in the District Court for the Western District of Texas.On October 8, 2024, an order granting a motion for final judgment was entered into by the court in connection with the lawsuit.The final judgment was entered in our favor in the amount of the award and started the time for filing any post-trial motions or appeal.

The exact amount of the award proceeds to be received by us will be determined based on a number of factors and will reflect the deduction of significant litigation-related expenses, including legal fees.Consequently, we estimate that we would receive no more than one-third of the gross proceeds in connection with the award subject to post-trial proceedings, including any potential appellate proceedings by Cisco. We have not recorded any gained contingency in connection with the award.Now I’d like to pass it to Kara for a financial summary of the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.Kara Jenny: Thank you, Jason.Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $5.5 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.This increase was primarily driven by new revenue streams as a result of the acquisition of NTS, which closed on January 2, 2025.
