Now let's open for Q&A.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sijie Lin from CICC.Sijie Lin: [Interpreted] Could you please share the performance of RevPAR since Q2 and provide outlook on RevPAR for the full year?Haijun Wang: [Interpreted] In Q1, the overall market experienced some volatility.There were multiple factors to be considered, including weather conditions, macroeconomic impacts, they're all affecting travel demand.Our RevPAR decreased by 7.2% year-over-year and also OCC and ADR were showing varying degrees of decline year-over-year as well.

Entering Q2, we observed a continued divergence in market demand.While there were the recovery of business travel, but it remains quite uncertain to some extent, leisure travel demand has demonstrated some notable resilience.During the Labor Day holiday, both pricing and occupancy performed quite strongly, exceeding prior year levels.So overall, we anticipate there might be some easing of RevPAR pressure in Q2 when compared to Q1.And as for our view on the full year RevPAR performance, it is still remaining consistent with the beginning of the year.And RevPAR still faces considerable uncertainty given the ongoing market volatility.

However, in terms of our operations, we will not just blindly engage in price competitions with the homogenized products in the market.What we will do is to continue to adhere to Atour's differentiated experience advantages to seize the core revenue opportunities, and we are going to adopt a more balanced and refined revenue management strategy in terms of both ADR and OCC so that we can continuously build the long-term brand value of Atour.Operator: Next, we have Ronald Leung from Bank of America.Ronald Leung: [Interpreted] Could you please share your view on the new signings momentum and also new hotel openings for the full year of 2025?Haijun Wang: [Interpreted] Thank you, Ronald.Let me answer your question.

In the first quarter, we remained positive signing momentum amid industry-wide pressure from homogeneous supply Atour, we solidified our unique market positioning through our differentiated brand strategy and distinctive experiential strength.This has continuously drawn the attention of high-quality franchisees.In addition, against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, we have clearly observed along the way that compared to other investment channels, the hotel industry offers still a relatively stable cash flow returns and a more robust business model.So despite some RevPAR volatility, the premium property rental cost still is remaining in a relatively low range with improved availability, and that makes the overall returns attractive in the long term.As a result to that, mature hotel franchisees are still remaining confident and are willing to seize opportunities to capture that long-term growth potential of premium brands in the future market.As for new openings, in the first quarter of this year, we opened 121 hotels, continuing that high-quality expansion trend since we had last year.

Based upon that, we maintain our full year opening guidance of 500 new openings and have full confidence in achieving this goal, steadily advancing toward our strategic objective of reaching 2,000 premier hotels by the year-end.Also based on our strategic goal of 2,000 premier hotels, we will impose stricter requirements on quality from multiple dimensions, including signings, openings and operation to ensure that our hotel numbers grow with quality so that every hotel can provide users with a consistently high-quality experience.Thank you.Operator: Next, we have Dan Chee from Morgan Stanley.Dan Chee: [Interpreted] My question is related to the company's retail business.We saw retail business revenue growth in the first quarter was outstanding at 67% year-on-year.

Previously, the company guided full year retail revenue of no less than 35% growth.I would like to ask the management about any update to the full year revenue guidance on this business and any strategic plan for retail in the coming period?Thank you.Haijun Wang: [Interpreted] Thank you, Dan.In first quarter, we seized the key marketing opportunities of the Spring Festival.Also, we gained advantage from that continuous popularity of the Deep Sleep series products.

Our retail business achieved a year-on-year growth of over 70% in GMV.Meanwhile, we can see that the sales trend of the new products we launched in March, namely the Deep Sleep Thermal regulating Comfort Pro 2.0 summer season is also very strong.Looking at the full year, though the market competition is still remaining intense.However, because of our continuous enhancement of Atour Planet product offerings as well as the brand awareness, we are quite confident in the performance of our upcoming product launches, also the major promotional campaigns we have in our plans.Based upon this outlook, we are now raising our full year retail revenue growth forecast to 50% year-over-year.

Meanwhile, despite there are still some RevPAR uncertainties, the strong performance of our retail business led us to increase our group's full year revenue growth guidance to the range of in between 25% to 30% year-over-year.In the future, Atour Planet will continue to focus on the deep sleep domain, enhance product R&D, improve our product quality, also consolidate our moat in supply chain to achieve higher quality and sustainable development of both the products and our brand.Thank you.Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Wei Liu from Citics.Wei Liu: [Interpreted] We noticed that you had just announced dividend and share buyback program.Could you share some thoughts of the overall considerations behind these initiatives?

Haijun Wang: [Interpreted] Thank you, Wei.Well, like we said before, we remain committed to creating long-term value and rewarding our shareholders' trust and support through concrete actions.So in addition to the dividend, we have also officially announced today a 3-year share repurchase program with a total amount not exceeding USD 400 million.Regarding the dividend, we will continue implementing the 3-year dividend plan established last year, under which the annual cumulative dividend payout will be no less than 50% of the net income in the previous fiscal year.That's why this year, as we announced, our first dividend distribution totals approximately USD 58 million, representing about 1/3, 33% of the prior fiscal year's net income.And moving forward into the future, we will implement a comprehensive shareholder return program by combining dividend payout and share buyback together.

While ensuring the company's stable and normal capital operations, we will actively consider various shareholder return methods in line with actual business conditions to enhance shareholder yield and enable all shareholders to share in the company's growth achievements.Operator: Our next question comes from Lydia Ling from Citi.Lydia Ling: [Interpreted] Could you provide an update on the progression of your upscale of brands?And also, we noticed the launch of some new products across both the upper scale and also mid-scale brands.So could you elaborate more on the strategies for them?Haijun Wang: [Interpreted] Thank you, Lydia.

And in the upper mid-scale hotel segment, as I mentioned earlier, our Atour 3 and Atour 4 series will coexist, and they will jointly shape our next-generation upper mid-scale hotel portfolio so that it not only reaches the choices of franchisees, but also meet the diverse accommodation needs of consumers, also to further expand the market coverage so as to consolidating Atour's leading position in the upper mid-scale market.And as for the mid-scale hotel segment, as we announced earlier, we are going to upgrade our Atour Light 3.0 to the Atour Light 3.3 version, and that has undergone comprehensive upgrades in multiple dimensions, including experience, product texture and business functions.And we are adopting more modular design applications in order to adapt to more diverse properties as well as enlarging the room areas.We are going to continue to be committed to creating a higher premium and cost controllable investment model by offering those lasting profitability and excellent returns so that we can provide with the franchisees with more investment options.Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session.I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Luke for any additional or closing remarks.
