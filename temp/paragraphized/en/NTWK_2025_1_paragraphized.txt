In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we continue to build on the strong foundation that we laid throughout the 2024 fiscal year.We achieved profitability in the first quarter along with a 3% growth in total net revenues, primarily driven by a 26% increase in recurring subscription support revenues.This growth demonstrates an important shift in our revenue mix, relying less on large onetime license fees, which are relatively unpredictable in nature and can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.And more on our SaaS products, which generate revenue at a more consistent and predictable rate, thanks to the recurring nature of this segment.We continue to strategically invest in the growth of our business, which was demonstrated in our increased selling, general and admin expenses in the first quarter.Our growth strategy is focused on two key initiatives that we believe will position the company at the forefront of our dynamic industry that is constantly evolving to meet shifting customer demands.

The innovation and integration of AI into our leading product suite and strategic geographic expansion into both new and existing markets.During the first quarter, we announced a new Transcend platform, an AI-powered digital retail and asset finance solution for automotive and equipment OEMs, auto captives, commercial lenders, dealers, brokers and financial institutions.This platform unifies NETSOL's product suite under one brand, while offering a robust set of solutions that showcases our commitment to harnessing the transformative potential of AI.Like many leading companies, we believe that AI is the future for technology, and as such, it was imperative for us to redefine our product suite to better meet the demand of our growing client base.This transition represents a key strategic milestone for our business as we enter the next era of technology, where AI is at the forefront.We remain committed to investing in the innovation and integration of AI into our products as well as adding the best talent available to us as we further these initiatives.

AI is prevalent across our entire product suite with one example being the interaction that customers have using our Transcend retail platform.With the help of AI, buyers can chat with the digital customer support agent in real time to browse new vehicles, financing options, promotions and vehicle builds, providing options and insights to find the best vehicle and financing options to meet the customer specific needs.AI is optimizing online car buying from discovery to final sale, and we remain committed to innovating integrating this technology across our product line.Growth in the United States continues to be a top priority, and we are making encouraging progress as we [indiscernible] this region.In the first quarter, we announced a 5-year, $16 million contract with a major automaker to revolutionize the digital car buying experience in the U.S. through Transcend retail.Our omnichannel digital retail platform that contributes to our recurring revenues.

In addition to this contract, we have also been engaged in a long-standing agreement with MINI USA to leverage our cross-sell retail platform in their online purchasing operations.Over the lifetime of this contract, MINI has achieved a 33% increase in conversion rate from lead to sales.We are performing in our established markets as well, thanks to renewed opportunity for growth in regions like APAC, where we already have a leading market share.During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we signed an expansion agreement with a major automaker in China, a longstanding metro partner increasing the total contract value to over $30 million and demonstrating our strength of customer relationships and ongoing demand for our products from Tier 1 names in the auto industry.As Najeeb mentioned last quarter, the stickiness of our customer base also complements our geographic expansion.We have developed a strong base of loyal recurring customers.

Over the last 4 fiscal years, we have increased our customer retention rate from approximately 90% in 2021, to just below 95% in 2024, demonstrating the superior performance and reliability of our products and services.Before I hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Roger Almond, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the enhanced strength of our balance sheet in recent quarters, which Roger will elaborate on his prepared remarks.As we've committed to execute on our growth strategy, we have also significantly enhanced our liquidity and strength of our balance sheet.Notably, our cash and cash equivalents have grown to $24.5 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.4 million compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of approximately $8 million since the first quarter of 2024.This enhanced liquidity provides us with the flexibility to strategically invest in the growth of our business from product innovation, to geographic expansion and allows us to pursue the many opportunities that continue to emerge in the market.Overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results as we continue to build on the progress that we made in fiscal 2024.
