[112.06-115.76] Number two, bank's performance was driven by...
[115.96-125.82] Continued strength in fee and treasury gains, which made up the decrease in the interest income and the increase in operating expenses.

[1270.52-1277.62] 可能今年我们的交易额可能会是10%到15%
[1277.62-1289.12] 所以,如果有更加保守的答案,我们将计算20%左右
[1289.12-1299.32] 交易额今年将达到12.5亿元
[1299.32-1301.72] 这是我们目前的预测
[1301.72-1309.72] 我们的调整预测额将达到1.03%
[1309.72-1313.02] 两费比去年低
[1313.02-1317.02] 但原本预测额可能会增加一点
[1317.02-1319.02] 然后
[1319.02-1321.02] 还有一个问题
[1321.02-1324.02] 从JT Morgan
[1324.02-1330.02] 他想知道我们的测试质素问题
[1330.02-1339.02] 因为有些政策的制定性
[1339.02-1343.02] 会否影响我们的小企业
[1343.02-1346.02] 对我们的生产
[1346.02-1348.02] 所以
[1348.02-1349.02] 在进步前
[1349.02-1353.02] 我们的测试质素会否影响我们的生产质素
[1353.02-1356.02] 那么,这些问题是什么
[1356.02-1365.02] 在建筑物市场上的生产质素方面
[1365.02-1369.02] 我们的计划是
[1369.02-1373.02] 我们的贷款要求
[1373.02-1376.02] 在建筑物贷款或发展贷款上
[1376.02-1379.02] 对房地产的执dd占入 是增加几乎合理的
[1379.02-1382.02] 我们对这些营让以的生产质素

[1404.02-1405.02] 国家而 151 revolution
[1405.02-1416.86] 到现在为止,我们没有看到任何的变化在地区市场中的小型玩家的物品问题上。
[1416.86-1424.50] 所以我们对此问题没有特别的关注。
[1424.50-1439.50] 只要市场仍然保持稳定,经济发展仍然保持稳定,这并不是问题。
[1439.50-1451.06] 所以到现在为止,我们的投资质素仍然没有任何的变化。
[1451.06-1454.06] 您可以看到,根据我们的...
[1454.50-1460.94] 我们的投资质素的风险仍然是很稳定的。
[1460.94-1466.10] 好的,谢谢你,Annie。
[1466.10-1472.66] 目前,我们的投资质素仍然没有任何问题。
[1472.66-1480.06] 还有一个问题是来自Wing Huang的Government Secs。
[1480.06-1484.06] Wing想知道我们的...
[1484.06-1496.02] 构思pling預测的期限是何收益?
[1496.18-1499.26] competitiveness is clearly in force.
[1499.26-1505.90] But you also know that there are factors that are related to the期限.
[1505.90-1509.98] 기를 beto to market in the future period later beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
[1509.98-1511.30] Under Sithar咏其uks keep protecting itself when it closes.
[1511.30-1511.94] Private in fact will need to come back in the shorter понятно ume pwih be more drink.
[1511.94-1512.38] E�� kje lstou说你复形兴.
[1512.38-1512.70] Bul anim robot spring stage over here in second level.
[1512.70-1518.92] 我们预测的收益会在中间的一个数字中间增长5-6%
[1518.92-1525.62] 我们记录了去年达到的很强硬的收益率达到9%
[1525.62-1531.00] 这也因为今年增长的趋势
[1531.00-1535.34] 而影响了我们的收益率
[1535.34-1540.84] 但是我们的大型车辆会更加正常化
[1540.84-1549.06] 尤其是SME和AVEX的收益率
[1549.06-1560.34] 我们会追踪 export sector和地区经济增长的趋势
[1560.34-1565.32] 在很大型的收益率上
[1565.32-1570.58] 我们会持续持续的预测
[1570.58-1572.78] 今年收益率达到的收益率
[1572.78-1580.10] 会达到6-7%
[1580.10-1584.12] 这年后政府的收益率达到的收益率
[1584.12-1588.92] 会变得不太好
[1588.92-1592.86] 所以今年收益率的大型车辆
[1592.86-1595.30] 主要来自我们的
[1595.30-1598.26] SME的市场
[1598.26-1601.44] 会增长4%
[1601.44-1602.80] 而AVEX的收益率
[1602.80-1604.76] 尤其是在市场中的收益率
[1604.76-1608.62] 可以增长到11-12%
[1608.62-1610.92] 根据预测
[1610.92-1613.68] 美国的收益率会上升
[1613.68-1617.24] 这就是收益的价值
[1617.24-1621.14] 所以这就是我们的两个主要的构图
[1621.14-1623.84] 帮助我们增长我们的收益率
[1625.30-1627.10] 好的 谢谢Annie
[1627.10-1630.68] 我们今年收益率
[1630.68-1637.08] 主要是由SME和AVEX来推动
[1637.08-1643.22] 我们认为这也会帮助增长我们的收益率
[1643.22-1647.32] 所以SME的收益率会达到4%
[1647.32-1651.42] 而AVEX的收益率会达到11-12%
[1651.42-1653.46] 然后
[1655.30-1659.40] 有一个问题是从Mandy Lin
[1659.40-1661.70] Fubang的问题
[1661.70-1666.06] Mandy想知道我们的缩幅增长
[1666.06-1668.10] 我们的缩幅增长
[1668.10-1673.22] 预测是2025年到2025年
[1673.22-1675.02] 12.5 亿
[1675.02-1677.06] 这是我们预测
[1677.06-1679.62] 还有一个问题
[1679.62-1682.70] 来自我们的
[1682.70-1684.74] Long Outlook 预测
[1685.30-1688.30] 也能回答这个问题
[1688.30-1694.30] 另外一个问题是从Eric Shih
[1694.30-1702.30] 他想知道我们的资金支付问题
[1702.30-1710.30] 因为在最近几年内
[1710.30-1716.30] 我们的支付率是约50%左右
[1716.30-1722.30] 那么我们的2024年资金支付率
[1722.30-1728.30] 也有50%左右
[1728.30-1731.30] 另外
[1731.30-1732.30] 我们的资金支付率也有50%左右
[1732.30-1738.30] 即使我们对IRB方式进行接受
[1738.30-1740.30] 价值会上升
[1740.30-1744.30] 如果我们当选择了IRB方式
[1744.30-1749.30] 领域比例也会升
[1749.30-1754.30] 那我们的成本就会如何
[1754.30-1757.30] 然后我们将有何关系
[1757.30-1759.30] 我们的因素会 Grüster
[1759.30-1761.30] 我想再回答郑太老师的问题
[1761.30-1762.30] 所以 connectic σ
[1762.30-1773.36] あと我自己在问题 지문鑽選中讀到的 ٩晗 bunch 那第은
[1774.96-1783.30] VI abruptly 我 slavery 飯 z coworker
[1783.30-1784.24] 是的
[1784.24-1785.76] cover
[1786.60-1790.10] extinct
[1790.10-1793.34] 地图
[1793.34-1795.94] 14.8%
[1795.94-1797.06] so last year even
[1797.06-1800.26] outperformed the prior year's
[1800.26-1801.82] level and this year will be
[1801.82-1804.10] lower because the US dollar
[1804.10-1805.64] rate has gone down
[1805.64-1808.06] so we would project
[1808.06-1809.52] there will be 20% off
[1809.52-1810.84] than last year's peak
[1810.84-1813.90] this is the end of question
[1813.90-1816.04] to reply the prior
[1816.04-1818.10] swaps inquiry
[1818.10-1819.90] and talking about
[1819.90-1821.34] our dividend policy
[1821.34-1824.14] that as we would
[1824.14-1826.26] actually enter
[1826.26-1827.96] into the IRB model
[1827.96-1828.80] next year
[1828.80-1831.90] so I have to
[1831.90-1833.64] reiterate to this year
[1833.64-1835.60] our dividend policy
[1835.60-1837.02] would have to be
[1837.02-1838.64] maintained conservative
[1838.64-1840.80] that a 50%
[1840.80-1842.40] up
[1842.40-1844.28] payout ratio
[1844.28-1845.42] would be our
[1845.42-1848.38] baseline
[1848.38-1848.82] so
[1848.82-1851.32] for this year
[1851.32-1852.32] this payout ratio
[1852.32-1853.72] what I can have
[1853.72-1855.64] the very preliminary
[1855.64-1857.00] commitment would be
[1857.00-1857.76] at least
[1857.76-1859.32] 50%
[1859.32-1862.18] this will be
[1862.18-1862.82] this year
[1862.82-1863.64] but of course
[1863.64-1865.18] if our board
[1865.18-1866.10] can accept
[1866.10-1867.30] a more aggressive
[1867.30-1867.90] payout
[1867.90-1868.56] then that would be
[1868.56-1869.20] a good news
[1869.20-1870.36] for investor anyway
[1870.36-1870.74] but
[1870.74-1873.68] we actually
[1873.68-1874.54] had some
[1874.54-1875.32] add up in
[1875.32-1875.96] our
[1875.96-1877.34] incremental
[1877.34-1879.50] bips
[1879.50-1880.44] for our
[1880.44-1881.26] RW
[1881.26-1881.30] bips
[1881.32-1882.32] and
[1882.32-1883.56] to help
[1883.56-1884.38] to reduce
[1884.38-1885.72] the overall
[1885.72-1886.92] risk asset
[1886.92-1889.42] quality
[1889.42-1890.26] that
[1890.26-1892.92] would
[1892.92-1893.80] give us
[1893.80-1894.34] some room
[1894.34-1894.98] to
[1894.98-1896.42] propose
[1896.42-1897.22] to the board
[1897.22-1898.30] that we may
[1898.30-1899.98] lift a bit
[1899.98-1901.40] to pay out
[1901.40-1902.08] some cash
[1902.08-1902.48] dividend
[1902.48-1903.40] to the investors
[1903.40-1903.86] but
[1903.86-1905.16] it's still
[1905.16-1906.60] subject to
[1906.60-1907.38] the final
[1907.38-1908.58] decision
[1908.58-1909.42] of the board
[1909.42-1909.88] so
[1909.88-1911.12] what I can
[1911.12-1912.66] elaborate
[1912.66-1913.46] here would be
[1913.46-1916.36] 50%
[1916.36-1917.40] payout ratio
[1917.40-1918.62] of the base
[1918.62-1920.08] and if there's
[1920.08-1920.72] any more
[1920.72-1921.18] add up
[1921.18-1922.42] we have to
[1922.42-1924.08] have more
[1924.08-1924.90] discussion
[1924.90-1926.04] in our board
[1926.04-1926.64] ok
[1926.64-1928.76] when we
[1928.76-1929.26] move on
[1929.26-1929.68] to the
[1929.68-1930.28] RWB
[1930.28-1932.70] application
[1932.70-1933.28] next year
[1933.28-1933.96] yes
[1933.96-1935.10] we would have
[1935.10-1936.22] 3%
[1936.22-1936.72] more
[1936.72-1938.28] to add up
[1938.28-1939.04] on our
[1939.04-1940.10] capital
[1940.10-1940.68] advocacy
[1940.68-1941.10] ratio
[1941.12-1941.88] so that
[1941.88-1942.40] would be
[1942.40-1943.24] significantly
[1943.24-1943.84] help
[1943.84-1944.48] a boost
[1944.48-1945.40] to
[1945.40-1947.16] free us
[1947.16-1949.08] from our
[1949.08-1950.02] very conservative
[1950.02-1951.16] dividend
[1951.16-1952.26] policy
[1952.26-1953.54] and let us
[1953.54-1953.94] can
[1953.94-1955.64] actually
[1955.64-1957.56] deliver
[1957.56-1958.76] more aggressive
[1958.76-1959.70] dividend
[1959.70-1960.34] payout
[1960.34-1961.12] but
[1961.12-1962.14] we will have
[1962.14-1962.80] to wait for
[1962.80-1963.48] another year
[1963.48-1964.16] before we can
[1964.16-1964.54] really
[1964.54-1965.70] actually reach
[1965.70-1967.10] that level
[1967.10-1968.08] so for this year
[1968.08-1969.58] 50%
[1969.58-1970.46] ok
[1970.46-1971.10] but that's
[1971.12-1971.88] there may be
[1971.88-1972.36] some add up
[1972.36-1972.86] but we
[1972.86-1973.36] we have to
[1973.36-1974.22] wait until
[1974.22-1976.02] the final decision
[1976.02-1976.88] by the board
[1976.88-1978.22] anyway
[1978.22-1979.52] and next year
[1979.52-1979.82] yes
[1979.82-1980.48] we will
[1980.48-1981.68] pay more
[1981.68-1982.46] but we
[1982.46-1983.22] will have
[1983.22-1983.72] one more
[1983.72-1986.68] year ahead
[1986.68-1987.40] ok
[1987.40-1988.60] so
[1988.60-1989.20] we would
[1989.20-1989.84] say
[1989.84-1990.40] more
[1990.40-1991.32] conserve
[1991.32-1992.32] right now
[1992.32-1992.96] it's
[1992.96-1993.84] at least
[1993.84-1995.72] 50%
[1995.72-1997.00] for cash
[1997.00-1997.64] and
[1997.64-1999.24] maybe
[1999.24-2000.12] depending
[2000.12-2001.04] on
[2001.04-2002.04] our management
[2002.04-2002.64] team
[2002.64-2003.04] maybe
[2003.04-2003.48] there will
[2003.48-2003.84] be
[2003.84-2004.80] a little bit
[2004.80-2006.74] add up
[2006.74-2009.54] and
[2009.54-2011.08] another
[2011.08-2011.58] issue
[2011.58-2012.24] is about
[2012.24-2013.00] our fee
[2013.00-2014.18] income
[2014.18-2015.38] since
[2015.38-2015.80] our
[2015.80-2017.38] 20 24
[2017.38-2018.38] fee income
[2018.38-2019.04] was
[2019.04-2019.40] pretty
[2019.40-2021.04] aggressive
[2021.04-2021.44] in our
[2021.44-2021.92] slide
[2021.92-2023.68] it shows
[2023.68-2024.48] we had
[2024.48-2025.92] 34%
[2025.92-2026.56] growth
[2026.56-2027.52] while why
[2027.52-2028.20] especially
[2028.20-2028.76] from the
[2028.76-2029.60] wealth management
[2029.60-2030.36] it's about
[2030.36-2031.02] over
[2031.04-2031.80] 40%
[2031.80-2032.60] growth
[2032.60-2033.28] so what
[2033.28-2034.48] about our
[2034.48-2035.28] outlook for
[2035.28-2036.06] our fee
[2036.06-2036.88] income for
[2036.88-2037.48] 20
[2037.48-2038.10] 25
[2038.10-2041.32] after we
[2041.32-2043.42] reach this
[2043.42-2044.90] historical
[2044.90-2045.76] high growth
[2045.76-2046.38] in the
[2046.38-2047.32] fee revenue
[2047.32-2048.06] this year
[2048.06-2048.56] will be
[2048.56-2049.22] a very
[2049.22-2049.84] challenging
[2049.84-2050.12] year
[2050.12-2050.88] that
[2050.88-2051.74] maintain
[2051.74-2052.38] the momentum
[2052.38-2053.42] but
[2053.42-2055.80] the good
[2055.80-2056.24] thing is
[2056.24-2057.28] the capital
[2057.28-2058.00] market still
[2058.00-2058.42] remains
[2058.42-2059.20] pretty much
[2059.20-2060.02] robust
[2060.02-2060.96] and aggressive
[2060.96-2061.02] and
[2061.02-2063.36] we would
[2063.36-2063.92] manage
[2063.92-2064.40] to grow
[2064.40-2065.50] our wealth
[2065.50-2065.96] management
[2065.96-2066.52] business
[2066.52-2067.60] by growing
[2067.60-2068.70] about
[2068.70-2070.30] 12%
[2070.30-2071.98] double digit
[2071.98-2072.38] growth
[2072.38-2073.06] but not
[2073.06-2073.60] as high
[2073.60-2074.56] as 30
[2074.56-2075.44] 40%
[2075.44-2075.96] last year
[2075.96-2076.40] due to
[2076.40-2076.84] the high
[2076.84-2077.54] space period
[2077.54-2078.22] phenomenon
[2078.22-2079.94] and another
[2079.94-2081.28] factor
[2081.28-2081.66] would be
[2081.66-2082.20] last year
[2082.20-2082.66] the
[2082.66-2084.02] long related
[2084.02-2084.76] fee
[2084.76-2087.02] would have
[2087.02-2087.82] so called
[2087.82-2088.50] one time
[2088.50-2089.02] number
[2089.02-2091.84] that the
[2091.84-2092.86] high speed rail
[2092.86-2093.50] break up
[2093.50-2094.14] fee
[2094.14-2095.90] did
[2095.90-2097.26] some impact
[2097.26-2097.98] that this year
[2097.98-2098.58] no longer
[2098.58-2099.52] existed
[2099.52-2100.14] so the
[2100.14-2100.88] non wealth
[2100.88-2102.56] man
[2102.56-2103.36] fee revenue
[2103.36-2104.18] would stay
[2104.18-2105.42] flatish
[2105.42-2106.18] and overall
[2106.18-2107.20] our fee revenue
[2107.20-2108.16] would
[2108.16-2108.68] manage to
[2108.68-2109.36] grow by
[2109.36-2110.78] 7 to 8%
[2110.78-2112.06] which
[2112.06-2112.44] would be our
[2112.44-2113.02] target to
[2113.02-2113.98] grow our
[2113.98-2115.42] fee
[2115.42-2115.96] income
[2115.96-2116.72] by high
[2116.72-2117.04] single
[2117.04-2117.70] digit
[2117.70-2118.50] manly driven
[2118.50-2118.84] by
[2118.84-2119.42] wealth
[2119.42-2119.86] management
[2119.86-2120.12] at
[2120.12-2122.16] 12%
[2122.16-2122.68] this year
[2122.68-2124.98] okay
[2124.98-2125.50] thank you
[2125.50-2126.00] any
[2126.00-2127.28] so
[2127.28-2128.32] we think
[2128.32-2128.64] our
[2128.64-2128.96] fee
[2128.96-2129.18] income
[2129.18-2129.78] will still
[2129.78-2130.30] have the
[2130.30-2130.84] momentum
[2130.84-2131.12] even
[2131.12-2132.22] maybe
[2132.22-2133.20] the
[2133.20-2134.38] growth rate
[2134.38-2135.60] will not
[2135.60-2136.04] be that
[2136.04-2136.80] aggressive
[2136.80-2137.52] but still
[2137.52-2138.56] keep the
[2138.56-2139.28] momentum
[2139.28-2140.36] and so
[2140.36-2141.46] if you
[2141.46-2143.20] have any
[2143.20-2144.04] questions
[2144.04-2144.72] want to ask
[2144.72-2145.24] you can
[2145.24-2145.60] type
[2145.60-2146.62] your question
[2146.62-2146.98] at the
[2146.98-2147.62] button
[2147.62-2148.58] box
[2148.58-2148.66] and
[2148.66-2149.42] so far
[2149.42-2149.94] there is
[2149.94-2150.96] no more
[2150.96-2151.74] question
[2151.74-2152.50] coming in
[2152.50-2153.78] i'd like
[2153.78-2156.34] tomay be
[2156.34-2157.62] to ask
[2157.62-2158.64] any to
[2158.64-2159.16] baby
[2159.16-2159.92] give us
[2159.92-2161.72] some
[2161.72-2162.48] more outlook
[2162.48-2163.50] about our
[2163.50-2164.02] overs
[2164.02-2165.30] deployment
[2165.30-2166.32] for next
[2166.32-2166.84] year because
[2166.84-2168.62] some of
[2168.62-2169.14] you might know
[2169.14-2169.90] that we have
[2169.90-2170.94] new branches
[2170.94-2172.22] in osaka
[2172.22-2173.50] and maybe
[2173.50-2174.52] what's our
[2174.52-2175.28] our plan for
[2175.28-2176.30] our overseas
[2176.30-2176.82] issue
[2178.66-2181.48] well we
[2181.48-2182.50] plan to
[2182.50-2183.26] open our
[2183.26-2184.54] long office
[2184.54-2186.08] in osaka
[2186.08-2187.10] in the third
[2187.10-2187.88] quarter this year
[2187.88-2189.16] in order to capture
[2189.16-2190.06] the business
[2190.06-2191.58] opportunities arising
[2191.58-2192.82] the relocation
[2192.82-2193.76] of the
[2193.76-2195.24] the talent
[2195.24-2195.80] company
[2195.80-2196.64] particularly
[2196.64-2197.66] for the
[2197.66-2198.54] tech sectors
[2198.54-2199.54] and
[2199.54-2200.82] apart from
[2200.82-2202.28] japan markets
[2202.28-2203.58] we actually
[2203.58-2204.64] had a very
[2204.64-2205.54] completed
[2205.54-2207.58] branching
[2207.58-2207.64] service
[2208.28-2208.64] and then
[2208.64-2209.40] network in
[2209.40-2210.94] us market
[2210.94-2211.46] we actually
[2211.46-2214.28] have four
[2214.28-2215.30] offices in
[2215.30-2216.84] the us market
[2216.84-2218.36] which is
[2218.36-2219.14] pretty much
[2219.14-2220.42] beneficial to
[2220.42-2221.96] the so called
[2221.96-2222.98] new trump
[2222.98-2224.00] administrations
[2224.00-2225.02] policy that
[2225.02-2226.56] would
[2226.56-2227.58] attract more
[2227.58-2228.36] investment
[2228.36-2229.38] in
[2229.38-2230.14] us
[2230.14-2232.20] so i would
[2232.20-2233.22] say that
[2233.22-2235.26] in
[2237.32-2238.26] in the next
[2238.26-2240.06] one or two years
[2240.06-2240.82] our us
[2240.82-2243.12] branching
[2243.12-2244.14] offices
[2244.14-2244.92] would
[2244.92-2246.20] give a
[2246.20-2247.22] good boost
[2247.22-2249.02] to
[2249.02-2250.04] help the
[2250.04-2251.06] the talent
[2251.06-2252.08] business
[2252.08-2253.36] especially for
[2253.36-2254.14] those tech
[2254.14-2255.66] sectors to
[2255.66-2256.70] rebuild
[2256.70-2257.72] their
[2257.72-2259.50] supply chain
[2259.50-2260.54] or the investment
[2260.54-2262.06] in us market
[2262.06-2263.10] and that would be
[2263.10-2263.86] our niche
[2263.86-2265.40] that we have deployed
[2265.40-2267.18] or had the
[2267.18-2268.22] experience
[2268.26-2270.06] in the us market
[2270.06-2271.08] for many years
[2271.08-2273.12] i suppose
[2273.12-2274.14] that the
[2274.14-2276.46] the global
[2276.46-2277.74] trend
[2277.74-2279.52] that
[2279.52-2280.80] the supply chain
[2280.80-2281.58] would become
[2281.58-2282.60] more localized
[2282.60-2284.38] that would help
[2284.38-2285.42] a bank like
[2285.42-2286.44] like us
[2286.44-2287.72] to capture
[2287.72-2288.48] this
[2288.48-2290.02] opportunity
[2290.02-2291.30] to serve the
[2291.30-2294.38] local business
[2294.38-2296.94] so i guess that
[2296.94-2298.22] this would be our
[2298.22-2299.50] future
[2299.50-2301.54] plan to further
[2301.54-2303.34] serve those
[2303.34-2304.62] overseas
[2304.62-2305.64] talent business
[2305.64-2306.92] to build up their
[2306.92-2307.70] new
[2307.70-2308.98] manufacturer
[2308.98-2310.26] site
[2310.26-2312.04] and help them
[2312.04-2313.58] to expand their business
[2313.58-2314.10] there
[2314.10-2315.38] so i
[2315.38-2316.66] guess that i would
[2316.66-2317.94] particularly highlight our
[2317.94-2318.96] us market
[2318.96-2319.98] business
[2319.98-2321.00] in the future
[2321.00-2322.02] okay
[2322.02-2323.30] thank you annie
[2323.30-2324.58] and
[2324.58-2326.64] there is no more
[2326.64-2328.18] questions coming in
[2328.22-2329.76] so maybe
[2329.76-2332.32] most of you
[2332.32-2333.34] have no concern
[2333.34-2335.14] about our
[2335.14-2335.90] management
[2335.90-2337.44] operation
[2337.44-2339.48] so that's a good news for us
[2339.48-2340.50] and so any
[2340.50-2341.54] do you have any
[2341.54-2342.56] conclusion
[2342.56-2344.86] for
[2344.86-2346.40] today's conference
[2346.40-2347.94] or maybe we will
[2347.94-2349.46] end up meeting
[2349.46-2351.78] here
[2351.78-2355.36] okay i would like to further highlight that we
[2355.36-2357.66] after we clean up the balance sheet in the overseas market
[2357.66-2360.98] particularly in the developed countries
[2360.98-2362.02] that
[2362.02-2364.58] that will help us to
[2364.58-2369.18] have more chances that
[2369.18-2374.04] rebuild our balance sheet in this countries
[2374.04-2375.84] especially in the north
[2375.84-2377.62] america market
[2377.62-2382.74] so i will see that our
[2382.74-2385.06] future plans to
[2385.06-2387.10] connect to our franchise from today
[2387.10-2391.30] 从台湾到外国市场
[2391.30-2396.32] 可以是我们能够更多的
[2396.32-2397.86] 增长我们的电脑
[2397.86-2400.34] 我们其实目标是
[2400.34-2401.82] 我们能够重新提升
[2401.82-2403.28] 我们的外国利润
[2403.28-2407.16] 从30%以下
[2407.16-2410.78] 到逐渐增长到30%或40%
[2410.78-2415.20] 希望这会帮助我们
[2415.20-2418.30] 更加增长我们的市场
[2418.30-2420.92] 因为传统上
[2420.92-2422.20] 市场的费用
[2422.20-2422.62] 我意思是
[2422.62-2424.00] 在外国市场的费用
[2424.00-2427.84] 会比台湾的费用
[2427.84-2428.40] 更加激烈
[2428.40-2431.18] 因为竞争不那么激烈
[2431.18-2432.64] 所以这会是
[2432.64-2433.70] 我们的最好的消息
[2433.70-2439.00] 我会更加更新
[2439.00-2443.42] 我们的未来的计划
[2443.42-2445.18] 我们的未来的计划
[2445.18-2445.20] 我们的未来的计划
[2445.20-2475.18] 我们的未来的计划
[2475.18-2484.34] 我们的未来的计划
